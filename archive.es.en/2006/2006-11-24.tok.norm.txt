juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .

his friends accuse the kremlin of poisoning litvinenko to stop his investigation into the unsolved murder of russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya who was shot in moscow in october .
british police have launched an inquiry into what they called the " unexplained death " and have previously said they suspected deliberate poisoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko doctors at london 's university college hospital said they had n't been able to establish what caused the rapid deterioration in litvinenko 's health . litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of russian president vladmir putin , fled russia six years ago and was granted political asylum in britain . the kremlin has denied involvement in litvinenko 's death .
a russian spokesperson said on the sidelines of the eu-russia summit in helsinki that britain must probe the death . " death is always a tragedy , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not up to british officials to investigate the death . putin is expected to face awkward questions over litvinenko 's death at the summit in finland , which holds the current eu presidency . putin is also expected to come under pressure to drop a year-old ban on polish meat and other foodstuffs , which has led poland to veto an eu mandate for negotiations on an eu-russia partnership . eu-russia pact expires next year the eu had hoped to use the helsinki summit to launch talks with russia for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal which expires at the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has massive oil and gas and gas reserves " of course it would be better not to have -lrb- the polish veto -rrb- but we are going to keep on working , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said as he arrived at the summit venue .

" poland needs support in the trade dispute , and we share their concerns .
russia 's tendency to link trade with politics is not acceptable .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ? " the question , ' how can something like this happen ? ' is absolutely justified and must be answered , " müller-piepenkötter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention center in siegburg but others are skeptical about the justice minister 's decision to set up a panel to look into the issue .

" it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ? " the question , ' how can something like this happen ? ' is absolutely justified and must be answered , " müller-piepenkötter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention center in siegburg but others are skeptical about the justice minister 's decision to set up a panel to look into the issue . " there is nothing new to learn , " said bernd-rüdiger sonnen , the head of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders -lrb- dvjj -rrb- , an umbrella association advocating the rights of young offenders . " it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .
then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ? " the question , ' how can something like this happen ? ' is absolutely justified and must be answered , " müller-piepenkötter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention center in siegburg but others are skeptical about the justice minister 's decision to set up a panel to look into the issue . " there is nothing new to learn , " said bernd-rüdiger sonnen , the head of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders -lrb- dvjj -rrb- , an umbrella association advocating the rights of young offenders . " it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .
then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .
" it is tied into the structures , with how people are incarcerated . " avoiding the mob mentality for instance , his group strongly opposes having groups of four people living in one cell as it can lead to a mob mentality where three stronger prisoners gang up on one weak one - as in the case of hermann h. instead , his group advocates a setup in which a group of up to 12 juvenile offenders would each have his or her own room , but would share some common space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire is commonplace at german juvenile halls sonnen sees an upside to the siegburg tragedy : it is a chance for groups like his own to educate the public about the serious need for change in the juvenile court system .
the topic is especially relevant because german states must adopt laws regulating juvenile detention facilities by may 2007 .
currently , none exist . " this is a huge opportunity for us , people can not look away from this case , " said sonnen , whose group is actively lobbying politicians in charge of creating the new detention center laws . reform , not punish " people tend to say : ' just give them more , longer punishments - they need to feel the full weight of the law , " ' sonnen said .
" but we know that type of treatment just leads to higher recidivism rates . " in fact , he said , juvenile correction facilities are supposed to educate and reform youth , not just punish them . " that 's what is different about youth correction , " he said .
" they are n't incarcerated just in order to pay for a crime , but with the goal of stopping them from committing further crimes .

afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts . the prices of illicit drugs in the european union keep dropping , in spite of record levels of seizures involving cannabis , heroin , cocaine and amphetamines , in particular the mind-altering drug ecstasy .
the findings were published in a report on thursday by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction . " there are signs in some countries that ecstasy and cocaine are cheaper today than in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " according to the agency 's annual report .
in spite of record levels of drug seizures and successful efforts to stem the flow of cocaine imports from south america , officials at the drug monitoring agency say that they are failing to hit newer routes used by drug traffickers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 1.5 million europeans consume the hard stuff , such as cocaine , regularly an analysis of street prices based on data from 29 countries - the 25 eu members , plus bulgaria , norway , turkey , and romania - showed that average prices for most substances , adjusted for inflation , had fallen from 1999 to 2004 , with the price of ecstasy down by 47 percent , heroin by 45 percent , cocaine by 22 percent and cannabis dropping to 19 percent . although black market prices have dropped significantly , there still remain considerable price differences within europe . the use of cannabis , the plant from which marijuana and hashish are derived , is the most widespread of all illegal drugs , according to the eu study . some 20 percent of the population in europe has tried it at least once , with its use not only confined to young people .
many habitual users continue smoking marijuana or hashish well into their 30s and 40s . " afghans producing heroin like hell " a main source of illicit drugs is afghanistan , according to wolfgang götz , head of the eu drug monitoring center , who said that the afghans were " producing heroin like hell , " with its opium crop supplying 89 percent of europe 's heroin . " the global supply for heroin is now exceeding global demand , " added götz . whether the fall in drug prices reflects changes in supply or demand or both , is unclear , although the agency expressed concern about a rise in illegal drug consumption among juveniles , with the highest rates of abuse among youth in spain , france and britain .
amphetamine and cocaine abuse is highest in britain according to the report , with consumption rising in the entire eu .
some 1.5 million europeans consume these hard drugs regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mind-altering drug ecstasy has become a favorite on the party circuit heroin abuse , on the other hand , has become less widespread , though it remains the most addictive of all illicit drugs and accounts for 60 percent of those who seek help .
to curb the spread of aids and other infectious diseases among drug addicts , most eu countries now offer public programs that distribute sterile needles or replacement drugs to help wean addicts off the most potent substances . according to götz , 1.7 million europeans have drug problems , meaning that they regularly consume hard drugs , much of which is self injected .
on an annual basis , between 7,000 and 8,000 europeans die of drug-related overdoses , mostly from heroin , but also from cocaine , in particular its potent derivative , crack . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life between drugs , work and hierarchy for german prisoners germany 's 200 prisons hold more than 60,000 inmates and a further 14,000 awaiting trials .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .

german parliamentarians also told the organization it needed to expand its work in asia and the arab world . one of the main vehicles for promoting germany 's culture and language around the world , the goethe institute has been forced to watch its budget drop by 16 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- over the last 10 years and had recently been embroiled in a controversial debate about its future operations . politicians in germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , said friday that a turnaround is at hand , adding that they planned to increase the institute 's finances by 13.5 million euros to a total of about 120 million euros . the added money is planned to enable the organization to expand its network of 144 institutes in 80 countries , members of the committee for foreign culture and education said . there are two tasks that need to be completed for the goethe institute to have positive future , according to social democrat and committee member monika griefahn . expansion ca n't come at european expense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's reading room in north korea " the goethe institute has to show that it is capable of structural change , " she said .

he said goethe officials needed to work more closely with other german institutions abroad , including the german academic exchange service and the humboldt foundation . modernizing administrative practices in addition to teaming up with other german organizations , the foreign cultural policy committee has told the institute it needs to modernize its administrative practices , social democrat lothar mark said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute has offices in 80 countries " the goethe institute has not made any structural adjustments over the past few years , " he said .
" this naturally created a structural deficit . " mark added that the organization needed to set realistic goals based on its budget and consider lowering its costs by moving out of particularly expensive locations in favor of cheaper real estate . germany 's foreign culture flagship german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said he was " very satisfied " with the goethe institute 's work . steinmeier , who said he has a plan of the direction he 'd like the organization to take , has made it a point to visit the institutes in his many trips abroad , registering more goethe visits in his one year in office as germany 's top diplomat than his predecessor , joschka fischer , did during six years in office . " more ambition in foreign schools and more ambition in scientific exchanges , that is what we should deal with over the next years , " said steinmeier , whose ministry is responsible for keeping up foreign political as well as cultural ties .

afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts . the prices of illicit drugs in the european union keep dropping , in spite of record levels of seizures involving cannabis , heroin , cocaine and amphetamines , in particular the mind-altering drug ecstasy .
the findings were published in a report on thursday by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction . " there are signs in some countries that ecstasy and cocaine are cheaper today than in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " according to the agency 's annual report .
in spite of record levels of drug seizures and successful efforts to stem the flow of cocaine imports from south america , officials at the drug monitoring agency say that they are failing to hit newer routes used by drug traffickers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 1.5 million europeans consume the hard stuff , such as cocaine , regularly an analysis of street prices based on data from 29 countries - the 25 eu members , plus bulgaria , norway , turkey , and romania - showed that average prices for most substances , adjusted for inflation , had fallen from 1999 to 2004 , with the price of ecstasy down by 47 percent , heroin by 45 percent , cocaine by 22 percent and cannabis dropping to 19 percent . although black market prices have dropped significantly , there still remain considerable price differences within europe . the use of cannabis , the plant from which marijuana and hashish are derived , is the most widespread of all illegal drugs , according to the eu study . some 20 percent of the population in europe has tried it at least once , with its use not only confined to young people .
many habitual users continue smoking marijuana or hashish well into their 30s and 40s . " afghans producing heroin like hell " a main source of illicit drugs is afghanistan , according to wolfgang götz , head of the eu drug monitoring center , who said that the afghans were " producing heroin like hell , " with its opium crop supplying 89 percent of europe 's heroin . " the global supply for heroin is now exceeding global demand , " added götz . whether the fall in drug prices reflects changes in supply or demand or both , is unclear , although the agency expressed concern about a rise in illegal drug consumption among juveniles , with the highest rates of abuse among youth in spain , france and britain .
amphetamine and cocaine abuse is highest in britain according to the report , with consumption rising in the entire eu .
some 1.5 million europeans consume these hard drugs regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mind-altering drug ecstasy has become a favorite on the party circuit heroin abuse , on the other hand , has become less widespread , though it remains the most addictive of all illicit drugs and accounts for 60 percent of those who seek help .
to curb the spread of aids and other infectious diseases among drug addicts , most eu countries now offer public programs that distribute sterile needles or replacement drugs to help wean addicts off the most potent substances . according to götz , 1.7 million europeans have drug problems , meaning that they regularly consume hard drugs , much of which is self injected .
on an annual basis , between 7,000 and 8,000 europeans die of drug-related overdoses , mostly from heroin , but also from cocaine , in particular its potent derivative , crack . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life between drugs , work and hierarchy for german prisoners germany 's 200 prisons hold more than 60,000 inmates and a further 14,000 awaiting trials .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .

his friends accuse the kremlin of poisoning litvinenko to stop his investigation into the unsolved murder of russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya who was shot in moscow in october .
british police have launched an inquiry into what they called the " unexplained death " and have previously said they suspected deliberate poisoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko doctors at london 's university college hospital said they had n't been able to establish what caused the rapid deterioration in litvinenko 's health . litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of russian president vladmir putin , fled russia six years ago and was granted political asylum in britain . the kremlin has denied involvement in litvinenko 's death .
a russian spokesperson said on the sidelines of the eu-russia summit in helsinki that britain must probe the death . " death is always a tragedy , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not up to british officials to investigate the death . putin is expected to face awkward questions over litvinenko 's death at the summit in finland , which holds the current eu presidency . putin is also expected to come under pressure to drop a year-old ban on polish meat and other foodstuffs , which has led poland to veto an eu mandate for negotiations on an eu-russia partnership . eu-russia pact expires next year the eu had hoped to use the helsinki summit to launch talks with russia for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal which expires at the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has massive oil and gas and gas reserves " of course it would be better not to have -lrb- the polish veto -rrb- but we are going to keep on working , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said as he arrived at the summit venue .

" poland is right to raise the issue , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said earlier this week .
" poland needs support in the trade dispute , and we share their concerns .
russia 's tendency to link trade with politics is not acceptable . " yet the stakes are getting higher in the meat dispute , for russia has announced it could ban animal product imports from the eu in january , when bulgaria and romania join the bloc . " unfortunately , eu members , while adopting the decisions on accession of these countries , did not think it necessary to consult with us on questions that are of interest to all parties , " putin said on thursday in helsinki . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland scuppers eu talks on russia deal poland on monday blocked eu attempts to hold talks with russia over a new cooperation pact , demanding first a clear sign from moscow that its demands on trade and energy will be met .

afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts . the prices of illicit drugs in the european union keep dropping , in spite of record levels of seizures involving cannabis , heroin , cocaine and amphetamines , in particular the mind-altering drug ecstasy .
the findings were published in a report on thursday by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction . " there are signs in some countries that ecstasy and cocaine are cheaper today than in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " according to the agency 's annual report .
in spite of record levels of drug seizures and successful efforts to stem the flow of cocaine imports from south america , officials at the drug monitoring agency say that they are failing to hit newer routes used by drug traffickers .

" the global supply for heroin is now exceeding global demand , " added götz . whether the fall in drug prices reflects changes in supply or demand or both , is unclear , although the agency expressed concern about a rise in illegal drug consumption among juveniles , with the highest rates of abuse among youth in spain , france and britain .
amphetamine and cocaine abuse is highest in britain according to the report , with consumption rising in the entire eu .
some 1.5 million europeans consume these hard drugs regularly .

to curb the spread of aids and other infectious diseases among drug addicts , most eu countries now offer public programs that distribute sterile needles or replacement drugs to help wean addicts off the most potent substances . according to götz , 1.7 million europeans have drug problems , meaning that they regularly consume hard drugs , much of which is self injected .

german parliamentarians also told the organization it needed to expand its work in asia and the arab world . one of the main vehicles for promoting germany 's culture and language around the world , the goethe institute has been forced to watch its budget drop by 16 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- over the last 10 years and had recently been embroiled in a controversial debate about its future operations . politicians in germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , said friday that a turnaround is at hand , adding that they planned to increase the institute 's finances by 13.5 million euros to a total of about 120 million euros . the added money is planned to enable the organization to expand its network of 144 institutes in 80 countries , members of the committee for foreign culture and education said . there are two tasks that need to be completed for the goethe institute to have positive future , according to social democrat and committee member monika griefahn . expansion ca n't come at european expense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's reading room in north korea " the goethe institute has to show that it is capable of structural change , " she said .
" and we have to bear the new challenges facing us in new regions like eastern europe , asia and the arabic world . " after months of discussion in the committee , several politicians said friday that the institute 's expansion in asian and islamic countries was of particular importance . " the number one task is spreading and fostering of the german language in foreign countries , " said christian democrat peter gauweiler , who co-authored a report with griefahn planning the institute 's future . expansion around the globe can not come at the expense of activities closer to home , as there is still work to do in europe , gauweiler added .
he said goethe officials needed to work more closely with other german institutions abroad , including the german academic exchange service and the humboldt foundation . modernizing administrative practices in addition to teaming up with other german organizations , the foreign cultural policy committee has told the institute it needs to modernize its administrative practices , social democrat lothar mark said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute has offices in 80 countries " the goethe institute has not made any structural adjustments over the past few years , " he said .
" this naturally created a structural deficit . " mark added that the organization needed to set realistic goals based on its budget and consider lowering its costs by moving out of particularly expensive locations in favor of cheaper real estate . germany 's foreign culture flagship german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said he was " very satisfied " with the goethe institute 's work . steinmeier , who said he has a plan of the direction he 'd like the organization to take , has made it a point to visit the institutes in his many trips abroad , registering more goethe visits in his one year in office as germany 's top diplomat than his predecessor , joschka fischer , did during six years in office . " more ambition in foreign schools and more ambition in scientific exchanges , that is what we should deal with over the next years , " said steinmeier , whose ministry is responsible for keeping up foreign political as well as cultural ties .

afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts . the prices of illicit drugs in the european union keep dropping , in spite of record levels of seizures involving cannabis , heroin , cocaine and amphetamines , in particular the mind-altering drug ecstasy .
the findings were published in a report on thursday by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction . " there are signs in some countries that ecstasy and cocaine are cheaper today than in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " according to the agency 's annual report .
in spite of record levels of drug seizures and successful efforts to stem the flow of cocaine imports from south america , officials at the drug monitoring agency say that they are failing to hit newer routes used by drug traffickers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 1.5 million europeans consume the hard stuff , such as cocaine , regularly an analysis of street prices based on data from 29 countries - the 25 eu members , plus bulgaria , norway , turkey , and romania - showed that average prices for most substances , adjusted for inflation , had fallen from 1999 to 2004 , with the price of ecstasy down by 47 percent , heroin by 45 percent , cocaine by 22 percent and cannabis dropping to 19 percent . although black market prices have dropped significantly , there still remain considerable price differences within europe . the use of cannabis , the plant from which marijuana and hashish are derived , is the most widespread of all illegal drugs , according to the eu study . some 20 percent of the population in europe has tried it at least once , with its use not only confined to young people .
many habitual users continue smoking marijuana or hashish well into their 30s and 40s . " afghans producing heroin like hell " a main source of illicit drugs is afghanistan , according to wolfgang götz , head of the eu drug monitoring center , who said that the afghans were " producing heroin like hell , " with its opium crop supplying 89 percent of europe 's heroin . " the global supply for heroin is now exceeding global demand , " added götz . whether the fall in drug prices reflects changes in supply or demand or both , is unclear , although the agency expressed concern about a rise in illegal drug consumption among juveniles , with the highest rates of abuse among youth in spain , france and britain .
amphetamine and cocaine abuse is highest in britain according to the report , with consumption rising in the entire eu .
some 1.5 million europeans consume these hard drugs regularly .

to curb the spread of aids and other infectious diseases among drug addicts , most eu countries now offer public programs that distribute sterile needles or replacement drugs to help wean addicts off the most potent substances . according to götz , 1.7 million europeans have drug problems , meaning that they regularly consume hard drugs , much of which is self injected .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 24.11.2006 illicit drug use on the rise in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the drug of choice for many as prices for illicit drugs keep dropping , juvenile drug use in some european countries is on the rise , in spite of record levels of seizures .
afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts . the prices of illicit drugs in the european union keep dropping , in spite of record levels of seizures involving cannabis , heroin , cocaine and amphetamines , in particular the mind-altering drug ecstasy .
the findings were published in a report on thursday by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction . " there are signs in some countries that ecstasy and cocaine are cheaper today than in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " according to the agency 's annual report .
in spite of record levels of drug seizures and successful efforts to stem the flow of cocaine imports from south america , officials at the drug monitoring agency say that they are failing to hit newer routes used by drug traffickers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 1.5 million europeans consume the hard stuff , such as cocaine , regularly an analysis of street prices based on data from 29 countries - the 25 eu members , plus bulgaria , norway , turkey , and romania - showed that average prices for most substances , adjusted for inflation , had fallen from 1999 to 2004 , with the price of ecstasy down by 47 percent , heroin by 45 percent , cocaine by 22 percent and cannabis dropping to 19 percent . although black market prices have dropped significantly , there still remain considerable price differences within europe . the use of cannabis , the plant from which marijuana and hashish are derived , is the most widespread of all illegal drugs , according to the eu study . some 20 percent of the population in europe has tried it at least once , with its use not only confined to young people .

his friends accuse the kremlin of poisoning litvinenko to stop his investigation into the unsolved murder of russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya who was shot in moscow in october .
british police have launched an inquiry into what they called the " unexplained death " and have previously said they suspected deliberate poisoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko doctors at london 's university college hospital said they had n't been able to establish what caused the rapid deterioration in litvinenko 's health . litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of russian president vladmir putin , fled russia six years ago and was granted political asylum in britain . the kremlin has denied involvement in litvinenko 's death .
a russian spokesperson said on the sidelines of the eu-russia summit in helsinki that britain must probe the death . " death is always a tragedy , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not up to british officials to investigate the death . putin is expected to face awkward questions over litvinenko 's death at the summit in finland , which holds the current eu presidency . putin is also expected to come under pressure to drop a year-old ban on polish meat and other foodstuffs , which has led poland to veto an eu mandate for negotiations on an eu-russia partnership . eu-russia pact expires next year the eu had hoped to use the helsinki summit to launch talks with russia for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal which expires at the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has massive oil and gas and gas reserves " of course it would be better not to have -lrb- the polish veto -rrb- but we are going to keep on working , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said as he arrived at the summit venue .

german parliamentarians also told the organization it needed to expand its work in asia and the arab world . one of the main vehicles for promoting germany 's culture and language around the world , the goethe institute has been forced to watch its budget drop by 16 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- over the last 10 years and had recently been embroiled in a controversial debate about its future operations . politicians in germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , said friday that a turnaround is at hand , adding that they planned to increase the institute 's finances by 13.5 million euros to a total of about 120 million euros . the added money is planned to enable the organization to expand its network of 144 institutes in 80 countries , members of the committee for foreign culture and education said . there are two tasks that need to be completed for the goethe institute to have positive future , according to social democrat and committee member monika griefahn . expansion ca n't come at european expense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's reading room in north korea " the goethe institute has to show that it is capable of structural change , " she said .
" and we have to bear the new challenges facing us in new regions like eastern europe , asia and the arabic world . " after months of discussion in the committee , several politicians said friday that the institute 's expansion in asian and islamic countries was of particular importance . " the number one task is spreading and fostering of the german language in foreign countries , " said christian democrat peter gauweiler , who co-authored a report with griefahn planning the institute 's future . expansion around the globe can not come at the expense of activities closer to home , as there is still work to do in europe , gauweiler added .
he said goethe officials needed to work more closely with other german institutions abroad , including the german academic exchange service and the humboldt foundation . modernizing administrative practices in addition to teaming up with other german organizations , the foreign cultural policy committee has told the institute it needs to modernize its administrative practices , social democrat lothar mark said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute has offices in 80 countries " the goethe institute has not made any structural adjustments over the past few years , " he said .
" this naturally created a structural deficit . " mark added that the organization needed to set realistic goals based on its budget and consider lowering its costs by moving out of particularly expensive locations in favor of cheaper real estate . germany 's foreign culture flagship german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said he was " very satisfied " with the goethe institute 's work . steinmeier , who said he has a plan of the direction he 'd like the organization to take , has made it a point to visit the institutes in his many trips abroad , registering more goethe visits in his one year in office as germany 's top diplomat than his predecessor , joschka fischer , did during six years in office . " more ambition in foreign schools and more ambition in scientific exchanges , that is what we should deal with over the next years , " said steinmeier , whose ministry is responsible for keeping up foreign political as well as cultural ties .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ? " the question , ' how can something like this happen ?

" there is nothing new to learn , " said bernd-rüdiger sonnen , the head of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders -lrb- dvjj -rrb- , an umbrella association advocating the rights of young offenders . " it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .
then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .
" it is tied into the structures , with how people are incarcerated . " avoiding the mob mentality for instance , his group strongly opposes having groups of four people living in one cell as it can lead to a mob mentality where three stronger prisoners gang up on one weak one - as in the case of hermann h. instead , his group advocates a setup in which a group of up to 12 juvenile offenders would each have his or her own room , but would share some common space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire is commonplace at german juvenile halls sonnen sees an upside to the siegburg tragedy : it is a chance for groups like his own to educate the public about the serious need for change in the juvenile court system .
the topic is especially relevant because german states must adopt laws regulating juvenile detention facilities by may 2007 .
currently , none exist . " this is a huge opportunity for us , people can not look away from this case , " said sonnen , whose group is actively lobbying politicians in charge of creating the new detention center laws . reform , not punish " people tend to say : ' just give them more , longer punishments - they need to feel the full weight of the law , " ' sonnen said .
" but we know that type of treatment just leads to higher recidivism rates . " in fact , he said , juvenile correction facilities are supposed to educate and reform youth , not just punish them . " that 's what is different about youth correction , " he said .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .

his friends accuse the kremlin of poisoning litvinenko to stop his investigation into the unsolved murder of russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya who was shot in moscow in october .
british police have launched an inquiry into what they called the " unexplained death " and have previously said they suspected deliberate poisoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko doctors at london 's university college hospital said they had n't been able to establish what caused the rapid deterioration in litvinenko 's health . litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of russian president vladmir putin , fled russia six years ago and was granted political asylum in britain . the kremlin has denied involvement in litvinenko 's death .
a russian spokesperson said on the sidelines of the eu-russia summit in helsinki that britain must probe the death . " death is always a tragedy , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not up to british officials to investigate the death . putin is expected to face awkward questions over litvinenko 's death at the summit in finland , which holds the current eu presidency . putin is also expected to come under pressure to drop a year-old ban on polish meat and other foodstuffs , which has led poland to veto an eu mandate for negotiations on an eu-russia partnership . eu-russia pact expires next year the eu had hoped to use the helsinki summit to launch talks with russia for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal which expires at the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has massive oil and gas and gas reserves " of course it would be better not to have -lrb- the polish veto -rrb- but we are going to keep on working , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said as he arrived at the summit venue .
" the situation will be overcome . " the planned new partnership deal includes eu demands for better and secure access to russia 's vast oil and gas resources and russian commitments to secure energy supplies into the 25-member bloc - the biggest consumers of russian oil . poland isolating itself germany 's deputy foreign minister , gernot erler , said poland was sidelining itself by refusing to lift its veto on opening the talks .

" poland is right to raise the issue , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said earlier this week .
" poland needs support in the trade dispute , and we share their concerns .
russia 's tendency to link trade with politics is not acceptable . " yet the stakes are getting higher in the meat dispute , for russia has announced it could ban animal product imports from the eu in january , when bulgaria and romania join the bloc .

" death is always a tragedy , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not up to british officials to investigate the death . putin is expected to face awkward questions over litvinenko 's death at the summit in finland , which holds the current eu presidency . putin is also expected to come under pressure to drop a year-old ban on polish meat and other foodstuffs , which has led poland to veto an eu mandate for negotiations on an eu-russia partnership . eu-russia pact expires next year the eu had hoped to use the helsinki summit to launch talks with russia for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal which expires at the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has massive oil and gas and gas reserves " of course it would be better not to have -lrb- the polish veto -rrb- but we are going to keep on working , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said as he arrived at the summit venue .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ? " the question , ' how can something like this happen ? ' is absolutely justified and must be answered , " müller-piepenkötter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention center in siegburg but others are skeptical about the justice minister 's decision to set up a panel to look into the issue . " there is nothing new to learn , " said bernd-rüdiger sonnen , the head of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders -lrb- dvjj -rrb- , an umbrella association advocating the rights of young offenders . " it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .
then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .
" it is tied into the structures , with how people are incarcerated . " avoiding the mob mentality for instance , his group strongly opposes having groups of four people living in one cell as it can lead to a mob mentality where three stronger prisoners gang up on one weak one - as in the case of hermann h. instead , his group advocates a setup in which a group of up to 12 juvenile offenders would each have his or her own room , but would share some common space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire is commonplace at german juvenile halls sonnen sees an upside to the siegburg tragedy : it is a chance for groups like his own to educate the public about the serious need for change in the juvenile court system .
the topic is especially relevant because german states must adopt laws regulating juvenile detention facilities by may 2007 .
currently , none exist . " this is a huge opportunity for us , people can not look away from this case , " said sonnen , whose group is actively lobbying politicians in charge of creating the new detention center laws . reform , not punish " people tend to say : ' just give them more , longer punishments - they need to feel the full weight of the law , " ' sonnen said .
" but we know that type of treatment just leads to higher recidivism rates . " in fact , he said , juvenile correction facilities are supposed to educate and reform youth , not just punish them . " that 's what is different about youth correction , " he said .
" they are n't incarcerated just in order to pay for a crime , but with the goal of stopping them from committing further crimes .

" the whole starry heaven is involved in the growth of plants , " he wrote back in 1924 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodynamic farming is about respecting nature , with a little bit of the occult thrown in this explains why students in the biodynamics department in ecological agricultural sciences at kassel university have been running a study looking at growth rates of tree ivy according to the phase of the moon . and for those agricultural scientists who are looking for something even more spiritual , they can examine " cosmic influences as conditions for cow breeding " for their phd doctorate under professor ton baars , the department 's head . all in the name of science the german government recently announced an " excellence initiative " to promote scientific research and competition at german universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this germany 's next chance at a nobel prize for science with a bit more effort , perhaps the students at kassel university could be up for some of the millions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- in lucrative research funding up for grabs as part of the initiative . they could start by testing steiner 's belief that the best treatment against a plague of field mice is to scatter their ashes on the field .

german parliamentarians also told the organization it needed to expand its work in asia and the arab world . one of the main vehicles for promoting germany 's culture and language around the world , the goethe institute has been forced to watch its budget drop by 16 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- over the last 10 years and had recently been embroiled in a controversial debate about its future operations . politicians in germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , said friday that a turnaround is at hand , adding that they planned to increase the institute 's finances by 13.5 million euros to a total of about 120 million euros . the added money is planned to enable the organization to expand its network of 144 institutes in 80 countries , members of the committee for foreign culture and education said . there are two tasks that need to be completed for the goethe institute to have positive future , according to social democrat and committee member monika griefahn . expansion ca n't come at european expense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's reading room in north korea " the goethe institute has to show that it is capable of structural change , " she said .
" and we have to bear the new challenges facing us in new regions like eastern europe , asia and the arabic world . " after months of discussion in the committee , several politicians said friday that the institute 's expansion in asian and islamic countries was of particular importance . " the number one task is spreading and fostering of the german language in foreign countries , " said christian democrat peter gauweiler , who co-authored a report with griefahn planning the institute 's future . expansion around the globe can not come at the expense of activities closer to home , as there is still work to do in europe , gauweiler added .
he said goethe officials needed to work more closely with other german institutions abroad , including the german academic exchange service and the humboldt foundation . modernizing administrative practices in addition to teaming up with other german organizations , the foreign cultural policy committee has told the institute it needs to modernize its administrative practices , social democrat lothar mark said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute has offices in 80 countries " the goethe institute has not made any structural adjustments over the past few years , " he said .
" this naturally created a structural deficit . " mark added that the organization needed to set realistic goals based on its budget and consider lowering its costs by moving out of particularly expensive locations in favor of cheaper real estate . germany 's foreign culture flagship german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said he was " very satisfied " with the goethe institute 's work . steinmeier , who said he has a plan of the direction he 'd like the organization to take , has made it a point to visit the institutes in his many trips abroad , registering more goethe visits in his one year in office as germany 's top diplomat than his predecessor , joschka fischer , did during six years in office . " more ambition in foreign schools and more ambition in scientific exchanges , that is what we should deal with over the next years , " said steinmeier , whose ministry is responsible for keeping up foreign political as well as cultural ties .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ? " the question , ' how can something like this happen ? ' is absolutely justified and must be answered , " müller-piepenkötter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention center in siegburg but others are skeptical about the justice minister 's decision to set up a panel to look into the issue . " there is nothing new to learn , " said bernd-rüdiger sonnen , the head of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders -lrb- dvjj -rrb- , an umbrella association advocating the rights of young offenders . " it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .
then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .
" it is tied into the structures , with how people are incarcerated . " avoiding the mob mentality for instance , his group strongly opposes having groups of four people living in one cell as it can lead to a mob mentality where three stronger prisoners gang up on one weak one - as in the case of hermann h. instead , his group advocates a setup in which a group of up to 12 juvenile offenders would each have his or her own room , but would share some common space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire is commonplace at german juvenile halls sonnen sees an upside to the siegburg tragedy : it is a chance for groups like his own to educate the public about the serious need for change in the juvenile court system .
the topic is especially relevant because german states must adopt laws regulating juvenile detention facilities by may 2007 .
currently , none exist . " this is a huge opportunity for us , people can not look away from this case , " said sonnen , whose group is actively lobbying politicians in charge of creating the new detention center laws . reform , not punish " people tend to say : ' just give them more , longer punishments - they need to feel the full weight of the law , " ' sonnen said .
" but we know that type of treatment just leads to higher recidivism rates . " in fact , he said , juvenile correction facilities are supposed to educate and reform youth , not just punish them . " that 's what is different about youth correction , " he said .
" they are n't incarcerated just in order to pay for a crime , but with the goal of stopping them from committing further crimes .

german parliamentarians also told the organization it needed to expand its work in asia and the arab world . one of the main vehicles for promoting germany 's culture and language around the world , the goethe institute has been forced to watch its budget drop by 16 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- over the last 10 years and had recently been embroiled in a controversial debate about its future operations . politicians in germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , said friday that a turnaround is at hand , adding that they planned to increase the institute 's finances by 13.5 million euros to a total of about 120 million euros . the added money is planned to enable the organization to expand its network of 144 institutes in 80 countries , members of the committee for foreign culture and education said . there are two tasks that need to be completed for the goethe institute to have positive future , according to social democrat and committee member monika griefahn . expansion ca n't come at european expense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's reading room in north korea " the goethe institute has to show that it is capable of structural change , " she said .
" and we have to bear the new challenges facing us in new regions like eastern europe , asia and the arabic world . " after months of discussion in the committee , several politicians said friday that the institute 's expansion in asian and islamic countries was of particular importance . " the number one task is spreading and fostering of the german language in foreign countries , " said christian democrat peter gauweiler , who co-authored a report with griefahn planning the institute 's future . expansion around the globe can not come at the expense of activities closer to home , as there is still work to do in europe , gauweiler added .
he said goethe officials needed to work more closely with other german institutions abroad , including the german academic exchange service and the humboldt foundation . modernizing administrative practices in addition to teaming up with other german organizations , the foreign cultural policy committee has told the institute it needs to modernize its administrative practices , social democrat lothar mark said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute has offices in 80 countries " the goethe institute has not made any structural adjustments over the past few years , " he said .
" this naturally created a structural deficit . " mark added that the organization needed to set realistic goals based on its budget and consider lowering its costs by moving out of particularly expensive locations in favor of cheaper real estate . germany 's foreign culture flagship german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said he was " very satisfied " with the goethe institute 's work . steinmeier , who said he has a plan of the direction he 'd like the organization to take , has made it a point to visit the institutes in his many trips abroad , registering more goethe visits in his one year in office as germany 's top diplomat than his predecessor , joschka fischer , did during six years in office . " more ambition in foreign schools and more ambition in scientific exchanges , that is what we should deal with over the next years , " said steinmeier , whose ministry is responsible for keeping up foreign political as well as cultural ties .

afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts . the prices of illicit drugs in the european union keep dropping , in spite of record levels of seizures involving cannabis , heroin , cocaine and amphetamines , in particular the mind-altering drug ecstasy .
the findings were published in a report on thursday by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction . " there are signs in some countries that ecstasy and cocaine are cheaper today than in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " according to the agency 's annual report .
in spite of record levels of drug seizures and successful efforts to stem the flow of cocaine imports from south america , officials at the drug monitoring agency say that they are failing to hit newer routes used by drug traffickers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 1.5 million europeans consume the hard stuff , such as cocaine , regularly an analysis of street prices based on data from 29 countries - the 25 eu members , plus bulgaria , norway , turkey , and romania - showed that average prices for most substances , adjusted for inflation , had fallen from 1999 to 2004 , with the price of ecstasy down by 47 percent , heroin by 45 percent , cocaine by 22 percent and cannabis dropping to 19 percent . although black market prices have dropped significantly , there still remain considerable price differences within europe . the use of cannabis , the plant from which marijuana and hashish are derived , is the most widespread of all illegal drugs , according to the eu study . some 20 percent of the population in europe has tried it at least once , with its use not only confined to young people .
many habitual users continue smoking marijuana or hashish well into their 30s and 40s . " afghans producing heroin like hell " a main source of illicit drugs is afghanistan , according to wolfgang götz , head of the eu drug monitoring center , who said that the afghans were " producing heroin like hell , " with its opium crop supplying 89 percent of europe 's heroin . " the global supply for heroin is now exceeding global demand , " added götz . whether the fall in drug prices reflects changes in supply or demand or both , is unclear , although the agency expressed concern about a rise in illegal drug consumption among juveniles , with the highest rates of abuse among youth in spain , france and britain .
amphetamine and cocaine abuse is highest in britain according to the report , with consumption rising in the entire eu .
some 1.5 million europeans consume these hard drugs regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mind-altering drug ecstasy has become a favorite on the party circuit heroin abuse , on the other hand , has become less widespread , though it remains the most addictive of all illicit drugs and accounts for 60 percent of those who seek help .
to curb the spread of aids and other infectious diseases among drug addicts , most eu countries now offer public programs that distribute sterile needles or replacement drugs to help wean addicts off the most potent substances . according to götz , 1.7 million europeans have drug problems , meaning that they regularly consume hard drugs , much of which is self injected .
on an annual basis , between 7,000 and 8,000 europeans die of drug-related overdoses , mostly from heroin , but also from cocaine , in particular its potent derivative , crack . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life between drugs , work and hierarchy for german prisoners germany 's 200 prisons hold more than 60,000 inmates and a further 14,000 awaiting trials .

his friends accuse the kremlin of poisoning litvinenko to stop his investigation into the unsolved murder of russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya who was shot in moscow in october .
british police have launched an inquiry into what they called the " unexplained death " and have previously said they suspected deliberate poisoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko doctors at london 's university college hospital said they had n't been able to establish what caused the rapid deterioration in litvinenko 's health . litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of russian president vladmir putin , fled russia six years ago and was granted political asylum in britain . the kremlin has denied involvement in litvinenko 's death .
a russian spokesperson said on the sidelines of the eu-russia summit in helsinki that britain must probe the death . " death is always a tragedy , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not up to british officials to investigate the death . putin is expected to face awkward questions over litvinenko 's death at the summit in finland , which holds the current eu presidency . putin is also expected to come under pressure to drop a year-old ban on polish meat and other foodstuffs , which has led poland to veto an eu mandate for negotiations on an eu-russia partnership . eu-russia pact expires next year the eu had hoped to use the helsinki summit to launch talks with russia for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal which expires at the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has massive oil and gas and gas reserves " of course it would be better not to have -lrb- the polish veto -rrb- but we are going to keep on working , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said as he arrived at the summit venue .
" the situation will be overcome . " the planned new partnership deal includes eu demands for better and secure access to russia 's vast oil and gas resources and russian commitments to secure energy supplies into the 25-member bloc - the biggest consumers of russian oil . poland isolating itself germany 's deputy foreign minister , gernot erler , said poland was sidelining itself by refusing to lift its veto on opening the talks . " the warsaw government is not doing itself any favors with this veto , " erler told berlin 's inforadio on friday . " it is isolating poland within the european union . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- middle -rrb- met with finnish president tarja halonen -lrb- left -rrb- on the eve of the summit however , some diplomats have said the eu should have come to the aid of one of its members earlier than one year after a trade embargo was slapped on it . " poland is right to raise the issue , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said earlier this week .
" poland needs support in the trade dispute , and we share their concerns .
russia 's tendency to link trade with politics is not acceptable . " yet the stakes are getting higher in the meat dispute , for russia has announced it could ban animal product imports from the eu in january , when bulgaria and romania join the bloc . " unfortunately , eu members , while adopting the decisions on accession of these countries , did not think it necessary to consult with us on questions that are of interest to all parties , " putin said on thursday in helsinki . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland scuppers eu talks on russia deal poland on monday blocked eu attempts to hold talks with russia over a new cooperation pact , demanding first a clear sign from moscow that its demands on trade and energy will be met .

afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts . the prices of illicit drugs in the european union keep dropping , in spite of record levels of seizures involving cannabis , heroin , cocaine and amphetamines , in particular the mind-altering drug ecstasy .
the findings were published in a report on thursday by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction . " there are signs in some countries that ecstasy and cocaine are cheaper today than in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " according to the agency 's annual report .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ? " the question , ' how can something like this happen ? ' is absolutely justified and must be answered , " müller-piepenkötter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention center in siegburg but others are skeptical about the justice minister 's decision to set up a panel to look into the issue . " there is nothing new to learn , " said bernd-rüdiger sonnen , the head of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders -lrb- dvjj -rrb- , an umbrella association advocating the rights of young offenders . " it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .
then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .
" it is tied into the structures , with how people are incarcerated . " avoiding the mob mentality for instance , his group strongly opposes having groups of four people living in one cell as it can lead to a mob mentality where three stronger prisoners gang up on one weak one - as in the case of hermann h. instead , his group advocates a setup in which a group of up to 12 juvenile offenders would each have his or her own room , but would share some common space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire is commonplace at german juvenile halls sonnen sees an upside to the siegburg tragedy : it is a chance for groups like his own to educate the public about the serious need for change in the juvenile court system .
the topic is especially relevant because german states must adopt laws regulating juvenile detention facilities by may 2007 .
currently , none exist . " this is a huge opportunity for us , people can not look away from this case , " said sonnen , whose group is actively lobbying politicians in charge of creating the new detention center laws . reform , not punish " people tend to say : ' just give them more , longer punishments - they need to feel the full weight of the law , " ' sonnen said .
" but we know that type of treatment just leads to higher recidivism rates . " in fact , he said , juvenile correction facilities are supposed to educate and reform youth , not just punish them . " that 's what is different about youth correction , " he said .
" they are n't incarcerated just in order to pay for a crime , but with the goal of stopping them from committing further crimes . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ?

" it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .
then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .
" it is tied into the structures , with how people are incarcerated .

the topic is especially relevant because german states must adopt laws regulating juvenile detention facilities by may 2007 .
currently , none exist . " this is a huge opportunity for us , people can not look away from this case , " said sonnen , whose group is actively lobbying politicians in charge of creating the new detention center laws . reform , not punish " people tend to say : ' just give them more , longer punishments - they need to feel the full weight of the law , " ' sonnen said .
" but we know that type of treatment just leads to higher recidivism rates . " in fact , he said , juvenile correction facilities are supposed to educate and reform youth , not just punish them . " that 's what is different about youth correction , " he said .

his friends accuse the kremlin of poisoning litvinenko to stop his investigation into the unsolved murder of russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya who was shot in moscow in october .
british police have launched an inquiry into what they called the " unexplained death " and have previously said they suspected deliberate poisoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko doctors at london 's university college hospital said they had n't been able to establish what caused the rapid deterioration in litvinenko 's health . litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of russian president vladmir putin , fled russia six years ago and was granted political asylum in britain . the kremlin has denied involvement in litvinenko 's death .
a russian spokesperson said on the sidelines of the eu-russia summit in helsinki that britain must probe the death . " death is always a tragedy , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not up to british officials to investigate the death . putin is expected to face awkward questions over litvinenko 's death at the summit in finland , which holds the current eu presidency . putin is also expected to come under pressure to drop a year-old ban on polish meat and other foodstuffs , which has led poland to veto an eu mandate for negotiations on an eu-russia partnership . eu-russia pact expires next year the eu had hoped to use the helsinki summit to launch talks with russia for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal which expires at the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has massive oil and gas and gas reserves " of course it would be better not to have -lrb- the polish veto -rrb- but we are going to keep on working , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said as he arrived at the summit venue .
" the situation will be overcome . " the planned new partnership deal includes eu demands for better and secure access to russia 's vast oil and gas resources and russian commitments to secure energy supplies into the 25-member bloc - the biggest consumers of russian oil . poland isolating itself germany 's deputy foreign minister , gernot erler , said poland was sidelining itself by refusing to lift its veto on opening the talks .

" poland needs support in the trade dispute , and we share their concerns .
russia 's tendency to link trade with politics is not acceptable . " yet the stakes are getting higher in the meat dispute , for russia has announced it could ban animal product imports from the eu in january , when bulgaria and romania join the bloc .

german parliamentarians also told the organization it needed to expand its work in asia and the arab world . one of the main vehicles for promoting germany 's culture and language around the world , the goethe institute has been forced to watch its budget drop by 16 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- over the last 10 years and had recently been embroiled in a controversial debate about its future operations . politicians in germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , said friday that a turnaround is at hand , adding that they planned to increase the institute 's finances by 13.5 million euros to a total of about 120 million euros . the added money is planned to enable the organization to expand its network of 144 institutes in 80 countries , members of the committee for foreign culture and education said . there are two tasks that need to be completed for the goethe institute to have positive future , according to social democrat and committee member monika griefahn . expansion ca n't come at european expense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's reading room in north korea " the goethe institute has to show that it is capable of structural change , " she said .
" and we have to bear the new challenges facing us in new regions like eastern europe , asia and the arabic world . " after months of discussion in the committee , several politicians said friday that the institute 's expansion in asian and islamic countries was of particular importance . " the number one task is spreading and fostering of the german language in foreign countries , " said christian democrat peter gauweiler , who co-authored a report with griefahn planning the institute 's future . expansion around the globe can not come at the expense of activities closer to home , as there is still work to do in europe , gauweiler added .
he said goethe officials needed to work more closely with other german institutions abroad , including the german academic exchange service and the humboldt foundation . modernizing administrative practices in addition to teaming up with other german organizations , the foreign cultural policy committee has told the institute it needs to modernize its administrative practices , social democrat lothar mark said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute has offices in 80 countries " the goethe institute has not made any structural adjustments over the past few years , " he said .
" this naturally created a structural deficit . " mark added that the organization needed to set realistic goals based on its budget and consider lowering its costs by moving out of particularly expensive locations in favor of cheaper real estate . germany 's foreign culture flagship german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said he was " very satisfied " with the goethe institute 's work . steinmeier , who said he has a plan of the direction he 'd like the organization to take , has made it a point to visit the institutes in his many trips abroad , registering more goethe visits in his one year in office as germany 's top diplomat than his predecessor , joschka fischer , did during six years in office . " more ambition in foreign schools and more ambition in scientific exchanges , that is what we should deal with over the next years , " said steinmeier , whose ministry is responsible for keeping up foreign political as well as cultural ties .

his friends accuse the kremlin of poisoning litvinenko to stop his investigation into the unsolved murder of russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya who was shot in moscow in october .
british police have launched an inquiry into what they called the " unexplained death " and have previously said they suspected deliberate poisoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko doctors at london 's university college hospital said they had n't been able to establish what caused the rapid deterioration in litvinenko 's health . litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of russian president vladmir putin , fled russia six years ago and was granted political asylum in britain . the kremlin has denied involvement in litvinenko 's death .

german parliamentarians also told the organization it needed to expand its work in asia and the arab world . one of the main vehicles for promoting germany 's culture and language around the world , the goethe institute has been forced to watch its budget drop by 16 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- over the last 10 years and had recently been embroiled in a controversial debate about its future operations . politicians in germany 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats , however , said friday that a turnaround is at hand , adding that they planned to increase the institute 's finances by 13.5 million euros to a total of about 120 million euros . the added money is planned to enable the organization to expand its network of 144 institutes in 80 countries , members of the committee for foreign culture and education said . there are two tasks that need to be completed for the goethe institute to have positive future , according to social democrat and committee member monika griefahn . expansion ca n't come at european expense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's reading room in north korea " the goethe institute has to show that it is capable of structural change , " she said .
" and we have to bear the new challenges facing us in new regions like eastern europe , asia and the arabic world . " after months of discussion in the committee , several politicians said friday that the institute 's expansion in asian and islamic countries was of particular importance . " the number one task is spreading and fostering of the german language in foreign countries , " said christian democrat peter gauweiler , who co-authored a report with griefahn planning the institute 's future . expansion around the globe can not come at the expense of activities closer to home , as there is still work to do in europe , gauweiler added .
he said goethe officials needed to work more closely with other german institutions abroad , including the german academic exchange service and the humboldt foundation . modernizing administrative practices in addition to teaming up with other german organizations , the foreign cultural policy committee has told the institute it needs to modernize its administrative practices , social democrat lothar mark said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute has offices in 80 countries " the goethe institute has not made any structural adjustments over the past few years , " he said .
" this naturally created a structural deficit . " mark added that the organization needed to set realistic goals based on its budget and consider lowering its costs by moving out of particularly expensive locations in favor of cheaper real estate . germany 's foreign culture flagship german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said he was " very satisfied " with the goethe institute 's work . steinmeier , who said he has a plan of the direction he 'd like the organization to take , has made it a point to visit the institutes in his many trips abroad , registering more goethe visits in his one year in office as germany 's top diplomat than his predecessor , joschka fischer , did during six years in office . " more ambition in foreign schools and more ambition in scientific exchanges , that is what we should deal with over the next years , " said steinmeier , whose ministry is responsible for keeping up foreign political as well as cultural ties .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ? " the question , ' how can something like this happen ? ' is absolutely justified and must be answered , " müller-piepenkötter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention center in siegburg but others are skeptical about the justice minister 's decision to set up a panel to look into the issue . " there is nothing new to learn , " said bernd-rüdiger sonnen , the head of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders -lrb- dvjj -rrb- , an umbrella association advocating the rights of young offenders . " it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .
then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .
" it is tied into the structures , with how people are incarcerated . " avoiding the mob mentality for instance , his group strongly opposes having groups of four people living in one cell as it can lead to a mob mentality where three stronger prisoners gang up on one weak one - as in the case of hermann h. instead , his group advocates a setup in which a group of up to 12 juvenile offenders would each have his or her own room , but would share some common space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire is commonplace at german juvenile halls sonnen sees an upside to the siegburg tragedy : it is a chance for groups like his own to educate the public about the serious need for change in the juvenile court system .
the topic is especially relevant because german states must adopt laws regulating juvenile detention facilities by may 2007 .
currently , none exist . " this is a huge opportunity for us , people can not look away from this case , " said sonnen , whose group is actively lobbying politicians in charge of creating the new detention center laws . reform , not punish " people tend to say : ' just give them more , longer punishments - they need to feel the full weight of the law , " ' sonnen said .
" but we know that type of treatment just leads to higher recidivism rates . " in fact , he said , juvenile correction facilities are supposed to educate and reform youth , not just punish them . " that 's what is different about youth correction , " he said .
" they are n't incarcerated just in order to pay for a crime , but with the goal of stopping them from committing further crimes .

" death is always a tragedy , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not up to british officials to investigate the death . putin is expected to face awkward questions over litvinenko 's death at the summit in finland , which holds the current eu presidency . putin is also expected to come under pressure to drop a year-old ban on polish meat and other foodstuffs , which has led poland to veto an eu mandate for negotiations on an eu-russia partnership . eu-russia pact expires next year the eu had hoped to use the helsinki summit to launch talks with russia for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal which expires at the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has massive oil and gas and gas reserves " of course it would be better not to have -lrb- the polish veto -rrb- but we are going to keep on working , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said as he arrived at the summit venue .
" the situation will be overcome . " the planned new partnership deal includes eu demands for better and secure access to russia 's vast oil and gas resources and russian commitments to secure energy supplies into the 25-member bloc - the biggest consumers of russian oil . poland isolating itself germany 's deputy foreign minister , gernot erler , said poland was sidelining itself by refusing to lift its veto on opening the talks . " the warsaw government is not doing itself any favors with this veto , " erler told berlin 's inforadio on friday . " it is isolating poland within the european union . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- middle -rrb- met with finnish president tarja halonen -lrb- left -rrb- on the eve of the summit however , some diplomats have said the eu should have come to the aid of one of its members earlier than one year after a trade embargo was slapped on it . " poland is right to raise the issue , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said earlier this week .
" poland needs support in the trade dispute , and we share their concerns .
russia 's tendency to link trade with politics is not acceptable . " yet the stakes are getting higher in the meat dispute , for russia has announced it could ban animal product imports from the eu in january , when bulgaria and romania join the bloc . " unfortunately , eu members , while adopting the decisions on accession of these countries , did not think it necessary to consult with us on questions that are of interest to all parties , " putin said on thursday in helsinki . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland scuppers eu talks on russia deal poland on monday blocked eu attempts to hold talks with russia over a new cooperation pact , demanding first a clear sign from moscow that its demands on trade and energy will be met .

his friends accuse the kremlin of poisoning litvinenko to stop his investigation into the unsolved murder of russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya who was shot in moscow in october .
british police have launched an inquiry into what they called the " unexplained death " and have previously said they suspected deliberate poisoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko doctors at london 's university college hospital said they had n't been able to establish what caused the rapid deterioration in litvinenko 's health . litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of russian president vladmir putin , fled russia six years ago and was granted political asylum in britain . the kremlin has denied involvement in litvinenko 's death .
a russian spokesperson said on the sidelines of the eu-russia summit in helsinki that britain must probe the death .

his friends accuse the kremlin of poisoning litvinenko to stop his investigation into the unsolved murder of russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya who was shot in moscow in october .
british police have launched an inquiry into what they called the " unexplained death " and have previously said they suspected deliberate poisoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko doctors at london 's university college hospital said they had n't been able to establish what caused the rapid deterioration in litvinenko 's health . litvinenko , who was an outspoken critic of russian president vladmir putin , fled russia six years ago and was granted political asylum in britain . the kremlin has denied involvement in litvinenko 's death .
a russian spokesperson said on the sidelines of the eu-russia summit in helsinki that britain must probe the death . " death is always a tragedy , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not up to british officials to investigate the death . putin is expected to face awkward questions over litvinenko 's death at the summit in finland , which holds the current eu presidency . putin is also expected to come under pressure to drop a year-old ban on polish meat and other foodstuffs , which has led poland to veto an eu mandate for negotiations on an eu-russia partnership . eu-russia pact expires next year the eu had hoped to use the helsinki summit to launch talks with russia for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to replace a 1997 deal which expires at the end of next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has massive oil and gas and gas reserves " of course it would be better not to have -lrb- the polish veto -rrb- but we are going to keep on working , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said as he arrived at the summit venue .
" the situation will be overcome . " the planned new partnership deal includes eu demands for better and secure access to russia 's vast oil and gas resources and russian commitments to secure energy supplies into the 25-member bloc - the biggest consumers of russian oil . poland isolating itself germany 's deputy foreign minister , gernot erler , said poland was sidelining itself by refusing to lift its veto on opening the talks . " the warsaw government is not doing itself any favors with this veto , " erler told berlin 's inforadio on friday . " it is isolating poland within the european union . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- middle -rrb- met with finnish president tarja halonen -lrb- left -rrb- on the eve of the summit however , some diplomats have said the eu should have come to the aid of one of its members earlier than one year after a trade embargo was slapped on it . " poland is right to raise the issue , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said earlier this week .
" poland needs support in the trade dispute , and we share their concerns .
russia 's tendency to link trade with politics is not acceptable . " yet the stakes are getting higher in the meat dispute , for russia has announced it could ban animal product imports from the eu in january , when bulgaria and romania join the bloc . " unfortunately , eu members , while adopting the decisions on accession of these countries , did not think it necessary to consult with us on questions that are of interest to all parties , " putin said on thursday in helsinki . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland scuppers eu talks on russia deal poland on monday blocked eu attempts to hold talks with russia over a new cooperation pact , demanding first a clear sign from moscow that its demands on trade and energy will be met .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ?

then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .

afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts . the prices of illicit drugs in the european union keep dropping , in spite of record levels of seizures involving cannabis , heroin , cocaine and amphetamines , in particular the mind-altering drug ecstasy .
the findings were published in a report on thursday by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction . " there are signs in some countries that ecstasy and cocaine are cheaper today than in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " according to the agency 's annual report .
in spite of record levels of drug seizures and successful efforts to stem the flow of cocaine imports from south america , officials at the drug monitoring agency say that they are failing to hit newer routes used by drug traffickers .

many habitual users continue smoking marijuana or hashish well into their 30s and 40s . " afghans producing heroin like hell " a main source of illicit drugs is afghanistan , according to wolfgang götz , head of the eu drug monitoring center , who said that the afghans were " producing heroin like hell , " with its opium crop supplying 89 percent of europe 's heroin . " the global supply for heroin is now exceeding global demand , " added götz . whether the fall in drug prices reflects changes in supply or demand or both , is unclear , although the agency expressed concern about a rise in illegal drug consumption among juveniles , with the highest rates of abuse among youth in spain , france and britain .
amphetamine and cocaine abuse is highest in britain according to the report , with consumption rising in the entire eu .

to curb the spread of aids and other infectious diseases among drug addicts , most eu countries now offer public programs that distribute sterile needles or replacement drugs to help wean addicts off the most potent substances . according to götz , 1.7 million europeans have drug problems , meaning that they regularly consume hard drugs , much of which is self injected .

juvenile detention is up for revision , critics say is the german juvenile justice system doing its job ?
a torture scandal that ended in death has unleashed a flurry of soul-searching and recriminations among justice officials . the brutal killing of an inmate earlier this month in a german juvenile detention hall has prison reform advocates demanding sweeping change , and a top politician trying to sidestep growing public ire . much of the uproar turns on the case of a juvenile detainee named hermann h. on nov .
11 , the 20-year-old was found dead in his four-man cell at a correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates . a lawsuit has been brought against the cellmates , three youths between the ages of 17 and 20 who have confessed to the acts .
another may be started against prison personnel ; guards at the scene failed to notice anything awry despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours . second case reported as if that was n't enough , on thursday , newspapers reported that earlier this summer , another detainee in the same facility was taunted , harassed , and forced to slit his own wrists by a cellmate .
that case did n't end in death , because the inmate was found immediately and his wounds were successfully treated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw justice minister müller-piepenkötter has appointed an " expert panel " critics complained that north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter was too slow to react to the situation , waiting a full week before she suspended the director of the siegburg institution .
they also fault her for a comment she made denying personal responsibility for the situation . since then , however , müller-piepenkötter has announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . political strategizing ? " the question , ' how can something like this happen ? ' is absolutely justified and must be answered , " müller-piepenkötter said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention center in siegburg but others are skeptical about the justice minister 's decision to set up a panel to look into the issue . " there is nothing new to learn , " said bernd-rüdiger sonnen , the head of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders -lrb- dvjj -rrb- , an umbrella association advocating the rights of young offenders . " it 's a strategy politicians use ; they form a committee and wait until people forget about the issue .
then they think the job is done . " and this is not the first case of an inmate being killed in a juvenile hall in germany , sonnen said . " it does n't happen often , but these closed institutions are anything but free of violence , " he said .
" it is tied into the structures , with how people are incarcerated . " avoiding the mob mentality for instance , his group strongly opposes having groups of four people living in one cell as it can lead to a mob mentality where three stronger prisoners gang up on one weak one - as in the case of hermann h. instead , his group advocates a setup in which a group of up to 12 juvenile offenders would each have his or her own room , but would share some common space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbed wire is commonplace at german juvenile halls sonnen sees an upside to the siegburg tragedy : it is a chance for groups like his own to educate the public about the serious need for change in the juvenile court system .
the topic is especially relevant because german states must adopt laws regulating juvenile detention facilities by may 2007 .
currently , none exist . " this is a huge opportunity for us , people can not look away from this case , " said sonnen , whose group is actively lobbying politicians in charge of creating the new detention center laws . reform , not punish " people tend to say : ' just give them more , longer punishments - they need to feel the full weight of the law , " ' sonnen said .
" but we know that type of treatment just leads to higher recidivism rates . " in fact , he said , juvenile correction facilities are supposed to educate and reform youth , not just punish them . " that 's what is different about youth correction , " he said .
" they are n't incarcerated just in order to pay for a crime , but with the goal of stopping them from committing further crimes .

afghanistan remains a prime source for europe 's heroin addicts . the prices of illicit drugs in the european union keep dropping , in spite of record levels of seizures involving cannabis , heroin , cocaine and amphetamines , in particular the mind-altering drug ecstasy .
the findings were published in a report on thursday by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction . " there are signs in some countries that ecstasy and cocaine are cheaper today than in the late 1980s and early 1990s , " according to the agency 's annual report .
in spite of record levels of drug seizures and successful efforts to stem the flow of cocaine imports from south america , officials at the drug monitoring agency say that they are failing to hit newer routes used by drug traffickers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 1.5 million europeans consume the hard stuff , such as cocaine , regularly an analysis of street prices based on data from 29 countries - the 25 eu members , plus bulgaria , norway , turkey , and romania - showed that average prices for most substances , adjusted for inflation , had fallen from 1999 to 2004 , with the price of ecstasy down by 47 percent , heroin by 45 percent , cocaine by 22 percent and cannabis dropping to 19 percent . although black market prices have dropped significantly , there still remain considerable price differences within europe . the use of cannabis , the plant from which marijuana and hashish are derived , is the most widespread of all illegal drugs , according to the eu study . some 20 percent of the population in europe has tried it at least once , with its use not only confined to young people .
many habitual users continue smoking marijuana or hashish well into their 30s and 40s . " afghans producing heroin like hell " a main source of illicit drugs is afghanistan , according to wolfgang götz , head of the eu drug monitoring center , who said that the afghans were " producing heroin like hell , " with its opium crop supplying 89 percent of europe 's heroin . " the global supply for heroin is now exceeding global demand , " added götz . whether the fall in drug prices reflects changes in supply or demand or both , is unclear , although the agency expressed concern about a rise in illegal drug consumption among juveniles , with the highest rates of abuse among youth in spain , france and britain .
amphetamine and cocaine abuse is highest in britain according to the report , with consumption rising in the entire eu .
some 1.5 million europeans consume these hard drugs regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mind-altering drug ecstasy has become a favorite on the party circuit heroin abuse , on the other hand , has become less widespread , though it remains the most addictive of all illicit drugs and accounts for 60 percent of those who seek help .
to curb the spread of aids and other infectious diseases among drug addicts , most eu countries now offer public programs that distribute sterile needles or replacement drugs to help wean addicts off the most potent substances . according to götz , 1.7 million europeans have drug problems , meaning that they regularly consume hard drugs , much of which is self injected .
on an annual basis , between 7,000 and 8,000 europeans die of drug-related overdoses , mostly from heroin , but also from cocaine , in particular its potent derivative , crack . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life between drugs , work and hierarchy for german prisoners germany 's 200 prisons hold more than 60,000 inmates and a further 14,000 awaiting trials .

taiwan 's opposition was hoping to get enough votes to force a referendum on the future of the embattled leader .
but ruling party members showed their support for mr chen by boycotting the vote , preventing the bill from getting the two-thirds majority needed to pass .
mr chen has been under pressure in recent months because of a series of alleged corruption scandals .
his wife , wu shu-chen , and three former aides have been indicted by taiwanese prosecutors on the misuse of state funds .
mr chen himself can not be prosecuted while in office , as he is protected by presidential immunity .
keeping up the pressure the opposition parties , which have a small majority in parliament , needed at least 14 ruling party members to back the recall motion in order for it to succeed .
scandal timeline march 2004 : president chen narrowly wins re-election may 2006 : president 's son-in-law held over insider trading claims charged in july allegations of improper conduct involving chen 's wife and senior aides also surface june : chen cedes some powers to pm amid outcry unprecedented opposition motion to oust him , which fails september : two weeks of pro and anti-chen marches opposition launch new bid to recall chen , which again fails october : wu shu-chen cleared of accepting shop vouchers in return for influence november : wu shu-chen charged with corruption over handling of secret presidential funds prosecutors say enough evidence to indict chen , but he is protected by presidential immunity testing times for taiwan but , as was the case in the last two attempts to oust mr chen - in june and october - all mr chen 's democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- colleagues stood by him and the vote failed .
a total of 118 legislators voted in favour of the recall motion - well short of the 146 needed for it to pass .
when this third motion was originally tabled , there had been speculation that some dpp members - as well as legislators from smaller parties allied to the dpp - would drop their support for mr chen in the light of prosecutors ' claims that they have enough evidence to charge him with corruption .
but as the vote drew near , correspondents say it grew increasingly apparent that dpp members would remain loyal to their president .
in fact many taiwanese had questioned the decision to hold the vote , given its widely predicted outcome , according to the bbc correspondent in taipei , caroline gluck .
pressure on president chen to resign has also eased in recent weeks , our correspondent says .
ma ying-jeou , chairman of the main opposition party , the kuomintang , has faced allegations of misusing his special mayoral allowance .
prosecutors are also looking into the use of public funds by many other senior government officials .
nevertheless , president chen 's political troubles are far from over , our correspondent says .
crucial mayoral and local government elections early next month in taiwan 's largest cities , taipei and kaohsiung , will be a key test of public opinion towards the president and his party .
heavy losses for the governing party could force open internal party splits , and increase pressure on the leadership to clearly distance itself from the president .

taiwan 's opposition was hoping to get enough votes to force a referendum on the future of the embattled leader .
but ruling party members showed their support for mr chen by boycotting the vote , preventing the bill from getting the two-thirds majority needed to pass .
mr chen has been under pressure in recent months because of a series of alleged corruption scandals .
his wife , wu shu-chen , and three former aides have been indicted by taiwanese prosecutors on the misuse of state funds .
mr chen himself can not be prosecuted while in office , as he is protected by presidential immunity .
keeping up the pressure the opposition parties , which have a small majority in parliament , needed at least 14 ruling party members to back the recall motion in order for it to succeed .
scandal timeline march 2004 : president chen narrowly wins re-election may 2006 : president 's son-in-law held over insider trading claims charged in july allegations of improper conduct involving chen 's wife and senior aides also surface june : chen cedes some powers to pm amid outcry unprecedented opposition motion to oust him , which fails september : two weeks of pro and anti-chen marches opposition launch new bid to recall chen , which again fails october : wu shu-chen cleared of accepting shop vouchers in return for influence november : wu shu-chen charged with corruption over handling of secret presidential funds prosecutors say enough evidence to indict chen , but he is protected by presidential immunity testing times for taiwan but , as was the case in the last two attempts to oust mr chen - in june and october - all mr chen 's democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- colleagues stood by him and the vote failed .
a total of 118 legislators voted in favour of the recall motion - well short of the 146 needed for it to pass .
when this third motion was originally tabled , there had been speculation that some dpp members - as well as legislators from smaller parties allied to the dpp - would drop their support for mr chen in the light of prosecutors ' claims that they have enough evidence to charge him with corruption .
but as the vote drew near , correspondents say it grew increasingly apparent that dpp members would remain loyal to their president .
in fact many taiwanese had questioned the decision to hold the vote , given its widely predicted outcome , according to the bbc correspondent in taipei , caroline gluck .
pressure on president chen to resign has also eased in recent weeks , our correspondent says .
ma ying-jeou , chairman of the main opposition party , the kuomintang , has faced allegations of misusing his special mayoral allowance .
prosecutors are also looking into the use of public funds by many other senior government officials .
nevertheless , president chen 's political troubles are far from over , our correspondent says .

a year ago the licensing act , allowing premises to apply for longer opening hours , raised fears of increased binge drinking and trouble on the streets .
but both north wales police and gwent police said disorder has not increased .
health officials also said the law has had " little impact " on hospital accident and emergency departments .
laws allowing pubs , clubs and shops in wales and england to sell alcohol for longer if they gained a licence were introduced on 24 november , 2005 . "
i was one of many with the apprehension that we would be inundated - happily it did not happen " aruni sen , wrexham maelor hospital almost 5,000 licence extensions were granted in wales .
but just 60 premises , most of them supermarkets , were granted 24-hour licences .
the changes also handed police extra powers to tackle drink-related problems and to close nuisance premises .
some police forces , including the metropolitan police , expressed concern resources would be " stretched " , particularly in the early hours of the morning .
parts of the licensing act were opposed by the conservatives with some labour mps also voting against its implementation .
but one year on , two of wales ' four police forces and two nhs trusts have said the impact of extended hours has been less than was feared .
a spokesperson for gwent police said : " the anniversary of the implementation of the licensing act has not produced the negative impact on our communities that was feared .
" the extended time available for customers to disperse has proved the best asset and eased the pressures and conflicts that previously arose when large groups of people hit the streets at the same time . "
north wales police said it was " still far too early " to judge whether the new laws had been a success , adding they were comparing statistics with the previous 12 months .
but the force said that " initial anecdotal evidence " from officers indicated the dispersal of people from pubs and clubs had been spread over a longer time period .
deputy chief constable clive wolfendale said : " the figures are showing around a 2 % fall in alcohol-related disorder - however , it is too early to confirm if this is a trend .
" the biggest impact is that it is now much busier in the small hours , creating a new and significant challenge for us in relation to how we deploy resources . "
' assaults reduced ' two of wales ' nhs trusts said there had been little impact on their accident and emergency departments as a result of the changes .
michael mccabe , clinical director of a & e services at swansea nhs trust , said : " we have n't noticed any adverse changes as a result of the new drinking laws .
" we think the serious incidents in the city like glassings and serious assaults have reduced .
" the licensing regulations also give the police much greater powers .
they can monitor licensed premises , and that is having an impact too . "
north east wales nhs trust said it did not " see any more drunk patients than before " .
aruni sen , consultant in emergency medicine wrexham maelor hospital , said : " in the last 12 months , this extended hour rule has made very little , if any , impact on our departmental activity .

a year ago the licensing act , allowing premises to apply for longer opening hours , raised fears of increased binge drinking and trouble on the streets .
but both north wales police and gwent police said disorder has not increased .
health officials also said the law has had " little impact " on hospital accident and emergency departments .
laws allowing pubs , clubs and shops in wales and england to sell alcohol for longer if they gained a licence were introduced on 24 november , 2005 .
i was one of many with the apprehension that we would be inundated - happily it did not happen aruni sen , wrexham maelor hospital almost 5,000 licence extensions were granted in wales .
but just 60 premises , most of them supermarkets , were granted 24-hour licences .
the changes also handed police extra powers to tackle drink-related problems and to close nuisance premises .
some police forces , including the metropolitan police , expressed concern resources would be " stretched " , particularly in the early hours of the morning .
parts of the licensing act were opposed by the conservatives with some labour mps also voting against its implementation .
but one year on , two of wales ' four police forces and two nhs trusts have said the impact of extended hours has been less than was feared .
there were fears over increased disorder with longer hours a spokesperson for gwent police said : " the anniversary of the implementation of the licensing act has not produced the negative impact on our communities that was feared .
" the extended time available for customers to disperse has proved the best asset and eased the pressures and conflicts that previously arose when large groups of people hit the streets at the same time . "
north wales police said it was " still far too early " to judge whether the new laws had been a success , adding they were comparing statistics with the previous 12 months .
but the force said that " initial anecdotal evidence " from officers indicated the dispersal of people from pubs and clubs had been spread over a longer time period .
deputy chief constable clive wolfendale said : " the figures are showing around a 2 % fall in alcohol-related disorder - however , it is too early to confirm if this is a trend .
" the biggest impact is that it is now much busier in the small hours , creating a new and significant challenge for us in relation to how we deploy resources . "
' assaults reduced ' two of wales ' nhs trusts said there had been little impact on their accident and emergency departments as a result of the changes .
michael mccabe , clinical director of a & e services at swansea nhs trust , said : " we have n't noticed any adverse changes as a result of the new drinking laws .
" we think the serious incidents in the city like glassings and serious assaults have reduced .
" the licensing regulations also give the police much greater powers .
they can monitor licensed premises , and that is having an impact too . "
north east wales nhs trust said it did not " see any more drunk patients than before " .
aruni sen , consultant in emergency medicine wrexham maelor hospital , said : " in the last 12 months , this extended hour rule has made very little , if any , impact on our departmental activity .
" i was one of many with the apprehension that we would be inundated - happily it did not happen . "

the australian wheat board -lrb- awb -rrb- is accused of paying $ 220m in kickbacks to the former iraqi president .
the findings are not expected to be made public until it is presented to parliament early next week .
but newspapers report the government is expected to be cleared of wrongdoing .
however , the inquiry will recommend criminal charges be brought against a number of executives , the reports add .
the awb was the largest single supplier of humanitarian goods under the un 's oil-for-food programme .
the scandal-ridden programme ran in iraq from 1996 to 2003 .
opposition politicians in australia have described the awb affair as the country 's " biggest-ever " corruption scandal .
kickbacks denied the wheat exporter is accused of paying bribes to saddam hussein to secure contracts worth more than $ 2bn under the un 's oil-for-food programme .
the commission , headed by retired judge terence cole , has heard more than 70 days of evidence in sydney in considering whether the awb broke any australian laws in its dealings in iraq .
among the witnesses were prime minister john howard and his foreign and trade ministers .
they have denied knowing that kickbacks were being paid to the former iraqi leader .
dr andrew vincent from macquarie university says the investigation into the awb has made life uncomfortable for the prime minister .
" it did seem to reveal that either the government did n't know what was happening , " he said , " in which case the government was incompetent .
" or the government did know what was happening - in which case the government was colluding with an illegal act . "

robert opie can not .
since he started collecting wrappers and packaging in 1963 , he has forced himself to taste such questionable innovations as christmas pudding flavour kit kats and ovaltine 's instant omelette .
" having paid some horrendous sum of money , you feel obliged to at least try it , " he says .
" i did taste a can of corned beef once that was at least 50 years old .
" it tasted a little soapy , but was still fit for human consumption . "
a small proportion of mr opie 's collection has now been put together to make the museum of brands , packaging and advertising in london 's notting hill .
new brands it is a tribute to what might happen if you never throw anything away .
top 10 grocery products / years 1 .
coca cola - 106 2 .

kingsmill - 16 9 .
robinsons - 69 10 .
lucozade - 77 source : acnielsen the museum groups exhibits by era and then shows how the packaging of individual products have developed over time .
mr opie 's historical gems range from chocolate left over from the boer war -lrb- which even he has not tasted -rrb- to a selection of spin-off board games from 1980s television shows such as jim 'll fix it .
unlike mr opie , most people appear a great deal less willing to try something new .
indeed , the top 10 branded items bought in uk grocers have been around , on average , for 70 years .
only two of them are are younger than 50 years and only three have been introduced since the end of world war ii .
mr opie is not surprised that the top brands are so old .
" there 's an advantage to being first on the market , " he says .
" but it 's not easy staying at the top .
" there 's a conundrum for a brand with trying to maintain your heritage status without seeming old-fashioned . "
and it is not all about trying to appear up-to-date .
companies bring out their best-selling brands in different forms .
yet , the greatest risks come for those who introduce entirely new brands .
" we estimate that three out of four new brands launched in the uk fail , " observes jasmine montgomery from the consultants futurebrands .
" so , of course , many companies are looking at how to try and minimise that risk . "
one way to minimise the risk is to be creative with existing brands instead of introducing new ones .
" the reason that these brands have been around so long is because they have innovated , " says ms montgomery .
" they 've kept up with the times , they 've brought out the new flavour variants , the new packaging and the new retail channel innovations . "
that 's how we ended up with squeezy marmite , green ketchup and maltesers chocolate malt drink .
stretching the brands yet making changes to an existing brand is far from risk-free .
" kit kat have been trying too hard , " according to mr opie .
" they 've been bringing out varieties to try to gain shelf space , but it may damage the brand , " he adds , pointing to the " repellent " christmas pudding-flavoured kit kat as an example of the brand being stretched too far .
another classic that has seen some fundamental tampering is marmite , which has recently brought out its squeezy bottle .
unilever , which makes marmite , says that people kept e-mailing the company and suggesting it , but marmite customers are notoriously conservative .
apparently , when the metal top to the jar was abandoned in favour of a plastic one in 1983 , some people decanted their new marmite into the old jars .
some enthusiasts certainly think the thinner product in the squeezy jars is " just wrong " .
marmite 's recent marketing has been built on inspiring strong opinions , so such responses might be both expected and desirable .
perishable packaging all is not lost for new brands , though .
many retailers are keen to sell local products .
they may not show up on the national statistics , but can still make an impact .
" we 've certainly seen -lsb- successful -rsb- local products , like in the lake district where a local ice cream outsells haagen dazs , " says judi bevan , author of trolley war .
" local products can do very very well , " she says , insisting that supermarkets are generally keen to adopt products that have proven themselves .
if a product ends up on the supermarket shelves , you can be sure mr opie will be dashing out to buy it - particularly to get his hands on the packaging .
this man , who can start a sentence with " it was only the other day when i was looking through my collection of dettol bottles " , is currently wrestling with the problem of how to preserve examples of the new sainsbury 's organic produce packaging , which biodegrades as fast as a banana skin .

by ian pollock personal finance reporter , bbc news people in the uk seem to be obsessed with property - buying it , doing it up and selling it .
the national obsession with rising house prices generates big headlines look at our fascination with house prices , now measured by at least ten different house price surveys every month .
gawp at the never ending stream of tv programmes about diy , interior decoration , buying a home abroad or making money through outright property speculation .
browse the regular exhibitions aimed at promoting the virtues of buying a house in the latest foreign hotspot , whether it be croatia or romania .
or you can grit your teeth as you hear people just a few years older than yourself reveal how little they paid for their house just five or ten years ago .
there is no doubt about it .
the uk is a nation of homeowners , rather than napoleon 's fabled shop keepers .
more households our national obsession is unlikely to fade .
we are going to see a big increase in the number of smaller , older , households over the next 10 to 20 years prof michael ball even more people will want a home in the coming years .
the population of the uk is predicted to rise from 60 million in 2005 , to 62 million in 2011 , and nearly 65 million by 2021 .
more importantly , the number of households , which is the key determinant of how many homes will be needed , is also going to rise sharply as well .
there are currently 22.8 million households in great britain .
the department for communities & local government -lrb- dclg -rrb- predicts that another million or so will be added in the next five years alone .
and by 2016 there will be 25.1 million households in britain - an increase of 2.3 million in just ten years .
a lot of attention has been given to the fact that the country has seen a surge in immigration recently , principally from eastern europe .
but professor michael ball , of the university of reading business school , said the rise in household numbers will be driven by a large increase in the number of us who are living alone .
" the big driver at the moment is actually the ageing society .
" at the same time general household size is getting smaller , so we are going to see a big increase in the number of smaller , older , households over the next 10 to 20 years , " said professor ball .
the size of the average english household has already fallen steadily from 3.1 in 1961 to 2.29 today .
the dclg predicts that in the next 15 years that will fall even further , to just 2.21 .
not enough houses one of the main reasons why house prices have been so buoyant for the last ten years is that the country has simply not been building enough to meet the demand for houses to buy or rent .
the smallest flat in the uk - a former storage cupboard in notting hill " we estimate that the number of households has been growing at 200,000 or even more each year in recent years , " said milan katri , chief economist of the royal institution of chartered surveyors .
" yet new building has been running at between 140,000 and 160,000 a year , " he added .
thanks to successive government policies , hardly any new council houses have been built for the last 20 years .
some people who might once have rented have been more or less forced to buy instead .
tony key , professor of real estate economics at the cass business school in london , said this under supply of housing has led to a huge distortion in the uk property market .
" somewhere around the mid 1980s we stopped building council houses and we did n't fill in the gap .
" there 's been a group of people who might logically be renters who have been forced into being owner occupiers , " said professor key .
meanwhile millions of former council homes have also been sold by local authorities .
the conventional wisdom the combined effects of rampant house price inflation , a lack of good quality , cheap , rented property , and windfalls gains for home owners have left a deep psychological imprint on the uk public .
a really strong component of demand is speculative , taking advantage of what you think is happening in the market , and the fear factor saxon brettell , cambridge econometrics saxon brettell , of the consultancy cambridge econometrics , said a fear of being left behind and a desire to cash in on windfall gains , are big forces driving demand .
" the long run forces are the need for shelter and accommodation , and allowing people to live in the location where they want to .
" but if you did n't believe that you had to get onto the housing ladder as quickly as possible as a young person , we would n't have this stressful activity with the search for early ownership , early on in their careers , especially in the south of england , " he pointed out .
despite the house price crash of the early 1990s , many people continue to believe the conventional wisdom that you can not lose by getting into property .
so they buy flats and houses , bid up prices and it all becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy .
" a really strong component of demand is speculative , taking advantage of what you think is happening in the market , and the fear factor , that if you do n't get into this market you will be left behind , " said mr brettell .
" these are really very important forces for young people , and this is quite distinctly different , especially in the south of england , from the rest of europe from the us . "
building more the obvious solution would be to build many more houses .
currently we complete just 3.1 new houses or flats per year , for every thousand of our population .
that meant that in 2002 the uk built fewer of them than in 1921 .
the rest of the european union , before its enlargement , built at a much faster rate , of 5.1 houses a year per thousand population .
as a result those 14 other eu countries have 448 dwellings per thousand population , compared to 431 in the uk .
in 2004 the economist kate barker published a report for the government recommending that the country 's local authority planning system be changed to make it easier for house builders to get planning permission in areas where people want to live .
would that make any difference ?
according to an analysis by professor key , the answer must be yes .
land for house building is very restricted by planning laws .
that for shops and offices much less so , and there is , in reality , almost no hindrance to the supply of land for industrial purposes , as this creates jobs .
so , since 1980 , uk house prices have risen by an astonishing 676 % .
but the value of shops , offices and industrial estates has gone up by just 261 % .
what that suggests is that a house that cost £ 30,000 in 1980 , and which is now valued at £ 203,000 , would cost just £ 78,000 - roughly 60 % less - if all the demand since then for house building land had been satisfied .
here and abroad we think we are obsessed .
and funnily enough so do people in the rest of europe .
in almost every country you go to they think they are specially obsessed by owning their own home prof christine whitehead christine whitehead , professor in housing at the lse , says there is nothing special about our interest in houses and their value .
" i go to every country in europe and in almost every country you go to , they think they are specially obsessed by owning their own home . "
comparing our own systems for buying and owning property with those in the rest of europe is very instructive .
despite our perennial complaints about the roguishness of estate agents , dilatoriness of lawyers and the cost of stamp duty , buying and selling here is relatively easy to do .
professor whitehead said our transaction costs are lower then in most of rest of europe , where taxation and the administrative costs of moving can take more than 10 % of a property 's value .
" we have a much more fluid market , in the main , buying and selling does not take very long , " she said .
if you add in the fact that we have lots of houses -which offer more privacy and control than flats , a legal system geared to the home owner and the fact that mortgage repayments are usually cheaper than rent , then you have some pretty good reasons to buy a house .

a really strong component of demand is speculative , taking advantage of what you think is happening in the market , and the fear factor saxon brettell , cambridge econometrics saxon brettell , of the consultancy cambridge econometrics , said a fear of being left behind and a desire to cash in on windfall gains , are big forces driving demand .
" the long run forces are the need for shelter and accommodation , and allowing people to live in the location where they want to .
" but if you did n't believe that you had to get onto the housing ladder as quickly as possible as a young person , we would n't have this stressful activity with the search for early ownership , early on in their careers , especially in the south of england , " he pointed out .
despite the house price crash of the early 1990s , many people continue to believe the conventional wisdom that you can not lose by getting into property .
so they buy flats and houses , bid up prices and it all becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy .
" a really strong component of demand is speculative , taking advantage of what you think is happening in the market , and the fear factor , that if you do n't get into this market you will be left behind , " said mr brettell .
" these are really very important forces for young people , and this is quite distinctly different , especially in the south of england , from the rest of europe from the us . "
building more the obvious solution would be to build many more houses .
currently we complete just 3.1 new houses or flats per year , for every thousand of our population .
that meant that in 2002 the uk built fewer of them than in 1921 .
the rest of the european union , before its enlargement , built at a much faster rate , of 5.1 houses a year per thousand population .
as a result those 14 other eu countries have 448 dwellings per thousand population , compared to 431 in the uk .
in 2004 the economist kate barker published a report for the government recommending that the country 's local authority planning system be changed to make it easier for house builders to get planning permission in areas where people want to live .
would that make any difference ?
according to an analysis by professor key , the answer must be yes .
land for house building is very restricted by planning laws .
that for shops and offices much less so , and there is , in reality , almost no hindrance to the supply of land for industrial purposes , as this creates jobs .
so , since 1980 , uk house prices have risen by an astonishing 676 % .
but the value of shops , offices and industrial estates has gone up by just 261 % .
what that suggests is that a house that cost £ 30,000 in 1980 , and which is now valued at £ 203,000 , would cost just £ 78,000 - roughly 60 % less - if all the demand since then for house building land had been satisfied .
here and abroad we think we are obsessed .
and funnily enough so do people in the rest of europe .
in almost every country you go to they think they are specially obsessed by owning their own home prof christine whitehead christine whitehead , professor in housing at the lse , says there is nothing special about our interest in houses and their value .
" i go to every country in europe and in almost every country you go to , they think they are specially obsessed by owning their own home . "
comparing our own systems for buying and owning property with those in the rest of europe is very instructive .
despite our perennial complaints about the roguishness of estate agents , dilatoriness of lawyers and the cost of stamp duty , buying and selling here is relatively easy to do .
professor whitehead said our transaction costs are lower then in most of rest of europe , where taxation and the administrative costs of moving can take more than 10 % of a property 's value .
" we have a much more fluid market , in the main , buying and selling does not take very long , " she said .
if you add in the fact that we have lots of houses -which offer more privacy and control than flats , a legal system geared to the home owner and the fact that mortgage repayments are usually cheaper than rent , then you have some pretty good reasons to buy a house .

by ian pollock personal finance reporter , bbc news people in the uk seem to be obsessed with property - buying it , doing it up and selling it .
the national obsession with rising house prices generates big headlines look at our fascination with house prices , now measured by at least ten different house price surveys every month .
gawp at the never ending stream of tv programmes about diy , interior decoration , buying a home abroad or making money through outright property speculation .
browse the regular exhibitions aimed at promoting the virtues of buying a house in the latest foreign hotspot , whether it be croatia or romania .
or you can grit your teeth as you hear people just a few years older than yourself reveal how little they paid for their house just five or ten years ago .
there is no doubt about it .
the uk is a nation of homeowners , rather than napoleon 's fabled shop keepers .
more households our national obsession is unlikely to fade .
we are going to see a big increase in the number of smaller , older , households over the next 10 to 20 years prof michael ball even more people will want a home in the coming years .
the population of the uk is predicted to rise from 60 million in 2005 , to 62 million in 2011 , and nearly 65 million by 2021 .
more importantly , the number of households , which is the key determinant of how many homes will be needed , is also going to rise sharply as well .
there are currently 22.8 million households in great britain .
the department for communities & local government -lrb- dclg -rrb- predicts that another million or so will be added in the next five years alone .
and by 2016 there will be 25.1 million households in britain - an increase of 2.3 million in just ten years .
a lot of attention has been given to the fact that the country has seen a surge in immigration recently , principally from eastern europe .
but professor michael ball , of the university of reading business school , said the rise in household numbers will be driven by a large increase in the number of us who are living alone .
" the big driver at the moment is actually the ageing society .
" at the same time general household size is getting smaller , so we are going to see a big increase in the number of smaller , older , households over the next 10 to 20 years , " said professor ball .
the size of the average english household has already fallen steadily from 3.1 in 1961 to 2.29 today .
the dclg predicts that in the next 15 years that will fall even further , to just 2.21 .
not enough houses one of the main reasons why house prices have been so buoyant for the last ten years is that the country has simply not been building enough to meet the demand for houses to buy or rent .
the smallest flat in the uk - a former storage cupboard in notting hill " we estimate that the number of households has been growing at 200,000 or even more each year in recent years , " said milan katri , chief economist of the royal institution of chartered surveyors .
" yet new building has been running at between 140,000 and 160,000 a year , " he added .
thanks to successive government policies , hardly any new council houses have been built for the last 20 years .
some people who might once have rented have been more or less forced to buy instead .
tony key , professor of real estate economics at the cass business school in london , said this under supply of housing has led to a huge distortion in the uk property market .
" somewhere around the mid 1980s we stopped building council houses and we did n't fill in the gap .
" there 's been a group of people who might logically be renters who have been forced into being owner occupiers , " said professor key .
meanwhile millions of former council homes have also been sold by local authorities .

what that suggests is that a house that cost £ 30,000 in 1980 , and which is now valued at £ 203,000 , would cost just £ 78,000 - roughly 60 % less - if all the demand since then for house building land had been satisfied .
here and abroad we think we are obsessed .
and funnily enough so do people in the rest of europe . "
in almost every country you go to they think they are specially obsessed by owning their own home " prof christine whitehead christine whitehead , professor in housing at the lse , says there is nothing special about our interest in houses and their value .
" i go to every country in europe and in almost every country you go to , they think they are specially obsessed by owning their own home . "
comparing our own systems for buying and owning property with those in the rest of europe is very instructive .
despite our perennial complaints about the roguishness of estate agents , dilatoriness of lawyers and the cost of stamp duty , buying and selling here is relatively easy to do .
professor whitehead said our transaction costs are lower then in most of rest of europe , where taxation and the administrative costs of moving can take more than 10 % of a property 's value .
" we have a much more fluid market , in the main , buying and selling does not take very long , " she said .
if you add in the fact that we have lots of houses -which offer more privacy and control than flats , a legal system geared to the home owner and the fact that mortgage repayments are usually cheaper than rent , then you have some pretty good reasons to buy a house .

born in victoria in british columbia , furtado is of portuguese descent looking out the window of nelly furtado 's hotel suite in central london , the skies look overcast and gloomy .
from where the diminutive canadian pop star is sitting , though , the view must look pretty good .
her third album loose is her most successful to date and has spawned two hit singles - maneater , her first uk number one , and promiscuous , her first number one in the us .
a five-continent tour is planned for early 2007 , and earlier this month she was named best pop / rock artist at the world music awards .
one imagines that this acclaim and attention must feel all the sweeter given the tepid response her second album , folklore , received in 2003 .
but if nelly is feeling vindicated or triumphant , she certainly does not show it .
' new perspective ' " it 's like any job really ; you have up spells and down spells , " she tells the bbc news website .
" but every time you come back , you come back stronger , with a new perspective . "
she first hit the charts in 2000 with the song i 'm like a bird despite this , furtado concedes the relative failure of folklore made her wonder if she was really cut out for the music business .
" my first album -lsb- whoa nelly , released in 2000 -rsb- was such a whirlwind , i guess i took all the success i had for granted .
" i think it got me wondering if it was really the career for me - that maybe i should consider doing something different . "
those doubts did not last for long , though , and furtado was soon back in the studio working with a variety of producers - notably celebrated hip-hop and r & b supremo timbaland .
" we were kind of waiting for one another , " says the singer .
" we united at the perfect point in our careers .
" this album has reinvigorated my love of music .
it 's shown me i should be doing this with my life forever . "
furtado is not kidding either .
as far as she is concerned , she is in it for the long haul .
" with age , i think i 've grown to love the pop music industry and the industry in general .
versatile " i really do see myself still putting out albums when i 'm 70 years old , in all different genres . "
having honed her craft not just in her own records but in her collaborations with other artists , furtado has emerged as one of the most credible and versatile performers of the day .
furtado credits timbaland -lrb- r -rrb- for her third album 's " organic " sound so how does she feel about novices being handed the success she has strived so hard to attain , via tv shows like american idol and the x factor ?
" on one level it 's excellent , " she says .
" if a talent show had come to my town when i was growing up , i would have jumped at the opportunity to be part of it .
" if that had happened , though , i would n't have had all the experiences that have enabled me to grow as an artist .
" i feel for some of the pop idols who have n't had that growth period .
it 's a real challenge to their credibility .
" but in the end it depends on how talented you are .
if you 're an awesome singer like -lsb- first american idol winner -rsb- kelly clarkson , you can get over that quite quickly and set your own path . "
nelly furtado 's latest single , all good things , is out on 27 november .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- devolution : who stands where on key issues bbc news / northern ireland graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine friday , 24 november 2006 , 09:03 gmt devolution : who stands where on key issues as politicians prepare to take the necessary steps to reintroduce devolution to northern ireland , we take a look at what the key players think about the issues that will help decide its destiny .
overview uk government agreement : eased the 24 november deadline for a final agreement following the st andrews talks .
instead , sinn fein and the dup must merely indicate who they might nominate as first and deputy first minister .
the deadline for devolution is now march 26 , 2007 , and fresh assembly elections have been set for march 7 .
the government then expects sinn fein and the dup to nominate ministers in preparation for march 26 devolution - without which the assembly will be dissolved .
pitfalls : the independent monitoring commission report on paramilitary activity , due to be published in january , will have to give the ira a clean bill of health if there is to be unionist confidence to move forward .
policing : the government has legislated for the devolution of policing and justice but is concerned by dup comments that it can not happen for many years .
the government insists mi5 must have a role in intelligence gathering , but has not provided the accountability sought by sinn fein and sdlp .
devolution : uk government 's stance irish government agreement : dublin is as anxious as london to get progress on power-sharing and policing .
the irish government may yet hold a referendum on the st andrews agreement and is awaiting a ruling from the attorney general .
the irish government continues to meet the parties and try to resolve the outstanding issues .
devolution : irish government 's stance democratic unionists quick guide : northern ireland seats at stormont : 32 agreement : has not said no to the st andrews agreement but continues to have concerns , not least about the deadline for devolution .
the dup views the timeframe as unrealistic .
refusing to speak to sinn fein until the party recognises and accepts the police service of northern ireland .
power-sharing : seeking more ministerial accountability but is satisfied that it has made some progress on this .
leader ian paisley has met his sinn fein counterpart and sent his deputy , peter robinson , to attend the programme for government committee .

uk government democratic unionists ulster unionists alliance party uk unionists irish government sinn fein sdlp progressive unionists overview uk government agreement : eased the 24 november deadline for a final agreement following the st andrews talks .
instead , sinn fein and the dup must merely indicate who they might nominate as first and deputy first minister .
the deadline for devolution is now march 26 , 2007 , and fresh assembly elections have been set for march 7 .
the government then expects sinn fein and the dup to nominate ministers in preparation for march 26 devolution - without which the assembly will be dissolved .
pitfalls : the independent monitoring commission report on paramilitary activity , due to be published in january , will have to give the ira a clean bill of health if there is to be unionist confidence to move forward .
policing : the government has legislated for the devolution of policing and justice but is concerned by dup comments that it can not happen for many years .
the government insists mi5 must have a role in intelligence gathering , but has not provided the accountability sought by sinn fein and sdlp .
devolution : uk government 's stance back to top irish government agreement : dublin is as anxious as london to get progress on power-sharing and policing .
the irish government may yet hold a referendum on the st andrews agreement and is awaiting a ruling from the attorney general .
the irish government continues to meet the parties and try to resolve the outstanding issues .
devolution : irish government 's stance back to top democratic unionists quick guide : northern ireland seats at stormont : 32 agreement : has not said no to the st andrews agreement but continues to have concerns , not least about the deadline for devolution .
the dup views the timeframe as unrealistic .
refusing to speak to sinn fein until the party recognises and accepts the police service of northern ireland .
power-sharing : seeking more ministerial accountability but is satisfied that it has made some progress on this .
leader ian paisley has met his sinn fein counterpart and sent his deputy , peter robinson , to attend the programme for government committee .
policing : the dup insists sinn fein must sign up to the policing board , psni , the courts and the rule of law before power-sharing can occur .
imc : its report must show the ira has kept its promise to follow a purely political path .
devolution : dup 's stance back to top sinn fein seats at stormont : 24 agreement : keen on a deal , and says st andrews has the potential to move the process forward , subject to further negotiations .
sinn fein also expects the government to deliver on promises to promote the irish language .
has concerns that dup is not fully committed to power-sharing .
policing : is under pressure to call a special party conference , or ard fheis , to sign up to policing for the first time .
the party has concerns , however - not least the role of mi5 and intelligence gathering and the timeframe for the assembly to gain control of policing .
imc : opposes the imc but welcomed its last report which said the ira had disbanded key departments .
devolution : sinn fein 's stance back to top ulster unionists seats at stormont : 24 agreement : the ulster unionists have reserved judgment on st andrews and insisted that the good friday agreement was a better deal for unionists .
policing : wants sinn fein to sign up to policing and the rule of law .
imc : its report will be critical to unionist confidence that the ira has abandoned violence and embraced democracy .
devolution : uup 's stance back to top sdlp seats at stormont : 18 agreement : keen for a power-sharing deal but believes the good friday agreement was a better one for nationalists .
has opposed some of the proposed changes and has fought attempts by the dup to win vetoes at the power-sharing table .
policing : the party wants to break the dup vetoes on the devolution of policing and justice and wants more accountability if mi5 is going to handle intelligence gathering .
imc : will come under pressure to cut sinn fein out of power-sharing if there is a negative imc report .
devolution : sdlp 's stance back to top alliance party seats at stormont : 6 agreement : anxious for a deal , but has complained that the st andrew 's agreement entrenches sectarianism because of enforced coalition government and voting patterns based on unionist and nationalist block votes .
it is upset at not being invited to the programme for government committee .
policing : supports the view that sinn fein must sign up to policing as the price of power-sharing .
imc : wants sanctions against parties that breach democratic principles .
devolution : alliance 's stance back to top progressive unionists seats at stormont : 1 agreement : supported the good friday agreement and wants st andrews to work .
its armed wing , the uvf , is concerned about enforced joint authority between london and dublin if the deal falters .
it is thought to be considering issuing a positive statement on its future but is awaiting events .
policing : the pup 's dawn purvis serves on the policing board and wants sinn fein signed up to policing .
imc : has an uneasy relationship with the monitoring commission , which has been extremely critical of the uvf .
the pup has resumed contact with the body , but the uvf has yet to disband or disarm .
devolution : pup 's stance back to top uk unionists seats at stormont : 1 agreement : opposes st andrews , insisting it is worse than the good friday agreement .
is particularly opposed to compulsory coalition .
policing : sceptical that the ira has given up all criminal or violent activity and is therefore not keen for sinn fein to be involved in policing structures .
insists republicans must uphold the rule of law .

mr straw made the comments in front of a 100-strong audience at a debate about the issue of people from different backgrounds living without integration .
the public debate , called parallel lives , was organised by the bbc in mr straw 's lancashire constituency .
it was prompted by his comments on veils worn by muslim women .
speaking at the debate on thursday night , mr straw told how a friend of his had seen , at first hand , so-called " white flight " - where white families move out of an area when asian families move in .
' white flight ' mr straw said his friend had told him : " how do you think it feels when we 've bought a house in an area because it is mixed and then we see ' for sale ' signs going up ... it 's awful .
" or if we 've put our kids in a mixed school and then all the white kids move out . "
mr straw added that something had to be done to combat the problem .
also on the panel were prof ted cantle , from the institute of community cohesion , who wrote the reports into the bradford , burnley and oldham race riots and shanaz hussain , a magistrate and advisor on women 's issues to the lancashire council of mosques .
building confidence between communities will help integration prof cantle said it was vital to build confidence between communities in order to improve integration and that much of the work could start with education .
" there are many schools now that have twinning links between all asian and all white schools , " he said .
" they have joint teaching programmes - joint arts programmes , joint sports programmes - and even where the parents are beginning to meet each other in different communities .
" but i think that 's only the start ... it 's about building confidence so they can actually mix and interrelate and we can perhaps go on from there to develop mixed intakes and really shared facilities . "
blackburn businesswoman and columnist margo grimshaw and dr amar ahmed , a gp in cheshire and a man tipped as a future parliamentary candidate for the conservative party also joined the debate .

mr straw made the comments in front of a 100-strong audience at a debate about the issue of people from different backgrounds living without integration .
the public debate , called parallel lives , was organised by the bbc in mr straw 's lancashire constituency .
it was prompted by his comments on veils worn by muslim women .
speaking at the debate on thursday night , mr straw told how a friend of his had seen , at first hand , so-called " white flight " - where white families move out of an area when asian families move in .
' white flight ' mr straw said his friend had told him : " how do you think it feels when we 've bought a house in an area because it is mixed and then we see ' for sale ' signs going up ... it 's awful .
" or if we 've put our kids in a mixed school and then all the white kids move out . "
mr straw added that something had to be done to combat the problem .
also on the panel were prof ted cantle , from the institute of community cohesion , who wrote the reports into the bradford , burnley and oldham race riots and shanaz hussain , a magistrate and advisor on women 's issues to the lancashire council of mosques .
building confidence between communities will help integration prof cantle said it was vital to build confidence between communities in order to improve integration and that much of the work could start with education .
" there are many schools now that have twinning links between all asian and all white schools , " he said .
" they have joint teaching programmes - joint arts programmes , joint sports programmes - and even where the parents are beginning to meet each other in different communities .
" but i think that 's only the start ... it 's about building confidence so they can actually mix and interrelate and we can perhaps go on from there to develop mixed intakes and really shared facilities . "

a study at the norwich and norfolk university hospital reveals a decision by nice , which recommends nhs drugs , to back herceptin will cost it £ 1.9m.
the hospital says nice recommended the drug after a campaign by charities but left local nhs trusts to pay for it .
the government said it was up to local trusts to plan their costs effectively .
in august , nice ruled that primary care trusts should pay for patients to have herceptin -lrb- trastuzumab -rrb- . "
we will be the ones to tell them they are not getting treatment that has been proved to be effective and which costs relatively little , because it is not the treatment of the moment " dr tom roques and colleagues it followed a sustained campaign by breast cancer charities and patient groups to win access to the drug .
herceptin targets the her2 protein which can fuel tumours - abouot 20 % of breast cancers are her2 positive .
nice has said breast cancer patients with her2 positive cancers who had a moderate or high chance of their cancer returning should be given herceptin after they have had surgery , radiotherapy or chemotherapy .
' treatment of the moment ' but the doctors at the norfolk and norwich university hospital nhs trust and the university of east anglia said nice provided no extra funding when it made its ruling and does not suggest what cuts should be made to release the extra money that is needed .
the team looked at the number of cancer patients they treat at the hospital , and calculated that they will have to find £ 1.9m each year to make herceptin available to eligible patients .
testing and monitoring costs would add to the bill , they said .
they audited drug costs in their hospital 's cancer centre , and estimated how they could save £ 1.9m by cutting chemotherapy and palliative care treatments .
that sum would pay for 75 patients to receive herceptin .
funding the drug would mean 355 patients not receiving post-surgery treatment - 16 of whom would be cured , or around 200 patients not receiving palliative chemotherapy .
the researchers say there is little long-term data on the clinical benefits and potential dangers of taking herceptin , whereas the established treatments have been shown to be clinically and cost effective .
' a universal problem ' in the bmj , the researchers said : " these untreated patients will be people we know .
" we will be the ones to tell them they are not getting treatment that has been proved to be effective and which costs relatively little , because it is not the treatment of the moment . "
dr david jenner , of the nhs alliance which represents primary care trusts , said : " this is a problem that every pct faces .
" if nice says something has to be funded , it does put pressure on the budget and something has to give way .
" the department of health should keep a central pot of money to fund nice decisions . "
health minister rosie winterton said : " doctors treat patients according to their clinical need .
it is quite wrong to say that herceptin is the only drug that is likely to be funded .
" pcts should always be planning ahead and we would expect them to consider the implications of introducing all drugs on the horizon , not just herceptin . "
dorothy griffiths , a breast cancer patient and founder of the women fighting for herceptin campaign , said the government needed a new action plan to deal with developments in medicine .
" new drugs are coming out for all sorts of illnesses every day and there has to be contingency plans and better management of the money that goes into the nhs .
" there should be good management of money to make sure that it goes into the areas where it is required .
" clinicians should not be put in the situation where they have to make dreadful choices . "

we will be the ones to tell them they are not getting treatment that has been proved to be effective and which costs relatively little , because it is not the treatment of the moment dr tom roques and colleagues it followed a sustained campaign by breast cancer charities and patient groups to win access to the drug .
herceptin targets the her2 protein which can fuel tumours - abouot 20 % of breast cancers are her2 positive .
nice has said breast cancer patients with her2 positive cancers who had a moderate or high chance of their cancer returning should be given herceptin after they have had surgery , radiotherapy or chemotherapy .
' treatment of the moment ' but the doctors at the norfolk and norwich university hospital nhs trust and the university of east anglia said nice provided no extra funding when it made its ruling and does not suggest what cuts should be made to release the extra money that is needed .
the team looked at the number of cancer patients they treat at the hospital , and calculated that they will have to find £ 1.9m each year to make herceptin available to eligible patients .
testing and monitoring costs would add to the bill , they said .
they audited drug costs in their hospital 's cancer centre , and estimated how they could save £ 1.9m by cutting chemotherapy and palliative care treatments .
that sum would pay for 75 patients to receive herceptin .
funding the drug would mean 355 patients not receiving post-surgery treatment - 16 of whom would be cured , or around 200 patients not receiving palliative chemotherapy .
the researchers say there is little long-term data on the clinical benefits and potential dangers of taking herceptin , whereas the established treatments have been shown to be clinically and cost effective .
' a universal problem ' in the bmj , the researchers said : " these untreated patients will be people we know .
" we will be the ones to tell them they are not getting treatment that has been proved to be effective and which costs relatively little , because it is not the treatment of the moment . "
dr david jenner , of the nhs alliance which represents primary care trusts , said : " this is a problem that every pct faces .
" if nice says something has to be funded , it does put pressure on the budget and something has to give way .
" the department of health should keep a central pot of money to fund nice decisions . "
health minister rosie winterton said : " doctors treat patients according to their clinical need .
it is quite wrong to say that herceptin is the only drug that is likely to be funded .
" pcts should always be planning ahead and we would expect them to consider the implications of introducing all drugs on the horizon , not just herceptin . "
dorothy griffiths , a breast cancer patient and founder of the women fighting for herceptin campaign , said the government needed a new action plan to deal with developments in medicine .
" new drugs are coming out for all sorts of illnesses every day and there has to be contingency plans and better management of the money that goes into the nhs .
" there should be good management of money to make sure that it goes into the areas where it is required .
" clinicians should not be put in the situation where they have to make dreadful choices . "

the latest estimates by wow creator blizzard suggest almost 7.5 million people have bought it .
now the world of warcraft is growing again via a substantial expansion pack called the burning crusade .
for those that do n't know the burning crusade refers to the ongoing efforts of the burning legion , a demonic army led bykil 'jaeden the deceiver , to destroy all life in the universe .
testing times a big software update due towards the end of 2006 will make changes to the existing game in preparation for the burning crusade .
this will mean some changes for all players but most of the extras in the expansion will only be available to those that buy the expansion pack .
wow puts players in the fictional fantasy world of azeroth where they go adventuring by carrying out quests and killing monsters for loot usually money or increasingly powerful equipment .
the cash can be used to buy better gear and the fallen loot can be sold or auctioned to raise money .
players control characters from one of eight races .
their character can play one of nine classes , such as warrior or rogue , and they can learn two of 12 professions .
higher level characters hit harder or have more magical power and spells at their disposal .
the many possible permutations of character , class , profession and level mean the game is easy to play but hard to master and this probably accounts for its ongoing popularity .
burning crusade highlights level cap increased to 70 two new playable races - blood elf -lrb- horde -rrb- and draenei -lrb- alliance -rrb- opening up of class structure .
horde can play paladins , alliance can play shamans new spells and talents for high-level characters expanded talent trees new starting zones for new races , entire new continent outland and new high-level dungeons .
new profession , jewelcrafting and introduction of socketed items introduction of flying mounts honour system to be scrapped introduction of player-v-player arenas introduction of a " looking for group " system that helps players find other players doing the same quests in pictures : the burning crusade the expansion pack is currently in a closed beta test that gives a few lucky players a chance to try it out and log any bugs they find .
the bbc news website was invited to join the beta test and took the chance to create characters using the new races and take them questing around the new starting areas .
blizzard has stressed that the beta only gives a preview of what will be in the final expansion .
a lot could change between the test system and the version that makes it on to shop shelves .
wacky races the two new races , blood elves and draenei , have been designed to balance the game 's opposing factions .
races in wow are members of either the horde or alliance factions .
the alliance counts humans , dwarfs , gnomes and night elves among its ranks and these characters are generally easier on the eye than the horde which has the undead , orc , troll and tauren races .
however , the horde starting quests are far more atmospheric than the rather generic fantasy setting of novice alliance characters .
as a horde race there is no doubt that the blood elves are much prettier than their brethren and their starting area is spectacular - especially silvermoon city .
unfortunately , i found the early experience with a blood elf a bit tame .
it felt too similar to a starting alliance character and suffered the same lack of depth .
by contrast the opening stages of draenei characters feels very different as this race has crash-landed on azeroth in a space-ship .
early quests involve dealing with the aftermath of the crash and trying to find out what effect this has had on local flora and fauna .
the main section of the crashed ship , called the exodar , is the draenei capital and is just as spectacular as silvermoon .
the introduction of the science-fictional element made the draenei stand out and their accents and physical characteristics , horns and tails , gives them more personality than the rather anodyne blood elves .
the draenei racial ability , healing , also seemed more useful at low levels than the silence spell available to blood elves .
many of the earlier quests for both blood elves and draenei seemed to be more intricate than those in the main game .
often it was not a case of just killing lots of blameless creatures but more about investigating , helping other denizens and solving problems .
these early adventures did a very good job of getting players to explore the new starting areas , finding out the lay of the land .
the early quests also gave better equipment early on - in its opening stages world of warcraft can be a bit of a grind involving wanton slaughter just to gather enough cash for some shoddy weapons or armour .

the latest estimates by wow creator blizzard suggest almost 7.5 million people have bought it .
now the world of warcraft is growing again via a substantial expansion pack called the burning crusade .
for those that do n't know the burning crusade refers to the ongoing efforts of the burning legion , a demonic army led bykil 'jaeden the deceiver , to destroy all life in the universe .
testing times a big software update due towards the end of 2006 will make changes to the existing game in preparation for the burning crusade .
this will mean some changes for all players but most of the extras in the expansion will only be available to those that buy the expansion pack .
wow puts players in the fictional fantasy world of azeroth where they go adventuring by carrying out quests and killing monsters for loot usually money or increasingly powerful equipment .
the cash can be used to buy better gear and the fallen loot can be sold or auctioned to raise money .
players control characters from one of eight races .
their character can play one of nine classes , such as warrior or rogue , and they can learn two of 12 professions .
higher level characters hit harder or have more magical power and spells at their disposal .
the many possible permutations of character , class , profession and level mean the game is easy to play but hard to master and this probably accounts for its ongoing popularity .
burning crusade highlights level cap increased to 70 two new playable races - blood elf -lrb- horde -rrb- and draenei -lrb- alliance -rrb- opening up of class structure .
horde can play paladins , alliance can play shamans new spells and talents for high-level characters expanded talent trees new starting zones for new races , entire new continent outland and new high-level dungeons .
new profession , jewelcrafting and introduction of socketed items introduction of flying mounts honour system to be scrapped introduction of player-v-player arenas introduction of a " looking for group " system that helps players find other players doing the same quests in pictures : the burning crusade the expansion pack is currently in a closed beta test that gives a few lucky players a chance to try it out and log any bugs they find .
the bbc news website was invited to join the beta test and took the chance to create characters using the new races and take them questing around the new starting areas .
blizzard has stressed that the beta only gives a preview of what will be in the final expansion .

unfortunately , i found the early experience with a blood elf a bit tame .
it felt too similar to a starting alliance character and suffered the same lack of depth .
the blood elves are undoubtedly prettier than others in their faction by contrast the opening stages of draenei characters feels very different as this race has crash-landed on azeroth in a space-ship .
early quests involve dealing with the aftermath of the crash and trying to find out what effect this has had on local flora and fauna .
the main section of the crashed ship , called the exodar , is the draenei capital and is just as spectacular as silvermoon .
the introduction of the science-fictional element made the draenei stand out and their accents and physical characteristics , horns and tails , gives them more personality than the rather anodyne blood elves .
the draenei racial ability , healing , also seemed more useful at low levels than the silence spell available to blood elves .
many of the earlier quests for both blood elves and draenei seemed to be more intricate than those in the main game .
often it was not a case of just killing lots of blameless creatures but more about investigating , helping other denizens and solving problems .
these early adventures did a very good job of getting players to explore the new starting areas , finding out the lay of the land .
the early quests also gave better equipment early on - in its opening stages world of warcraft can be a bit of a grind involving wanton slaughter just to gather enough cash for some shoddy weapons or armour .

the latest estimates by wow creator blizzard suggest almost 7.5 million people have bought it .
now the world of warcraft is growing again via a substantial expansion pack called the burning crusade .
for those that do n't know the burning crusade refers to the ongoing efforts of the burning legion , a demonic army led bykil 'jaeden the deceiver , to destroy all life in the universe .
testing times a big software update due towards the end of 2006 will make changes to the existing game in preparation for the burning crusade .
this will mean some changes for all players but most of the extras in the expansion will only be available to those that buy the expansion pack .
wow puts players in the fictional fantasy world of azeroth where they go adventuring by carrying out quests and killing monsters for loot usually money or increasingly powerful equipment .
the cash can be used to buy better gear and the fallen loot can be sold or auctioned to raise money .
players control characters from one of eight races .
their character can play one of nine classes , such as warrior or rogue , and they can learn two of 12 professions .
higher level characters hit harder or have more magical power and spells at their disposal .
the many possible permutations of character , class , profession and level mean the game is easy to play but hard to master and this probably accounts for its ongoing popularity .
burning crusade highlights level cap increased to 70 two new playable races - blood elf -lrb- horde -rrb- and draenei -lrb- alliance -rrb- opening up of class structure .
horde can play paladins , alliance can play shamans new spells and talents for high-level characters expanded talent trees new starting zones for new races , entire new continent outland and new high-level dungeons .
new profession , jewelcrafting and introduction of socketed items introduction of flying mounts honour system to be scrapped introduction of player-v-player arenas introduction of a " looking for group " system that helps players find other players doing the same quests in pictures : the burning crusade the expansion pack is currently in a closed beta test that gives a few lucky players a chance to try it out and log any bugs they find .
the bbc news website was invited to join the beta test and took the chance to create characters using the new races and take them questing around the new starting areas .
blizzard has stressed that the beta only gives a preview of what will be in the final expansion .
a lot could change between the test system and the version that makes it on to shop shelves .
wacky races the two new races , blood elves and draenei , have been designed to balance the game 's opposing factions .
races in wow are members of either the horde or alliance factions .
the alliance counts humans , dwarfs , gnomes and night elves among its ranks and these characters are generally easier on the eye than the horde which has the undead , orc , troll and tauren races .
however , the horde starting quests are far more atmospheric than the rather generic fantasy setting of novice alliance characters .
as a horde race there is no doubt that the blood elves are much prettier than their brethren and their starting area is spectacular - especially silvermoon city .
