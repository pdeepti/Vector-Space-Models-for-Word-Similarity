germany has asked the us for more information about an alleged secret plan by saddam hussein to defend baghdad before the war after a us paper reported its spies had passed it on to american forces . this week the new york times reported that german intelligence agents had obtained a copy of the plan and passed it on to the us weeks before the invasion . the report , which germany has vehemently denied , has triggered huge controversy and calls for a parliamentary inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper report has caused an uproar in germany on friday , germany still stuck to its denial but a government spokesman said berlin had asked washington for more details about the affair .
the german government is hoping in particularly that the us can shed light on the classified military study on which the times report was based and whether it included a sketch map that was printed by the paper . " we have renewed our request to the american side and expressed the wish : if you can , give us the information whether such a secret study exists , is there a study with sketches , where do you believe such a sketch came from ? "
steg said . he added that german authorities were currently in contact with several us officials to find out what the " alleged secret military study " was all about . steg , much like germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , reiterated that there was no direct contact between its agents in baghdad and us authorities . no aid i n selecti n g bombi n g targets germany , under former chancellor gerhard schröder , vocally opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
but a series of revelations in recent weeks has raised uncomfortable questions about its exact role in the war . a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , parts of which were released to the public , underlined that german intelligence agents in iraq mainly supplied information on civilian sites that the americans should avoid bombing . berlin has also admitted that its spies provided descriptions of the iraqi military and police presence in baghdad , but has strongly rejected allegations that the information was used to select bombing targets . doubts about authe n ticity of sketch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein on friday steg stressed that the german government was n't aware of the secret saddam hussein defense plan and thus could n't have passed it to washington . " you ca n't pass on something that you do n't know , " steg said . steg also raised doubts over the authenticity of the diagram printed in the new york times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.03.2006 opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling rules are not for the faint-hearted germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .
politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .
and it is in the department of old habits that germany is showing its greatest weakness . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spelling divide as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed .

but latvia , which has fought hard to keep its own language , says no amount of eu rhetoric will change it back from eiro .
-lrb- jan 5 , 2006 -rrb- german states back spelling reform while several german publishers recently rejected the country 's six-year-old spelling reform , a clear majority of states intend to stick to the change in schools , according to a news report .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .

but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .

" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .
" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '
and post-1989 , he was the conscience of the nation . " but in fact , szabo met with broad understanding rather than outrage , while gervai received an avalanche of threat letters and indignation that he had gone public with the case .
it was obvious to him what the hungarian people would have preferred to happen : " if szabo had ever meant anything to me then i would have destroyed his file when i came across it in the archives and prevented it from ever reaching the public , " he said , describing the main response his findings have elicited . no soul-searchi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviet tanks in prague in 1968 unlike germany and the czech republic , which opened up police files in the early 1990s , hungary waited until 1997 to allow its citizens to apply for access to their files in the secret police archives . but the new law failed to usher in an era of soul-searching - not least because the archive is only required to release files it decides do not represent a threat to national security . the result is that only selective files get published , usually for reasons of political expedience , such as during election campaigns . to some , a complete opening of the archives would amount to laying the cards on the table and might prevent files being used as political tools .

" these are people with a lifetime behind them , and they 're being slandered for political ends .

" political observers believe that not only former communists have a vested interest in keeping the files under lock and key - they believe that parliamentary parties across the board see the hungarian people 's reluctance to banish the ghosts of the last few decades as a natural turning away from the past . but given that some 150,000 hungarians are thought to have collaborated with the secret police , it seems likely that those ghosts will catch up with the public soon . harriett ferenci -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary to open spy files making an about-turn , hungary 's ruling socialist party said on wednesday that it now backed fully opening communist-era secret service files , in an attempt to confront the country 's ghosts of the past .

but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .

" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '
and post-1989 , he was the conscience of the nation . " but in fact , szabo met with broad understanding rather than outrage , while gervai received an avalanche of threat letters and indignation that he had gone public with the case .
it was obvious to him what the hungarian people would have preferred to happen : " if szabo had ever meant anything to me then i would have destroyed his file when i came across it in the archives and prevented it from ever reaching the public , " he said , describing the main response his findings have elicited . no soul-searchi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviet tanks in prague in 1968 unlike germany and the czech republic , which opened up police files in the early 1990s , hungary waited until 1997 to allow its citizens to apply for access to their files in the secret police archives . but the new law failed to usher in an era of soul-searching - not least because the archive is only required to release files it decides do not represent a threat to national security . the result is that only selective files get published , usually for reasons of political expedience , such as during election campaigns . to some , a complete opening of the archives would amount to laying the cards on the table and might prevent files being used as political tools .

2004 of manslaughter and given an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for slaughtering and consuming a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin at his home in the central german town of rotenburg and videotaping the act .
meiwes had met his victim on the internet after he advertised for someone willing to be eaten . a federal tribunal last april upheld an appeal lodged by state prosecutors , calling the verdict too lenient , and ordered a new trial which began in january .
prosecutors are seeking a life sentence . based on real-life events the hollywood thriller tells the tale of fictional american criminal psychology student katie -lrb- keri russell -rrb- who is drawn in by the bizarre case of a meiwes-like character called oliver hartwin . much like meiwes ' life , the cannibal plot of the movie shows a younger hartwin as a loner forced by an overbearing mother to wear lederhosen at school .
like meiwes , he dreams up an imaginary friend . later , as a computer repairman - meiwes 's own profession - the film-character is drawn to the " cannibal cantina " web site in his search for a willing victim . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal back on trial armin meiwes , the self-confessed german cannibal convicted of killing a man , began his retrial on murder charges thursday in frankfurt .

" after the military 's nuclear tests in 1998 at the latest , india was isolated on the nuclear policy front and dealing with sanctions - from the government and congress in washington in order to quell the spread of nuclear weapons , " wrote germany 's conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

and he suggested nuclear cooperation if india were to subject its civilian nuclear facilities to international controls .

" " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .

but for robert hoyzer , the german soccer referee whose name is synonymous with the phrase " betting scandal , " shape certainly does . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv appearances gave way to court appearances for the crooked ref in january 2005 , hoyzer , then a 25-year-old referee , definitively burnt his bridges with german soccer when he confessed to fixing matches on behalf of a croatian betting ring . in what turned out to be germany 's biggest football scandal since the 1970s , hoyzer is said to have taken home 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,900 -rrb- and a wide-screen tv in exchange for making game-influencing calls in dozens of matches .
in the end , however , hoyzer 's hubris earned him more than just money and electronics .
he also got a lifetime ban from the game , and a two year , five month prison sentence , currently under appeal . that other football ... after considering his options , it seems the soccer pariah decided his best chance of salvaging his career lay in an american sport that is , to put it mildly , little known in europe .
you know .
that other football . hozyer has begun training to be a place kicker with the berlin adlers , an american football team that plays in germany 's american football league .
he told news agencies he hopes to sign a contract in time for the new season , in april , when berlin will face off against dresden . " i have been training with the team for a week and hope to be able to sign a contract within the next few weeks , " hoyzer told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the not ready for prime time players ?
berlin thunder v. frankfurt galaxy in a comment that seemed to indicate he has at last got the knack for honesty , hoyzer addressed the downward slide that left him looking for a way to crawl up from the rock-bottom of germany 's sporting heap . " i do not have a future in -lrb- german -rrb- football and have considered how best to use my abilities , " he said . so far , hoyzer has not commented on how it feels to move from a sport that is - by a very wide margin - the most popular and prestigious one in europe , to one that is little understood and even less respected . fall from grace american football players in germany tend to be either professionals who are past their prime and want to make some extra money on the euro circuit , or youngsters who have n't yet made it in to the us national football league but have n't given up their hopes of doing so . some previous german soccer pros , like axel kruse , manfred burgsmüller and ingo anderbrügg , have made the switch to american football .
but none of them has done it under the same cloud of notoriety as hoyzer . if the ex-referee really plans to get along with his american teammates , he may want to start working on his american english idioms .
football phrases like " first down and 10 to go , " " do it for the gipper , " and " hail mary " might come in handy - along with the old schoolyard standard " cheaters never prosper .

" it 's already clear that globalization constantly generates unique ironies , " wrote liberal austrian daily der standard .
" the new nuclear pact that the us president agreed on with indian prime minister manmohan singh may indeed serve the long-term aim of increasing independence from oil .
but it also comes at a strategic cost : the chinese will be just as mistrustful of the newly declared indian-american friendship as pakistan , not to mention iran . " " it 's understandable and natural that democracies like india and the us come closer , " said sweden 's liberal daily dagens nyheter .
" one can also argue in favor of the pact on nuclear power sealed during president bush 's visit . … still , the matter is somewhat disturbing .
india has not signed the npt .
now signals are being sent that , in the final analysis , threaten all the work done to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . … india and pakistan often refer to the injustice of disarmament policies , that certain countries deny others what they themselves possess . … now , at worst , history could repeat itself . " " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .
and it sends a message to nuclear wannabes like north korea or iran that the us government will only withhold nuclear weapon technology from regimes that do n't suit it .
the obvious double standard belies the superpower 's claim to moral leadership .
the us president must be prepared for accusations that the half-baked nuclear deal undermines the architecture of global security . " " by signing this historic pact with india , bush killed two birds with one stone , " wrote french daily liberation .
" the aim is to compensate the 21st century 's most important geo-strategic upheaval .
india has the same trump cards as china : dynamic population development , the will to develop , technical abilities and the natural ambitions of a very old civilization can make it the world 's third-biggest economic power in a few decades .
india also has trump cards that china does n't have : civil rights , the rule of law , a democratic tradition , a decentralized system and a broad middle class that is open to the - above all english-speaking - world . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language .

last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?
are the discussio n s about stadium safety a n d bird flu of co n cer n to brazilia n s ? the reports of bird flu did shock people here , but we hope that the problem will be under control by the time the world cup starts .
it is well-known that the germans are organizing everything very carefully so brazilians are looking favorably on the world cup preparations . safety is always a topic of discussion at major events , but in brazil , people talk a lot more about the beauty of the stadiums , which are shown during bundesliga broadcasts .
on weekends , reports about the host venues are also broadcast .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?
are the discussio n s about stadium safety a n d bird flu of co n cer n to brazilia n s ? the reports of bird flu did shock people here , but we hope that the problem will be under control by the time the world cup starts .
it is well-known that the germans are organizing everything very carefully so brazilians are looking favorably on the world cup preparations . safety is always a topic of discussion at major events , but in brazil , people talk a lot more about the beauty of the stadiums , which are shown during bundesliga broadcasts .
on weekends , reports about the host venues are also broadcast .

time is running out to find a solution before the issue goes to the security council . " unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement today , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters after talks between france , britain , germany and iran in vienna ended after just two hours . iran had called for the last-minute meeting with the eu representatives ahead of a scheduled session with the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on monday .
the un watchdog is to make an assessment of iran 's nuclear program that will then be sent to the un security council for deliberation over possible punitive action such as sanctions . racing against the clock " time is running out , " steinmeier said after the talks in vienna with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani failed to bring improvement .
" if we want success we have to act now , " he added . the german foreign minister regretted that although the talks " were carried out in a constructive atmosphere " they were unable to reach agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani prior to the meeting there had appeared little room for compromise , with tehran insisting on its right to enrich uranium and europe and the united states saying iran must give up the process , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atomic bomb material . " unfortunately , we could not obtain an agreement with mr. larijani , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said following the talks at the german ambassador 's residence in vienna . also present at the hurriedly-arranged meeting , which had been requested by larijani , was european union foreign policy chief javier solana and a british official representing foreign minister jack straw , who was ill . eu demands full cooperation earlier this week the eu troika warned tehran in writing that progress was totally dependent on iran stopping uranium enrichment and cooperating with un nuclear inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani with javier solana " anything short of this would result in a public disagreement , which would set back our shared objectives , " according to a letter from the trio 's foreign ministers and solana obtained by afp . the united states had also voiced skepticism about the prospects of success of friday 's talks .
" we 're under no illusions , " us state department deputy spokesman adam ereli said in washington . talks with moscow fail larijani had arrived in vienna after talks in moscow also failed to produce an agreement on a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil - thus giving tehran the fuel it needs but not the technology . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said friday that a deal with iran on its nuclear enrichment program was still possible before the march 6 meeting of the iaea , the interfax news agency reported .
" there always is an opportunity to reach an agreement , " interfax quoted lavrov as saying in response to a question about whether it was still possible to negotiate an agreement with iran preventing its referral to the un security council at monday 's meeting of the atomic watchdog . security council action pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's meeting hall in vienna the iaea had initially on february 4 reported iran to the un security council but allowed a month for diplomacy before the world body decides what measures , if any , to take against tehran . the iaea has consistently called on iran to suspend uranium enrichment as a confidence-building measure .
but the islamic republic last month fed a 10-centrifuge research cascade at a facility in natanz with the feedstock uranium gas , signaling it was pushing ahead with enrichment it says is essential for a civilian energy program . in a report earlier this week , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said iran had failed to answer crucial questions about its nuclear program after three years of iaea investigations , although he stopped short of saying tehran was making atomic weapons . earlier eu talks with iran - aimed at promising tehran trade and security benefits in return for guarantees it is not seeking to acquire atomic weapons - had been torpedoed by the islamic republic 's insistence on enrichment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ties iran moratorium to joint enrichment deal as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.03.2006 opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling rules are not for the faint-hearted germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .
politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .
and it is in the department of old habits that germany is showing its greatest weakness . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spelling divide as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .

" after the military 's nuclear tests in 1998 at the latest , india was isolated on the nuclear policy front and dealing with sanctions - from the government and congress in washington in order to quell the spread of nuclear weapons , " wrote germany 's conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" in the past year , bush all but recognized india as a nuclear power - for strategic and economic reasons as well as recognizing the facts .
and he suggested nuclear cooperation if india were to subject its civilian nuclear facilities to international controls .
the leadership in delhi has now largely agreed to that .
that 's no small thing for an elite with a great need for prestige and a state that has n't joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . "
" it 's already clear that globalization constantly generates unique ironies , " wrote liberal austrian daily der standard .
" the new nuclear pact that the us president agreed on with indian prime minister manmohan singh may indeed serve the long-term aim of increasing independence from oil .
but it also comes at a strategic cost : the chinese will be just as mistrustful of the newly declared indian-american friendship as pakistan , not to mention iran . " " it 's understandable and natural that democracies like india and the us come closer , " said sweden 's liberal daily dagens nyheter .
" one can also argue in favor of the pact on nuclear power sealed during president bush 's visit . … still , the matter is somewhat disturbing .
india has not signed the npt .
now signals are being sent that , in the final analysis , threaten all the work done to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . … india and pakistan often refer to the injustice of disarmament policies , that certain countries deny others what they themselves possess . … now , at worst , history could repeat itself . " " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .
and it sends a message to nuclear wannabes like north korea or iran that the us government will only withhold nuclear weapon technology from regimes that do n't suit it .
the obvious double standard belies the superpower 's claim to moral leadership .
the us president must be prepared for accusations that the half-baked nuclear deal undermines the architecture of global security . " " by signing this historic pact with india , bush killed two birds with one stone , " wrote french daily liberation .
" the aim is to compensate the 21st century 's most important geo-strategic upheaval .
india has the same trump cards as china : dynamic population development , the will to develop , technical abilities and the natural ambitions of a very old civilization can make it the world 's third-biggest economic power in a few decades .
india also has trump cards that china does n't have : civil rights , the rule of law , a democratic tradition , a decentralized system and a broad middle class that is open to the - above all english-speaking - world . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

" unfortunately , we could not obtain an agreement with mr. larijani , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said following the talks at the german ambassador 's residence in vienna . also present at the hurriedly-arranged meeting , which had been requested by larijani , was european union foreign policy chief javier solana and a british official representing foreign minister jack straw , who was ill . eu demands full cooperation earlier this week the eu troika warned tehran in writing that progress was totally dependent on iran stopping uranium enrichment and cooperating with un nuclear inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani with javier solana " anything short of this would result in a public disagreement , which would set back our shared objectives , " according to a letter from the trio 's foreign ministers and solana obtained by afp . the united states had also voiced skepticism about the prospects of success of friday 's talks .
" we 're under no illusions , " us state department deputy spokesman adam ereli said in washington . talks with moscow fail larijani had arrived in vienna after talks in moscow also failed to produce an agreement on a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil - thus giving tehran the fuel it needs but not the technology . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said friday that a deal with iran on its nuclear enrichment program was still possible before the march 6 meeting of the iaea , the interfax news agency reported .
" there always is an opportunity to reach an agreement , " interfax quoted lavrov as saying in response to a question about whether it was still possible to negotiate an agreement with iran preventing its referral to the un security council at monday 's meeting of the atomic watchdog . security council action pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's meeting hall in vienna the iaea had initially on february 4 reported iran to the un security council but allowed a month for diplomacy before the world body decides what measures , if any , to take against tehran . the iaea has consistently called on iran to suspend uranium enrichment as a confidence-building measure .
but the islamic republic last month fed a 10-centrifuge research cascade at a facility in natanz with the feedstock uranium gas , signaling it was pushing ahead with enrichment it says is essential for a civilian energy program . in a report earlier this week , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said iran had failed to answer crucial questions about its nuclear program after three years of iaea investigations , although he stopped short of saying tehran was making atomic weapons . earlier eu talks with iran - aimed at promising tehran trade and security benefits in return for guarantees it is not seeking to acquire atomic weapons - had been torpedoed by the islamic republic 's insistence on enrichment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ties iran moratorium to joint enrichment deal as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 eastern europe draws veil of silence over communist past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in hungary would rather not lift the lid on informer subterfuge with a number of high-profile hungarians recently named as former secret-police informers , calls for a look at the country 's past have been getting louder .
but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .
" not five years ago - 50 !
i was arrested with two school friends , and we were questioned for three days and nights .
eventually i was forced to sign a statement saying i would work with the secret police . " faci n g the demo n s the pervasive presence of informers and collaborators during the communist era is an issue that has never been addressed at a political level in hungary .
even so , it 's a skeleton in the closet of public consciousness that refuses to go away . andras gervai , a historian from budapest , insists that the country needs to face its demons . " it can become very problematic when a country fails to reflect on its past , " he said .
" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .
" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '
and post-1989 , he was the conscience of the nation . " but in fact , szabo met with broad understanding rather than outrage , while gervai received an avalanche of threat letters and indignation that he had gone public with the case .
it was obvious to him what the hungarian people would have preferred to happen : " if szabo had ever meant anything to me then i would have destroyed his file when i came across it in the archives and prevented it from ever reaching the public , " he said , describing the main response his findings have elicited . no soul-searchi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviet tanks in prague in 1968 unlike germany and the czech republic , which opened up police files in the early 1990s , hungary waited until 1997 to allow its citizens to apply for access to their files in the secret police archives . but the new law failed to usher in an era of soul-searching - not least because the archive is only required to release files it decides do not represent a threat to national security . the result is that only selective files get published , usually for reasons of political expedience , such as during election campaigns . to some , a complete opening of the archives would amount to laying the cards on the table and might prevent files being used as political tools .
but others feel it would be counter-productive . " there are so many people who can no longer defend themselves , " szabo said .
" these are people with a lifetime behind them , and they 're being slandered for political ends .
and they can not tell their side of the story . " political observers believe that not only former communists have a vested interest in keeping the files under lock and key - they believe that parliamentary parties across the board see the hungarian people 's reluctance to banish the ghosts of the last few decades as a natural turning away from the past . but given that some 150,000 hungarians are thought to have collaborated with the secret police , it seems likely that those ghosts will catch up with the public soon . harriett ferenci -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary to open spy files making an about-turn , hungary 's ruling socialist party said on wednesday that it now backed fully opening communist-era secret service files , in an attempt to confront the country 's ghosts of the past .

but for robert hoyzer , the german soccer referee whose name is synonymous with the phrase " betting scandal , " shape certainly does . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv appearances gave way to court appearances for the crooked ref in january 2005 , hoyzer , then a 25-year-old referee , definitively burnt his bridges with german soccer when he confessed to fixing matches on behalf of a croatian betting ring . in what turned out to be germany 's biggest football scandal since the 1970s , hoyzer is said to have taken home 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,900 -rrb- and a wide-screen tv in exchange for making game-influencing calls in dozens of matches .
in the end , however , hoyzer 's hubris earned him more than just money and electronics .
he also got a lifetime ban from the game , and a two year , five month prison sentence , currently under appeal . that other football ... after considering his options , it seems the soccer pariah decided his best chance of salvaging his career lay in an american sport that is , to put it mildly , little known in europe .
you know .
that other football . hozyer has begun training to be a place kicker with the berlin adlers , an american football team that plays in germany 's american football league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 us-india nuclear pact - a double standard ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh sealed the atomic deal on thursday europe 's newspapers on friday were critical of the us-india pact in which washington effectively recognizes delhi 's right to develop nuclear weapons . " after the military 's nuclear tests in 1998 at the latest , india was isolated on the nuclear policy front and dealing with sanctions - from the government and congress in washington in order to quell the spread of nuclear weapons , " wrote germany 's conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" in the past year , bush all but recognized india as a nuclear power - for strategic and economic reasons as well as recognizing the facts .
and he suggested nuclear cooperation if india were to subject its civilian nuclear facilities to international controls .
the leadership in delhi has now largely agreed to that .
that 's no small thing for an elite with a great need for prestige and a state that has n't joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . "
" it 's already clear that globalization constantly generates unique ironies , " wrote liberal austrian daily der standard .
" the new nuclear pact that the us president agreed on with indian prime minister manmohan singh may indeed serve the long-term aim of increasing independence from oil .
but it also comes at a strategic cost : the chinese will be just as mistrustful of the newly declared indian-american friendship as pakistan , not to mention iran . " " it 's understandable and natural that democracies like india and the us come closer , " said sweden 's liberal daily dagens nyheter .
" one can also argue in favor of the pact on nuclear power sealed during president bush 's visit . … still , the matter is somewhat disturbing .
india has not signed the npt .
now signals are being sent that , in the final analysis , threaten all the work done to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . … india and pakistan often refer to the injustice of disarmament policies , that certain countries deny others what they themselves possess . … now , at worst , history could repeat itself . " " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .
and it sends a message to nuclear wannabes like north korea or iran that the us government will only withhold nuclear weapon technology from regimes that do n't suit it .
the obvious double standard belies the superpower 's claim to moral leadership .
the us president must be prepared for accusations that the half-baked nuclear deal undermines the architecture of global security . " " by signing this historic pact with india , bush killed two birds with one stone , " wrote french daily liberation .
" the aim is to compensate the 21st century 's most important geo-strategic upheaval .
india has the same trump cards as china : dynamic population development , the will to develop , technical abilities and the natural ambitions of a very old civilization can make it the world 's third-biggest economic power in a few decades .
india also has trump cards that china does n't have : civil rights , the rule of law , a democratic tradition , a decentralized system and a broad middle class that is open to the - above all english-speaking - world . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?
are the discussio n s about stadium safety a n d bird flu of co n cer n to brazilia n s ? the reports of bird flu did shock people here , but we hope that the problem will be under control by the time the world cup starts .
it is well-known that the germans are organizing everything very carefully so brazilians are looking favorably on the world cup preparations . safety is always a topic of discussion at major events , but in brazil , people talk a lot more about the beauty of the stadiums , which are shown during bundesliga broadcasts .
on weekends , reports about the host venues are also broadcast .
germany 's foreign publicity is currently very good . geraldo hoffmann interviewed giovane elber -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can play a very good world cup " despite his resignation in 2004 , germany 's former top soccer coach keeps tabs on the team .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?
are the discussio n s about stadium safety a n d bird flu of co n cer n to brazilia n s ? the reports of bird flu did shock people here , but we hope that the problem will be under control by the time the world cup starts .
it is well-known that the germans are organizing everything very carefully so brazilians are looking favorably on the world cup preparations . safety is always a topic of discussion at major events , but in brazil , people talk a lot more about the beauty of the stadiums , which are shown during bundesliga broadcasts .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?

it is well-known that the germans are organizing everything very carefully so brazilians are looking favorably on the world cup preparations . safety is always a topic of discussion at major events , but in brazil , people talk a lot more about the beauty of the stadiums , which are shown during bundesliga broadcasts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.03.2006 opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling rules are not for the faint-hearted germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .
politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .
and it is in the department of old habits that germany is showing its greatest weakness . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spelling divide as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed .
-lrb- aug 1 , 2005 -rrb- you say euro , i say eiro the european central bank is trying to curb varying spellings of the word euro .
but latvia , which has fought hard to keep its own language , says no amount of eu rhetoric will change it back from eiro .
-lrb- jan 5 , 2006 -rrb- german states back spelling reform while several german publishers recently rejected the country 's six-year-old spelling reform , a clear majority of states intend to stick to the change in schools , according to a news report .

what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?

it is well-known that the germans are organizing everything very carefully so brazilians are looking favorably on the world cup preparations . safety is always a topic of discussion at major events , but in brazil , people talk a lot more about the beauty of the stadiums , which are shown during bundesliga broadcasts .

are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?

it is well-known that the germans are organizing everything very carefully so brazilians are looking favorably on the world cup preparations . safety is always a topic of discussion at major events , but in brazil , people talk a lot more about the beauty of the stadiums , which are shown during bundesliga broadcasts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 eastern europe draws veil of silence over communist past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in hungary would rather not lift the lid on informer subterfuge with a number of high-profile hungarians recently named as former secret-police informers , calls for a look at the country 's past have been getting louder .
but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .
" not five years ago - 50 !
i was arrested with two school friends , and we were questioned for three days and nights .
eventually i was forced to sign a statement saying i would work with the secret police . " faci n g the demo n s the pervasive presence of informers and collaborators during the communist era is an issue that has never been addressed at a political level in hungary .
even so , it 's a skeleton in the closet of public consciousness that refuses to go away . andras gervai , a historian from budapest , insists that the country needs to face its demons . " it can become very problematic when a country fails to reflect on its past , " he said .
" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .

but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .

even so , it 's a skeleton in the closet of public consciousness that refuses to go away . andras gervai , a historian from budapest , insists that the country needs to face its demons . " it can become very problematic when a country fails to reflect on its past , " he said .
" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .
" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '
and post-1989 , he was the conscience of the nation . " but in fact , szabo met with broad understanding rather than outrage , while gervai received an avalanche of threat letters and indignation that he had gone public with the case .
it was obvious to him what the hungarian people would have preferred to happen : " if szabo had ever meant anything to me then i would have destroyed his file when i came across it in the archives and prevented it from ever reaching the public , " he said , describing the main response his findings have elicited . no soul-searchi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviet tanks in prague in 1968 unlike germany and the czech republic , which opened up police files in the early 1990s , hungary waited until 1997 to allow its citizens to apply for access to their files in the secret police archives . but the new law failed to usher in an era of soul-searching - not least because the archive is only required to release files it decides do not represent a threat to national security . the result is that only selective files get published , usually for reasons of political expedience , such as during election campaigns . to some , a complete opening of the archives would amount to laying the cards on the table and might prevent files being used as political tools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 no deal in eu-iran nuclear talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials are not too hopeful that friday 's talks will end the crisis last-minute negotiations between iran and germany , britain and france failed to produce an agreement in the ongoing nuclear crisis .
time is running out to find a solution before the issue goes to the security council . " unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement today , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters after talks between france , britain , germany and iran in vienna ended after just two hours . iran had called for the last-minute meeting with the eu representatives ahead of a scheduled session with the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on monday .
the un watchdog is to make an assessment of iran 's nuclear program that will then be sent to the un security council for deliberation over possible punitive action such as sanctions . racing against the clock " time is running out , " steinmeier said after the talks in vienna with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani failed to bring improvement .
" if we want success we have to act now , " he added . the german foreign minister regretted that although the talks " were carried out in a constructive atmosphere " they were unable to reach agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani prior to the meeting there had appeared little room for compromise , with tehran insisting on its right to enrich uranium and europe and the united states saying iran must give up the process , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atomic bomb material . " unfortunately , we could not obtain an agreement with mr. larijani , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said following the talks at the german ambassador 's residence in vienna . also present at the hurriedly-arranged meeting , which had been requested by larijani , was european union foreign policy chief javier solana and a british official representing foreign minister jack straw , who was ill . eu demands full cooperation earlier this week the eu troika warned tehran in writing that progress was totally dependent on iran stopping uranium enrichment and cooperating with un nuclear inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani with javier solana " anything short of this would result in a public disagreement , which would set back our shared objectives , " according to a letter from the trio 's foreign ministers and solana obtained by afp . the united states had also voiced skepticism about the prospects of success of friday 's talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.03.2006 opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling rules are not for the faint-hearted germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .
politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language .

yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language .

but for robert hoyzer , the german soccer referee whose name is synonymous with the phrase " betting scandal , " shape certainly does . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv appearances gave way to court appearances for the crooked ref in january 2005 , hoyzer , then a 25-year-old referee , definitively burnt his bridges with german soccer when he confessed to fixing matches on behalf of a croatian betting ring . in what turned out to be germany 's biggest football scandal since the 1970s , hoyzer is said to have taken home 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,900 -rrb- and a wide-screen tv in exchange for making game-influencing calls in dozens of matches .
in the end , however , hoyzer 's hubris earned him more than just money and electronics .
he also got a lifetime ban from the game , and a two year , five month prison sentence , currently under appeal . that other football ... after considering his options , it seems the soccer pariah decided his best chance of salvaging his career lay in an american sport that is , to put it mildly , little known in europe .
you know .
that other football . hozyer has begun training to be a place kicker with the berlin adlers , an american football team that plays in germany 's american football league .
he told news agencies he hopes to sign a contract in time for the new season , in april , when berlin will face off against dresden . " i have been training with the team for a week and hope to be able to sign a contract within the next few weeks , " hoyzer told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the not ready for prime time players ?
berlin thunder v. frankfurt galaxy in a comment that seemed to indicate he has at last got the knack for honesty , hoyzer addressed the downward slide that left him looking for a way to crawl up from the rock-bottom of germany 's sporting heap . " i do not have a future in -lrb- german -rrb- football and have considered how best to use my abilities , " he said . so far , hoyzer has not commented on how it feels to move from a sport that is - by a very wide margin - the most popular and prestigious one in europe , to one that is little understood and even less respected . fall from grace american football players in germany tend to be either professionals who are past their prime and want to make some extra money on the euro circuit , or youngsters who have n't yet made it in to the us national football league but have n't given up their hopes of doing so . some previous german soccer pros , like axel kruse , manfred burgsmüller and ingo anderbrügg , have made the switch to american football .
but none of them has done it under the same cloud of notoriety as hoyzer . if the ex-referee really plans to get along with his american teammates , he may want to start working on his american english idioms .
football phrases like " first down and 10 to go , " " do it for the gipper , " and " hail mary " might come in handy - along with the old schoolyard standard " cheaters never prosper .

2004 of manslaughter and given an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for slaughtering and consuming a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin at his home in the central german town of rotenburg and videotaping the act .
meiwes had met his victim on the internet after he advertised for someone willing to be eaten . a federal tribunal last april upheld an appeal lodged by state prosecutors , calling the verdict too lenient , and ordered a new trial which began in january .
prosecutors are seeking a life sentence . based on real-life events the hollywood thriller tells the tale of fictional american criminal psychology student katie -lrb- keri russell -rrb- who is drawn in by the bizarre case of a meiwes-like character called oliver hartwin . much like meiwes ' life , the cannibal plot of the movie shows a younger hartwin as a loner forced by an overbearing mother to wear lederhosen at school .
like meiwes , he dreams up an imaginary friend . later , as a computer repairman - meiwes 's own profession - the film-character is drawn to the " cannibal cantina " web site in his search for a willing victim . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal back on trial armin meiwes , the self-confessed german cannibal convicted of killing a man , began his retrial on murder charges thursday in frankfurt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 us-india nuclear pact - a double standard ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh sealed the atomic deal on thursday europe 's newspapers on friday were critical of the us-india pact in which washington effectively recognizes delhi 's right to develop nuclear weapons . " after the military 's nuclear tests in 1998 at the latest , india was isolated on the nuclear policy front and dealing with sanctions - from the government and congress in washington in order to quell the spread of nuclear weapons , " wrote germany 's conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" in the past year , bush all but recognized india as a nuclear power - for strategic and economic reasons as well as recognizing the facts .
and he suggested nuclear cooperation if india were to subject its civilian nuclear facilities to international controls .
the leadership in delhi has now largely agreed to that .
that 's no small thing for an elite with a great need for prestige and a state that has n't joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . "
" it 's already clear that globalization constantly generates unique ironies , " wrote liberal austrian daily der standard .
" the new nuclear pact that the us president agreed on with indian prime minister manmohan singh may indeed serve the long-term aim of increasing independence from oil .
but it also comes at a strategic cost : the chinese will be just as mistrustful of the newly declared indian-american friendship as pakistan , not to mention iran . " " it 's understandable and natural that democracies like india and the us come closer , " said sweden 's liberal daily dagens nyheter .
" one can also argue in favor of the pact on nuclear power sealed during president bush 's visit . … still , the matter is somewhat disturbing .
india has not signed the npt .
now signals are being sent that , in the final analysis , threaten all the work done to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . … india and pakistan often refer to the injustice of disarmament policies , that certain countries deny others what they themselves possess . … now , at worst , history could repeat itself . " " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .
and it sends a message to nuclear wannabes like north korea or iran that the us government will only withhold nuclear weapon technology from regimes that do n't suit it .
the obvious double standard belies the superpower 's claim to moral leadership .
the us president must be prepared for accusations that the half-baked nuclear deal undermines the architecture of global security . " " by signing this historic pact with india , bush killed two birds with one stone , " wrote french daily liberation .
" the aim is to compensate the 21st century 's most important geo-strategic upheaval .
india has the same trump cards as china : dynamic population development , the will to develop , technical abilities and the natural ambitions of a very old civilization can make it the world 's third-biggest economic power in a few decades .
india also has trump cards that china does n't have : civil rights , the rule of law , a democratic tradition , a decentralized system and a broad middle class that is open to the - above all english-speaking - world . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?

it is well-known that the germans are organizing everything very carefully so brazilians are looking favorably on the world cup preparations . safety is always a topic of discussion at major events , but in brazil , people talk a lot more about the beauty of the stadiums , which are shown during bundesliga broadcasts .

what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?

2004 of manslaughter and given an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for slaughtering and consuming a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin at his home in the central german town of rotenburg and videotaping the act .
meiwes had met his victim on the internet after he advertised for someone willing to be eaten . a federal tribunal last april upheld an appeal lodged by state prosecutors , calling the verdict too lenient , and ordered a new trial which began in january .
prosecutors are seeking a life sentence . based on real-life events the hollywood thriller tells the tale of fictional american criminal psychology student katie -lrb- keri russell -rrb- who is drawn in by the bizarre case of a meiwes-like character called oliver hartwin . much like meiwes ' life , the cannibal plot of the movie shows a younger hartwin as a loner forced by an overbearing mother to wear lederhosen at school .

" after the military 's nuclear tests in 1998 at the latest , india was isolated on the nuclear policy front and dealing with sanctions - from the government and congress in washington in order to quell the spread of nuclear weapons , " wrote germany 's conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" in the past year , bush all but recognized india as a nuclear power - for strategic and economic reasons as well as recognizing the facts .
and he suggested nuclear cooperation if india were to subject its civilian nuclear facilities to international controls .
the leadership in delhi has now largely agreed to that .
that 's no small thing for an elite with a great need for prestige and a state that has n't joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . "
" it 's already clear that globalization constantly generates unique ironies , " wrote liberal austrian daily der standard .
" the new nuclear pact that the us president agreed on with indian prime minister manmohan singh may indeed serve the long-term aim of increasing independence from oil .
but it also comes at a strategic cost : the chinese will be just as mistrustful of the newly declared indian-american friendship as pakistan , not to mention iran . " " it 's understandable and natural that democracies like india and the us come closer , " said sweden 's liberal daily dagens nyheter .
" one can also argue in favor of the pact on nuclear power sealed during president bush 's visit . … still , the matter is somewhat disturbing .
india has not signed the npt .
now signals are being sent that , in the final analysis , threaten all the work done to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . … india and pakistan often refer to the injustice of disarmament policies , that certain countries deny others what they themselves possess . … now , at worst , history could repeat itself . " " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .
and it sends a message to nuclear wannabes like north korea or iran that the us government will only withhold nuclear weapon technology from regimes that do n't suit it .
the obvious double standard belies the superpower 's claim to moral leadership .
the us president must be prepared for accusations that the half-baked nuclear deal undermines the architecture of global security . " " by signing this historic pact with india , bush killed two birds with one stone , " wrote french daily liberation .
" the aim is to compensate the 21st century 's most important geo-strategic upheaval .
india has the same trump cards as china : dynamic population development , the will to develop , technical abilities and the natural ambitions of a very old civilization can make it the world 's third-biggest economic power in a few decades .
india also has trump cards that china does n't have : civil rights , the rule of law , a democratic tradition , a decentralized system and a broad middle class that is open to the - above all english-speaking - world . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .

2004 of manslaughter and given an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for slaughtering and consuming a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin at his home in the central german town of rotenburg and videotaping the act .
meiwes had met his victim on the internet after he advertised for someone willing to be eaten . a federal tribunal last april upheld an appeal lodged by state prosecutors , calling the verdict too lenient , and ordered a new trial which began in january .
prosecutors are seeking a life sentence . based on real-life events the hollywood thriller tells the tale of fictional american criminal psychology student katie -lrb- keri russell -rrb- who is drawn in by the bizarre case of a meiwes-like character called oliver hartwin . much like meiwes ' life , the cannibal plot of the movie shows a younger hartwin as a loner forced by an overbearing mother to wear lederhosen at school .
like meiwes , he dreams up an imaginary friend . later , as a computer repairman - meiwes 's own profession - the film-character is drawn to the " cannibal cantina " web site in his search for a willing victim . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal back on trial armin meiwes , the self-confessed german cannibal convicted of killing a man , began his retrial on murder charges thursday in frankfurt .

but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .

even so , it 's a skeleton in the closet of public consciousness that refuses to go away . andras gervai , a historian from budapest , insists that the country needs to face its demons . " it can become very problematic when a country fails to reflect on its past , " he said .
" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .
" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 us-india nuclear pact - a double standard ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh sealed the atomic deal on thursday europe 's newspapers on friday were critical of the us-india pact in which washington effectively recognizes delhi 's right to develop nuclear weapons . " after the military 's nuclear tests in 1998 at the latest , india was isolated on the nuclear policy front and dealing with sanctions - from the government and congress in washington in order to quell the spread of nuclear weapons , " wrote germany 's conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" in the past year , bush all but recognized india as a nuclear power - for strategic and economic reasons as well as recognizing the facts .
and he suggested nuclear cooperation if india were to subject its civilian nuclear facilities to international controls .
the leadership in delhi has now largely agreed to that .
that 's no small thing for an elite with a great need for prestige and a state that has n't joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . "
" it 's already clear that globalization constantly generates unique ironies , " wrote liberal austrian daily der standard .
" the new nuclear pact that the us president agreed on with indian prime minister manmohan singh may indeed serve the long-term aim of increasing independence from oil .
but it also comes at a strategic cost : the chinese will be just as mistrustful of the newly declared indian-american friendship as pakistan , not to mention iran . " " it 's understandable and natural that democracies like india and the us come closer , " said sweden 's liberal daily dagens nyheter .
" one can also argue in favor of the pact on nuclear power sealed during president bush 's visit . … still , the matter is somewhat disturbing .
india has not signed the npt .
now signals are being sent that , in the final analysis , threaten all the work done to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . … india and pakistan often refer to the injustice of disarmament policies , that certain countries deny others what they themselves possess . … now , at worst , history could repeat itself . " " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .
and it sends a message to nuclear wannabes like north korea or iran that the us government will only withhold nuclear weapon technology from regimes that do n't suit it .
the obvious double standard belies the superpower 's claim to moral leadership .
the us president must be prepared for accusations that the half-baked nuclear deal undermines the architecture of global security . " " by signing this historic pact with india , bush killed two birds with one stone , " wrote french daily liberation .
" the aim is to compensate the 21st century 's most important geo-strategic upheaval .
india has the same trump cards as china : dynamic population development , the will to develop , technical abilities and the natural ambitions of a very old civilization can make it the world 's third-biggest economic power in a few decades .
india also has trump cards that china does n't have : civil rights , the rule of law , a democratic tradition , a decentralized system and a broad middle class that is open to the - above all english-speaking - world . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

2004 of manslaughter and given an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for slaughtering and consuming a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin at his home in the central german town of rotenburg and videotaping the act .
meiwes had met his victim on the internet after he advertised for someone willing to be eaten . a federal tribunal last april upheld an appeal lodged by state prosecutors , calling the verdict too lenient , and ordered a new trial which began in january .
prosecutors are seeking a life sentence . based on real-life events the hollywood thriller tells the tale of fictional american criminal psychology student katie -lrb- keri russell -rrb- who is drawn in by the bizarre case of a meiwes-like character called oliver hartwin . much like meiwes ' life , the cannibal plot of the movie shows a younger hartwin as a loner forced by an overbearing mother to wear lederhosen at school .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 no deal in eu-iran nuclear talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials are not too hopeful that friday 's talks will end the crisis last-minute negotiations between iran and germany , britain and france failed to produce an agreement in the ongoing nuclear crisis .
time is running out to find a solution before the issue goes to the security council . " unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement today , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters after talks between france , britain , germany and iran in vienna ended after just two hours . iran had called for the last-minute meeting with the eu representatives ahead of a scheduled session with the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on monday .
the un watchdog is to make an assessment of iran 's nuclear program that will then be sent to the un security council for deliberation over possible punitive action such as sanctions . racing against the clock " time is running out , " steinmeier said after the talks in vienna with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani failed to bring improvement .
" if we want success we have to act now , " he added . the german foreign minister regretted that although the talks " were carried out in a constructive atmosphere " they were unable to reach agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani prior to the meeting there had appeared little room for compromise , with tehran insisting on its right to enrich uranium and europe and the united states saying iran must give up the process , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atomic bomb material . " unfortunately , we could not obtain an agreement with mr. larijani , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said following the talks at the german ambassador 's residence in vienna . also present at the hurriedly-arranged meeting , which had been requested by larijani , was european union foreign policy chief javier solana and a british official representing foreign minister jack straw , who was ill . eu demands full cooperation earlier this week the eu troika warned tehran in writing that progress was totally dependent on iran stopping uranium enrichment and cooperating with un nuclear inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani with javier solana " anything short of this would result in a public disagreement , which would set back our shared objectives , " according to a letter from the trio 's foreign ministers and solana obtained by afp . the united states had also voiced skepticism about the prospects of success of friday 's talks .
" we 're under no illusions , " us state department deputy spokesman adam ereli said in washington . talks with moscow fail larijani had arrived in vienna after talks in moscow also failed to produce an agreement on a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil - thus giving tehran the fuel it needs but not the technology . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said friday that a deal with iran on its nuclear enrichment program was still possible before the march 6 meeting of the iaea , the interfax news agency reported .
" there always is an opportunity to reach an agreement , " interfax quoted lavrov as saying in response to a question about whether it was still possible to negotiate an agreement with iran preventing its referral to the un security council at monday 's meeting of the atomic watchdog . security council action pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's meeting hall in vienna the iaea had initially on february 4 reported iran to the un security council but allowed a month for diplomacy before the world body decides what measures , if any , to take against tehran . the iaea has consistently called on iran to suspend uranium enrichment as a confidence-building measure .
but the islamic republic last month fed a 10-centrifuge research cascade at a facility in natanz with the feedstock uranium gas , signaling it was pushing ahead with enrichment it says is essential for a civilian energy program . in a report earlier this week , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said iran had failed to answer crucial questions about its nuclear program after three years of iaea investigations , although he stopped short of saying tehran was making atomic weapons . earlier eu talks with iran - aimed at promising tehran trade and security benefits in return for guarantees it is not seeking to acquire atomic weapons - had been torpedoed by the islamic republic 's insistence on enrichment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ties iran moratorium to joint enrichment deal as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .

time is running out to find a solution before the issue goes to the security council . " unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement today , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters after talks between france , britain , germany and iran in vienna ended after just two hours . iran had called for the last-minute meeting with the eu representatives ahead of a scheduled session with the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on monday .
the un watchdog is to make an assessment of iran 's nuclear program that will then be sent to the un security council for deliberation over possible punitive action such as sanctions . racing against the clock " time is running out , " steinmeier said after the talks in vienna with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani failed to bring improvement .
" if we want success we have to act now , " he added . the german foreign minister regretted that although the talks " were carried out in a constructive atmosphere " they were unable to reach agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani prior to the meeting there had appeared little room for compromise , with tehran insisting on its right to enrich uranium and europe and the united states saying iran must give up the process , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atomic bomb material . " unfortunately , we could not obtain an agreement with mr. larijani , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said following the talks at the german ambassador 's residence in vienna . also present at the hurriedly-arranged meeting , which had been requested by larijani , was european union foreign policy chief javier solana and a british official representing foreign minister jack straw , who was ill . eu demands full cooperation earlier this week the eu troika warned tehran in writing that progress was totally dependent on iran stopping uranium enrichment and cooperating with un nuclear inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani with javier solana " anything short of this would result in a public disagreement , which would set back our shared objectives , " according to a letter from the trio 's foreign ministers and solana obtained by afp . the united states had also voiced skepticism about the prospects of success of friday 's talks .
" we 're under no illusions , " us state department deputy spokesman adam ereli said in washington . talks with moscow fail larijani had arrived in vienna after talks in moscow also failed to produce an agreement on a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil - thus giving tehran the fuel it needs but not the technology . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said friday that a deal with iran on its nuclear enrichment program was still possible before the march 6 meeting of the iaea , the interfax news agency reported .
" there always is an opportunity to reach an agreement , " interfax quoted lavrov as saying in response to a question about whether it was still possible to negotiate an agreement with iran preventing its referral to the un security council at monday 's meeting of the atomic watchdog . security council action pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's meeting hall in vienna the iaea had initially on february 4 reported iran to the un security council but allowed a month for diplomacy before the world body decides what measures , if any , to take against tehran . the iaea has consistently called on iran to suspend uranium enrichment as a confidence-building measure .
but the islamic republic last month fed a 10-centrifuge research cascade at a facility in natanz with the feedstock uranium gas , signaling it was pushing ahead with enrichment it says is essential for a civilian energy program . in a report earlier this week , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said iran had failed to answer crucial questions about its nuclear program after three years of iaea investigations , although he stopped short of saying tehran was making atomic weapons . earlier eu talks with iran - aimed at promising tehran trade and security benefits in return for guarantees it is not seeking to acquire atomic weapons - had been torpedoed by the islamic republic 's insistence on enrichment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ties iran moratorium to joint enrichment deal as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .

time is running out to find a solution before the issue goes to the security council . " unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement today , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters after talks between france , britain , germany and iran in vienna ended after just two hours . iran had called for the last-minute meeting with the eu representatives ahead of a scheduled session with the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on monday .
the un watchdog is to make an assessment of iran 's nuclear program that will then be sent to the un security council for deliberation over possible punitive action such as sanctions . racing against the clock " time is running out , " steinmeier said after the talks in vienna with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani failed to bring improvement .

" unfortunately , we could not obtain an agreement with mr. larijani , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said following the talks at the german ambassador 's residence in vienna . also present at the hurriedly-arranged meeting , which had been requested by larijani , was european union foreign policy chief javier solana and a british official representing foreign minister jack straw , who was ill . eu demands full cooperation earlier this week the eu troika warned tehran in writing that progress was totally dependent on iran stopping uranium enrichment and cooperating with un nuclear inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani with javier solana " anything short of this would result in a public disagreement , which would set back our shared objectives , " according to a letter from the trio 's foreign ministers and solana obtained by afp . the united states had also voiced skepticism about the prospects of success of friday 's talks .

but the islamic republic last month fed a 10-centrifuge research cascade at a facility in natanz with the feedstock uranium gas , signaling it was pushing ahead with enrichment it says is essential for a civilian energy program . in a report earlier this week , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said iran had failed to answer crucial questions about its nuclear program after three years of iaea investigations , although he stopped short of saying tehran was making atomic weapons . earlier eu talks with iran - aimed at promising tehran trade and security benefits in return for guarantees it is not seeking to acquire atomic weapons - had been torpedoed by the islamic republic 's insistence on enrichment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ties iran moratorium to joint enrichment deal as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .

but for robert hoyzer , the german soccer referee whose name is synonymous with the phrase " betting scandal , " shape certainly does . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv appearances gave way to court appearances for the crooked ref in january 2005 , hoyzer , then a 25-year-old referee , definitively burnt his bridges with german soccer when he confessed to fixing matches on behalf of a croatian betting ring . in what turned out to be germany 's biggest football scandal since the 1970s , hoyzer is said to have taken home 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,900 -rrb- and a wide-screen tv in exchange for making game-influencing calls in dozens of matches .
in the end , however , hoyzer 's hubris earned him more than just money and electronics .
he also got a lifetime ban from the game , and a two year , five month prison sentence , currently under appeal . that other football ... after considering his options , it seems the soccer pariah decided his best chance of salvaging his career lay in an american sport that is , to put it mildly , little known in europe .
you know .
that other football . hozyer has begun training to be a place kicker with the berlin adlers , an american football team that plays in germany 's american football league .
he told news agencies he hopes to sign a contract in time for the new season , in april , when berlin will face off against dresden . " i have been training with the team for a week and hope to be able to sign a contract within the next few weeks , " hoyzer told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the not ready for prime time players ?
berlin thunder v. frankfurt galaxy in a comment that seemed to indicate he has at last got the knack for honesty , hoyzer addressed the downward slide that left him looking for a way to crawl up from the rock-bottom of germany 's sporting heap . " i do not have a future in -lrb- german -rrb- football and have considered how best to use my abilities , " he said . so far , hoyzer has not commented on how it feels to move from a sport that is - by a very wide margin - the most popular and prestigious one in europe , to one that is little understood and even less respected . fall from grace american football players in germany tend to be either professionals who are past their prime and want to make some extra money on the euro circuit , or youngsters who have n't yet made it in to the us national football league but have n't given up their hopes of doing so . some previous german soccer pros , like axel kruse , manfred burgsmüller and ingo anderbrügg , have made the switch to american football .
but none of them has done it under the same cloud of notoriety as hoyzer . if the ex-referee really plans to get along with his american teammates , he may want to start working on his american english idioms .
football phrases like " first down and 10 to go , " " do it for the gipper , " and " hail mary " might come in handy - along with the old schoolyard standard " cheaters never prosper .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .

the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .

" not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language .

germany has asked the us for more information about an alleged secret plan by saddam hussein to defend baghdad before the war after a us paper reported its spies had passed it on to american forces . this week the new york times reported that german intelligence agents had obtained a copy of the plan and passed it on to the us weeks before the invasion . the report , which germany has vehemently denied , has triggered huge controversy and calls for a parliamentary inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper report has caused an uproar in germany on friday , germany still stuck to its denial but a government spokesman said berlin had asked washington for more details about the affair .
the german government is hoping in particularly that the us can shed light on the classified military study on which the times report was based and whether it included a sketch map that was printed by the paper . " we have renewed our request to the american side and expressed the wish : if you can , give us the information whether such a secret study exists , is there a study with sketches , where do you believe such a sketch came from ? "
steg said . he added that german authorities were currently in contact with several us officials to find out what the " alleged secret military study " was all about . steg , much like germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , reiterated that there was no direct contact between its agents in baghdad and us authorities . no aid i n selecti n g bombi n g targets germany , under former chancellor gerhard schröder , vocally opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
but a series of revelations in recent weeks has raised uncomfortable questions about its exact role in the war . a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , parts of which were released to the public , underlined that german intelligence agents in iraq mainly supplied information on civilian sites that the americans should avoid bombing . berlin has also admitted that its spies provided descriptions of the iraqi military and police presence in baghdad , but has strongly rejected allegations that the information was used to select bombing targets . doubts about authe n ticity of sketch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein on friday steg stressed that the german government was n't aware of the secret saddam hussein defense plan and thus could n't have passed it to washington . " you ca n't pass on something that you do n't know , " steg said . steg also raised doubts over the authenticity of the diagram printed in the new york times . " i do n't honestly know if a city of many millions of people like baghdad could develop a defense concept on the basis of such a sketch , " he said .
" i have the greatest doubts . " parliame n tary probe ? the report is expected to be discussed at a meeting next monday of the german parliamentary committee in charge of monitoring the secret services . the outcome of the meeting will decide the fate of a parliamentary probe that the opposition greens and left party are pushing for .

time is running out to find a solution before the issue goes to the security council . " unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement today , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters after talks between france , britain , germany and iran in vienna ended after just two hours . iran had called for the last-minute meeting with the eu representatives ahead of a scheduled session with the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on monday .

but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .
" not five years ago - 50 !
i was arrested with two school friends , and we were questioned for three days and nights .
eventually i was forced to sign a statement saying i would work with the secret police . " faci n g the demo n s the pervasive presence of informers and collaborators during the communist era is an issue that has never been addressed at a political level in hungary .
even so , it 's a skeleton in the closet of public consciousness that refuses to go away . andras gervai , a historian from budapest , insists that the country needs to face its demons . " it can become very problematic when a country fails to reflect on its past , " he said .
" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .
" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '
and post-1989 , he was the conscience of the nation . " but in fact , szabo met with broad understanding rather than outrage , while gervai received an avalanche of threat letters and indignation that he had gone public with the case .
it was obvious to him what the hungarian people would have preferred to happen : " if szabo had ever meant anything to me then i would have destroyed his file when i came across it in the archives and prevented it from ever reaching the public , " he said , describing the main response his findings have elicited . no soul-searchi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviet tanks in prague in 1968 unlike germany and the czech republic , which opened up police files in the early 1990s , hungary waited until 1997 to allow its citizens to apply for access to their files in the secret police archives . but the new law failed to usher in an era of soul-searching - not least because the archive is only required to release files it decides do not represent a threat to national security . the result is that only selective files get published , usually for reasons of political expedience , such as during election campaigns . to some , a complete opening of the archives would amount to laying the cards on the table and might prevent files being used as political tools .
but others feel it would be counter-productive . " there are so many people who can no longer defend themselves , " szabo said .
" these are people with a lifetime behind them , and they 're being slandered for political ends .
and they can not tell their side of the story . " political observers believe that not only former communists have a vested interest in keeping the files under lock and key - they believe that parliamentary parties across the board see the hungarian people 's reluctance to banish the ghosts of the last few decades as a natural turning away from the past . but given that some 150,000 hungarians are thought to have collaborated with the secret police , it seems likely that those ghosts will catch up with the public soon . harriett ferenci -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary to open spy files making an about-turn , hungary 's ruling socialist party said on wednesday that it now backed fully opening communist-era secret service files , in an attempt to confront the country 's ghosts of the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.03.2006 opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling rules are not for the faint-hearted germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .
politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .
and it is in the department of old habits that germany is showing its greatest weakness . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spelling divide as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .

" after the military 's nuclear tests in 1998 at the latest , india was isolated on the nuclear policy front and dealing with sanctions - from the government and congress in washington in order to quell the spread of nuclear weapons , " wrote germany 's conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" in the past year , bush all but recognized india as a nuclear power - for strategic and economic reasons as well as recognizing the facts .
and he suggested nuclear cooperation if india were to subject its civilian nuclear facilities to international controls .
the leadership in delhi has now largely agreed to that .
that 's no small thing for an elite with a great need for prestige and a state that has n't joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . "
" it 's already clear that globalization constantly generates unique ironies , " wrote liberal austrian daily der standard .
" the new nuclear pact that the us president agreed on with indian prime minister manmohan singh may indeed serve the long-term aim of increasing independence from oil .
but it also comes at a strategic cost : the chinese will be just as mistrustful of the newly declared indian-american friendship as pakistan , not to mention iran . " " it 's understandable and natural that democracies like india and the us come closer , " said sweden 's liberal daily dagens nyheter .
" one can also argue in favor of the pact on nuclear power sealed during president bush 's visit . … still , the matter is somewhat disturbing .
india has not signed the npt .
now signals are being sent that , in the final analysis , threaten all the work done to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . … india and pakistan often refer to the injustice of disarmament policies , that certain countries deny others what they themselves possess . … now , at worst , history could repeat itself . " " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .
and it sends a message to nuclear wannabes like north korea or iran that the us government will only withhold nuclear weapon technology from regimes that do n't suit it .
the obvious double standard belies the superpower 's claim to moral leadership .
the us president must be prepared for accusations that the half-baked nuclear deal undermines the architecture of global security . " " by signing this historic pact with india , bush killed two birds with one stone , " wrote french daily liberation .
" the aim is to compensate the 21st century 's most important geo-strategic upheaval .
india has the same trump cards as china : dynamic population development , the will to develop , technical abilities and the natural ambitions of a very old civilization can make it the world 's third-biggest economic power in a few decades .
india also has trump cards that china does n't have : civil rights , the rule of law , a democratic tradition , a decentralized system and a broad middle class that is open to the - above all english-speaking - world . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 no deal in eu-iran nuclear talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials are not too hopeful that friday 's talks will end the crisis last-minute negotiations between iran and germany , britain and france failed to produce an agreement in the ongoing nuclear crisis .
time is running out to find a solution before the issue goes to the security council . " unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement today , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters after talks between france , britain , germany and iran in vienna ended after just two hours . iran had called for the last-minute meeting with the eu representatives ahead of a scheduled session with the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- on monday .
the un watchdog is to make an assessment of iran 's nuclear program that will then be sent to the un security council for deliberation over possible punitive action such as sanctions . racing against the clock " time is running out , " steinmeier said after the talks in vienna with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani failed to bring improvement .
" if we want success we have to act now , " he added . the german foreign minister regretted that although the talks " were carried out in a constructive atmosphere " they were unable to reach agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani prior to the meeting there had appeared little room for compromise , with tehran insisting on its right to enrich uranium and europe and the united states saying iran must give up the process , which makes nuclear reactor fuel but also atomic bomb material . " unfortunately , we could not obtain an agreement with mr. larijani , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said following the talks at the german ambassador 's residence in vienna . also present at the hurriedly-arranged meeting , which had been requested by larijani , was european union foreign policy chief javier solana and a british official representing foreign minister jack straw , who was ill . eu demands full cooperation earlier this week the eu troika warned tehran in writing that progress was totally dependent on iran stopping uranium enrichment and cooperating with un nuclear inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani with javier solana " anything short of this would result in a public disagreement , which would set back our shared objectives , " according to a letter from the trio 's foreign ministers and solana obtained by afp . the united states had also voiced skepticism about the prospects of success of friday 's talks .
" we 're under no illusions , " us state department deputy spokesman adam ereli said in washington . talks with moscow fail larijani had arrived in vienna after talks in moscow also failed to produce an agreement on a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil - thus giving tehran the fuel it needs but not the technology . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said friday that a deal with iran on its nuclear enrichment program was still possible before the march 6 meeting of the iaea , the interfax news agency reported .
" there always is an opportunity to reach an agreement , " interfax quoted lavrov as saying in response to a question about whether it was still possible to negotiate an agreement with iran preventing its referral to the un security council at monday 's meeting of the atomic watchdog . security council action pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's meeting hall in vienna the iaea had initially on february 4 reported iran to the un security council but allowed a month for diplomacy before the world body decides what measures , if any , to take against tehran . the iaea has consistently called on iran to suspend uranium enrichment as a confidence-building measure .
but the islamic republic last month fed a 10-centrifuge research cascade at a facility in natanz with the feedstock uranium gas , signaling it was pushing ahead with enrichment it says is essential for a civilian energy program . in a report earlier this week , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said iran had failed to answer crucial questions about its nuclear program after three years of iaea investigations , although he stopped short of saying tehran was making atomic weapons . earlier eu talks with iran - aimed at promising tehran trade and security benefits in return for guarantees it is not seeking to acquire atomic weapons - had been torpedoed by the islamic republic 's insistence on enrichment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ties iran moratorium to joint enrichment deal as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .

2004 of manslaughter and given an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for slaughtering and consuming a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin at his home in the central german town of rotenburg and videotaping the act .
meiwes had met his victim on the internet after he advertised for someone willing to be eaten . a federal tribunal last april upheld an appeal lodged by state prosecutors , calling the verdict too lenient , and ordered a new trial which began in january .
prosecutors are seeking a life sentence . based on real-life events the hollywood thriller tells the tale of fictional american criminal psychology student katie -lrb- keri russell -rrb- who is drawn in by the bizarre case of a meiwes-like character called oliver hartwin . much like meiwes ' life , the cannibal plot of the movie shows a younger hartwin as a loner forced by an overbearing mother to wear lederhosen at school .
like meiwes , he dreams up an imaginary friend . later , as a computer repairman - meiwes 's own profession - the film-character is drawn to the " cannibal cantina " web site in his search for a willing victim . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal back on trial armin meiwes , the self-confessed german cannibal convicted of killing a man , began his retrial on murder charges thursday in frankfurt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 us-india nuclear pact - a double standard ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and singh sealed the atomic deal on thursday europe 's newspapers on friday were critical of the us-india pact in which washington effectively recognizes delhi 's right to develop nuclear weapons . " after the military 's nuclear tests in 1998 at the latest , india was isolated on the nuclear policy front and dealing with sanctions - from the government and congress in washington in order to quell the spread of nuclear weapons , " wrote germany 's conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" in the past year , bush all but recognized india as a nuclear power - for strategic and economic reasons as well as recognizing the facts .
and he suggested nuclear cooperation if india were to subject its civilian nuclear facilities to international controls .
the leadership in delhi has now largely agreed to that .
that 's no small thing for an elite with a great need for prestige and a state that has n't joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . "
" it 's already clear that globalization constantly generates unique ironies , " wrote liberal austrian daily der standard .
" the new nuclear pact that the us president agreed on with indian prime minister manmohan singh may indeed serve the long-term aim of increasing independence from oil .
but it also comes at a strategic cost : the chinese will be just as mistrustful of the newly declared indian-american friendship as pakistan , not to mention iran . " " it 's understandable and natural that democracies like india and the us come closer , " said sweden 's liberal daily dagens nyheter .
" one can also argue in favor of the pact on nuclear power sealed during president bush 's visit . … still , the matter is somewhat disturbing .
india has not signed the npt .
now signals are being sent that , in the final analysis , threaten all the work done to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . … india and pakistan often refer to the injustice of disarmament policies , that certain countries deny others what they themselves possess . … now , at worst , history could repeat itself . " " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .
and it sends a message to nuclear wannabes like north korea or iran that the us government will only withhold nuclear weapon technology from regimes that do n't suit it .
the obvious double standard belies the superpower 's claim to moral leadership .
the us president must be prepared for accusations that the half-baked nuclear deal undermines the architecture of global security . " " by signing this historic pact with india , bush killed two birds with one stone , " wrote french daily liberation .
" the aim is to compensate the 21st century 's most important geo-strategic upheaval .
india has the same trump cards as china : dynamic population development , the will to develop , technical abilities and the natural ambitions of a very old civilization can make it the world 's third-biggest economic power in a few decades .
india also has trump cards that china does n't have : civil rights , the rule of law , a democratic tradition , a decentralized system and a broad middle class that is open to the - above all english-speaking - world . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .
-lrb- feb .
19 , 2006 -rrb- no deal in eu-iran nuclear talks britain , france and germany have agreed to a last-minute request by tehran for ministerial talks friday ahead of possible un action over western fears that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons .

germany has asked the us for more information about an alleged secret plan by saddam hussein to defend baghdad before the war after a us paper reported its spies had passed it on to american forces . this week the new york times reported that german intelligence agents had obtained a copy of the plan and passed it on to the us weeks before the invasion . the report , which germany has vehemently denied , has triggered huge controversy and calls for a parliamentary inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper report has caused an uproar in germany on friday , germany still stuck to its denial but a government spokesman said berlin had asked washington for more details about the affair .

germany has asked the us for more information about an alleged secret plan by saddam hussein to defend baghdad before the war after a us paper reported its spies had passed it on to american forces . this week the new york times reported that german intelligence agents had obtained a copy of the plan and passed it on to the us weeks before the invasion . the report , which germany has vehemently denied , has triggered huge controversy and calls for a parliamentary inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper report has caused an uproar in germany on friday , germany still stuck to its denial but a government spokesman said berlin had asked washington for more details about the affair .
the german government is hoping in particularly that the us can shed light on the classified military study on which the times report was based and whether it included a sketch map that was printed by the paper . " we have renewed our request to the american side and expressed the wish : if you can , give us the information whether such a secret study exists , is there a study with sketches , where do you believe such a sketch came from ? "
steg said . he added that german authorities were currently in contact with several us officials to find out what the " alleged secret military study " was all about . steg , much like germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , reiterated that there was no direct contact between its agents in baghdad and us authorities . no aid i n selecti n g bombi n g targets germany , under former chancellor gerhard schröder , vocally opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
but a series of revelations in recent weeks has raised uncomfortable questions about its exact role in the war . a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , parts of which were released to the public , underlined that german intelligence agents in iraq mainly supplied information on civilian sites that the americans should avoid bombing . berlin has also admitted that its spies provided descriptions of the iraqi military and police presence in baghdad , but has strongly rejected allegations that the information was used to select bombing targets . doubts about authe n ticity of sketch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein on friday steg stressed that the german government was n't aware of the secret saddam hussein defense plan and thus could n't have passed it to washington . " you ca n't pass on something that you do n't know , " steg said . steg also raised doubts over the authenticity of the diagram printed in the new york times . " i do n't honestly know if a city of many millions of people like baghdad could develop a defense concept on the basis of such a sketch , " he said .
" i have the greatest doubts . " parliame n tary probe ? the report is expected to be discussed at a meeting next monday of the german parliamentary committee in charge of monitoring the secret services . the outcome of the meeting will decide the fate of a parliamentary probe that the opposition greens and left party are pushing for .

but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .

even so , it 's a skeleton in the closet of public consciousness that refuses to go away . andras gervai , a historian from budapest , insists that the country needs to face its demons . " it can become very problematic when a country fails to reflect on its past , " he said .
" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .
" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '

2004 of manslaughter and given an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for slaughtering and consuming a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin at his home in the central german town of rotenburg and videotaping the act .
meiwes had met his victim on the internet after he advertised for someone willing to be eaten . a federal tribunal last april upheld an appeal lodged by state prosecutors , calling the verdict too lenient , and ordered a new trial which began in january .
prosecutors are seeking a life sentence . based on real-life events the hollywood thriller tells the tale of fictional american criminal psychology student katie -lrb- keri russell -rrb- who is drawn in by the bizarre case of a meiwes-like character called oliver hartwin . much like meiwes ' life , the cannibal plot of the movie shows a younger hartwin as a loner forced by an overbearing mother to wear lederhosen at school .

time is running out to find a solution before the issue goes to the security council .

the un watchdog is to make an assessment of iran 's nuclear program that will then be sent to the un security council for deliberation over possible punitive action such as sanctions . racing against the clock " time is running out , " steinmeier said after the talks in vienna with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani failed to bring improvement .

" we 're under no illusions , " us state department deputy spokesman adam ereli said in washington . talks with moscow fail larijani had arrived in vienna after talks in moscow also failed to produce an agreement on a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil - thus giving tehran the fuel it needs but not the technology . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said friday that a deal with iran on its nuclear enrichment program was still possible before the march 6 meeting of the iaea , the interfax news agency reported .
" there always is an opportunity to reach an agreement , " interfax quoted lavrov as saying in response to a question about whether it was still possible to negotiate an agreement with iran preventing its referral to the un security council at monday 's meeting of the atomic watchdog . security council action pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's meeting hall in vienna the iaea had initially on february 4 reported iran to the un security council but allowed a month for diplomacy before the world body decides what measures , if any , to take against tehran . the iaea has consistently called on iran to suspend uranium enrichment as a confidence-building measure .
but the islamic republic last month fed a 10-centrifuge research cascade at a facility in natanz with the feedstock uranium gas , signaling it was pushing ahead with enrichment it says is essential for a civilian energy program . in a report earlier this week , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said iran had failed to answer crucial questions about its nuclear program after three years of iaea investigations , although he stopped short of saying tehran was making atomic weapons . earlier eu talks with iran - aimed at promising tehran trade and security benefits in return for guarantees it is not seeking to acquire atomic weapons - had been torpedoed by the islamic republic 's insistence on enrichment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ties iran moratorium to joint enrichment deal as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .

" we 're under no illusions , " us state department deputy spokesman adam ereli said in washington . talks with moscow fail larijani had arrived in vienna after talks in moscow also failed to produce an agreement on a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil - thus giving tehran the fuel it needs but not the technology . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said friday that a deal with iran on its nuclear enrichment program was still possible before the march 6 meeting of the iaea , the interfax news agency reported .
" there always is an opportunity to reach an agreement , " interfax quoted lavrov as saying in response to a question about whether it was still possible to negotiate an agreement with iran preventing its referral to the un security council at monday 's meeting of the atomic watchdog . security council action pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's meeting hall in vienna the iaea had initially on february 4 reported iran to the un security council but allowed a month for diplomacy before the world body decides what measures , if any , to take against tehran . the iaea has consistently called on iran to suspend uranium enrichment as a confidence-building measure .
but the islamic republic last month fed a 10-centrifuge research cascade at a facility in natanz with the feedstock uranium gas , signaling it was pushing ahead with enrichment it says is essential for a civilian energy program . in a report earlier this week , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said iran had failed to answer crucial questions about its nuclear program after three years of iaea investigations , although he stopped short of saying tehran was making atomic weapons . earlier eu talks with iran - aimed at promising tehran trade and security benefits in return for guarantees it is not seeking to acquire atomic weapons - had been torpedoed by the islamic republic 's insistence on enrichment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ties iran moratorium to joint enrichment deal as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.03.2006 opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling rules are not for the faint-hearted germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .
politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .
and it is in the department of old habits that germany is showing its greatest weakness . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spelling divide as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed .

but latvia , which has fought hard to keep its own language , says no amount of eu rhetoric will change it back from eiro .

germany has asked the us for more information about an alleged secret plan by saddam hussein to defend baghdad before the war after a us paper reported its spies had passed it on to american forces . this week the new york times reported that german intelligence agents had obtained a copy of the plan and passed it on to the us weeks before the invasion . the report , which germany has vehemently denied , has triggered huge controversy and calls for a parliamentary inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper report has caused an uproar in germany on friday , germany still stuck to its denial but a government spokesman said berlin had asked washington for more details about the affair .
the german government is hoping in particularly that the us can shed light on the classified military study on which the times report was based and whether it included a sketch map that was printed by the paper . " we have renewed our request to the american side and expressed the wish : if you can , give us the information whether such a secret study exists , is there a study with sketches , where do you believe such a sketch came from ? "
steg said . he added that german authorities were currently in contact with several us officials to find out what the " alleged secret military study " was all about . steg , much like germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , reiterated that there was no direct contact between its agents in baghdad and us authorities . no aid i n selecti n g bombi n g targets germany , under former chancellor gerhard schröder , vocally opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
but a series of revelations in recent weeks has raised uncomfortable questions about its exact role in the war . a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , parts of which were released to the public , underlined that german intelligence agents in iraq mainly supplied information on civilian sites that the americans should avoid bombing . berlin has also admitted that its spies provided descriptions of the iraqi military and police presence in baghdad , but has strongly rejected allegations that the information was used to select bombing targets . doubts about authe n ticity of sketch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein on friday steg stressed that the german government was n't aware of the secret saddam hussein defense plan and thus could n't have passed it to washington . " you ca n't pass on something that you do n't know , " steg said . steg also raised doubts over the authenticity of the diagram printed in the new york times .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .
and it is in the department of old habits that germany is showing its greatest weakness . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spelling divide as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language .

germany has asked the us for more information about an alleged secret plan by saddam hussein to defend baghdad before the war after a us paper reported its spies had passed it on to american forces . this week the new york times reported that german intelligence agents had obtained a copy of the plan and passed it on to the us weeks before the invasion . the report , which germany has vehemently denied , has triggered huge controversy and calls for a parliamentary inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper report has caused an uproar in germany on friday , germany still stuck to its denial but a government spokesman said berlin had asked washington for more details about the affair .
the german government is hoping in particularly that the us can shed light on the classified military study on which the times report was based and whether it included a sketch map that was printed by the paper . " we have renewed our request to the american side and expressed the wish : if you can , give us the information whether such a secret study exists , is there a study with sketches , where do you believe such a sketch came from ? "
steg said . he added that german authorities were currently in contact with several us officials to find out what the " alleged secret military study " was all about . steg , much like germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , reiterated that there was no direct contact between its agents in baghdad and us authorities . no aid i n selecti n g bombi n g targets germany , under former chancellor gerhard schröder , vocally opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
but a series of revelations in recent weeks has raised uncomfortable questions about its exact role in the war . a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , parts of which were released to the public , underlined that german intelligence agents in iraq mainly supplied information on civilian sites that the americans should avoid bombing . berlin has also admitted that its spies provided descriptions of the iraqi military and police presence in baghdad , but has strongly rejected allegations that the information was used to select bombing targets . doubts about authe n ticity of sketch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein on friday steg stressed that the german government was n't aware of the secret saddam hussein defense plan and thus could n't have passed it to washington . " you ca n't pass on something that you do n't know , " steg said . steg also raised doubts over the authenticity of the diagram printed in the new york times . " i do n't honestly know if a city of many millions of people like baghdad could develop a defense concept on the basis of such a sketch , " he said .
" i have the greatest doubts . " parliame n tary probe ? the report is expected to be discussed at a meeting next monday of the german parliamentary committee in charge of monitoring the secret services . the outcome of the meeting will decide the fate of a parliamentary probe that the opposition greens and left party are pushing for .
the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the largest opposition party , have said they 'll make up their minds after the meeting of the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us newspaper makes new claims of german espionage drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .
and it is in the department of old habits that germany is showing its greatest weakness . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spelling divide as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed .
-lrb- aug 1 , 2005 -rrb- you say euro , i say eiro the european central bank is trying to curb varying spellings of the word euro .
but latvia , which has fought hard to keep its own language , says no amount of eu rhetoric will change it back from eiro .
-lrb- jan 5 , 2006 -rrb- german states back spelling reform while several german publishers recently rejected the country 's six-year-old spelling reform , a clear majority of states intend to stick to the change in schools , according to a news report .

germany has asked the us for more information about an alleged secret plan by saddam hussein to defend baghdad before the war after a us paper reported its spies had passed it on to american forces . this week the new york times reported that german intelligence agents had obtained a copy of the plan and passed it on to the us weeks before the invasion . the report , which germany has vehemently denied , has triggered huge controversy and calls for a parliamentary inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper report has caused an uproar in germany on friday , germany still stuck to its denial but a government spokesman said berlin had asked washington for more details about the affair .
the german government is hoping in particularly that the us can shed light on the classified military study on which the times report was based and whether it included a sketch map that was printed by the paper . " we have renewed our request to the american side and expressed the wish : if you can , give us the information whether such a secret study exists , is there a study with sketches , where do you believe such a sketch came from ? "
steg said . he added that german authorities were currently in contact with several us officials to find out what the " alleged secret military study " was all about . steg , much like germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- , reiterated that there was no direct contact between its agents in baghdad and us authorities . no aid i n selecti n g bombi n g targets germany , under former chancellor gerhard schröder , vocally opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
but a series of revelations in recent weeks has raised uncomfortable questions about its exact role in the war . a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , parts of which were released to the public , underlined that german intelligence agents in iraq mainly supplied information on civilian sites that the americans should avoid bombing . berlin has also admitted that its spies provided descriptions of the iraqi military and police presence in baghdad , but has strongly rejected allegations that the information was used to select bombing targets . doubts about authe n ticity of sketch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein on friday steg stressed that the german government was n't aware of the secret saddam hussein defense plan and thus could n't have passed it to washington .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .
he needs to name his number one goalie - that would calm the goalie as well as the defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a consumer magazine questioned the safety of a number of world cup stadiums how would you assess the orga n izatio n al preparatio n s for the world cup i n germa n y ?

it is well-known that the germans are organizing everything very carefully so brazilians are looking favorably on the world cup preparations . safety is always a topic of discussion at major events , but in brazil , people talk a lot more about the beauty of the stadiums , which are shown during bundesliga broadcasts .

but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .
" not five years ago - 50 !
i was arrested with two school friends , and we were questioned for three days and nights .
eventually i was forced to sign a statement saying i would work with the secret police . " faci n g the demo n s the pervasive presence of informers and collaborators during the communist era is an issue that has never been addressed at a political level in hungary .
even so , it 's a skeleton in the closet of public consciousness that refuses to go away . andras gervai , a historian from budapest , insists that the country needs to face its demons . " it can become very problematic when a country fails to reflect on its past , " he said .
" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .
" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '
and post-1989 , he was the conscience of the nation . " but in fact , szabo met with broad understanding rather than outrage , while gervai received an avalanche of threat letters and indignation that he had gone public with the case .
it was obvious to him what the hungarian people would have preferred to happen : " if szabo had ever meant anything to me then i would have destroyed his file when i came across it in the archives and prevented it from ever reaching the public , " he said , describing the main response his findings have elicited . no soul-searchi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviet tanks in prague in 1968 unlike germany and the czech republic , which opened up police files in the early 1990s , hungary waited until 1997 to allow its citizens to apply for access to their files in the secret police archives . but the new law failed to usher in an era of soul-searching - not least because the archive is only required to release files it decides do not represent a threat to national security . the result is that only selective files get published , usually for reasons of political expedience , such as during election campaigns . to some , a complete opening of the archives would amount to laying the cards on the table and might prevent files being used as political tools .
but others feel it would be counter-productive . " there are so many people who can no longer defend themselves , " szabo said .
" these are people with a lifetime behind them , and they 're being slandered for political ends .
and they can not tell their side of the story . " political observers believe that not only former communists have a vested interest in keeping the files under lock and key - they believe that parliamentary parties across the board see the hungarian people 's reluctance to banish the ghosts of the last few decades as a natural turning away from the past . but given that some 150,000 hungarians are thought to have collaborated with the secret police , it seems likely that those ghosts will catch up with the public soon . harriett ferenci -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hungary to open spy files making an about-turn , hungary 's ruling socialist party said on wednesday that it now backed fully opening communist-era secret service files , in an attempt to confront the country 's ghosts of the past .

" after the military 's nuclear tests in 1998 at the latest , india was isolated on the nuclear policy front and dealing with sanctions - from the government and congress in washington in order to quell the spread of nuclear weapons , " wrote germany 's conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" in the past year , bush all but recognized india as a nuclear power - for strategic and economic reasons as well as recognizing the facts .
and he suggested nuclear cooperation if india were to subject its civilian nuclear facilities to international controls .
the leadership in delhi has now largely agreed to that .
that 's no small thing for an elite with a great need for prestige and a state that has n't joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- . "
" it 's already clear that globalization constantly generates unique ironies , " wrote liberal austrian daily der standard .
" the new nuclear pact that the us president agreed on with indian prime minister manmohan singh may indeed serve the long-term aim of increasing independence from oil .
but it also comes at a strategic cost : the chinese will be just as mistrustful of the newly declared indian-american friendship as pakistan , not to mention iran . " " it 's understandable and natural that democracies like india and the us come closer , " said sweden 's liberal daily dagens nyheter .
" one can also argue in favor of the pact on nuclear power sealed during president bush 's visit . … still , the matter is somewhat disturbing .
india has not signed the npt .
now signals are being sent that , in the final analysis , threaten all the work done to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . … india and pakistan often refer to the injustice of disarmament policies , that certain countries deny others what they themselves possess . … now , at worst , history could repeat itself . " " bush would have earned recognition for taking the initiative if he had n't built the strategic partnership between washington and delhi on the basis of a questionable nuclear pact , " criticized the tages-anzeiger daily in switzerland .
" the bilateral treaty breaks the international rules that are meant to prevent a nuclear armaments race .
it raises india - which consciously did not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaties so it could be free to develop warheads - to the level of a nuclear power .
and it sends a message to nuclear wannabes like north korea or iran that the us government will only withhold nuclear weapon technology from regimes that do n't suit it .
the obvious double standard belies the superpower 's claim to moral leadership .
the us president must be prepared for accusations that the half-baked nuclear deal undermines the architecture of global security . " " by signing this historic pact with india , bush killed two birds with one stone , " wrote french daily liberation .
" the aim is to compensate the 21st century 's most important geo-strategic upheaval .
india has the same trump cards as china : dynamic population development , the will to develop , technical abilities and the natural ambitions of a very old civilization can make it the world 's third-biggest economic power in a few decades .
india also has trump cards that china does n't have : civil rights , the rule of law , a democratic tradition , a decentralized system and a broad middle class that is open to the - above all english-speaking - world . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.03.2006 opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling rules are not for the faint-hearted germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .
politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .

politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes . if a german soccer player gets a yellow card during the world cup this summer , it will be called a " gelbe karte . "
on aug .
1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .

1 , however , three weeks after the end of the championship , that same unwanted gift will become illegal .
that does n't mean that soccer players will be allowed to run amok , take off their shirts and dance the hula-hula , but rather that they will be - in accordance with a new set of german spelling rules - penalized with a " gelbe karte " -lrb- capital g -rrb- instead . germany 's regional culture ministers on thursday called on newspaper editors and book publishers to fall into line behind the newly revised regulations on spelling .
the ministers from the country 's 16 regional states unanimously approved proposals from the german council for spelling , which was given the task of modifying reforms on spelling adopted in 1996 by german-speaking countries . the new set of rules , which , among other things , outlaws the " gelbe karte " with a lower-case " g , " is not only an attempt at pacifying the vocal opponents of the spelling reform , but also a face-saving endeavor for germany 's cultural and political establishment .
above all , it is a barometer of how the country perceives and reacts to change - an important consideration in view of germany 's economic crisis . reform of the reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german school children suffer the most with constant spelling reforms the original spelling reform of 1996 , which was meant to harmonize the spelling rules across the german-speaking countries , turned out to be a major embarrassment if not outright failure . after six years of teaching the new spelling rules , two german states which make up over one-third of germany 's population - bavaria and north rhine-westphalia - decided to throw out both the baby and the bath water and n ot make the new spelling compulsory . one of germany 's major newspapers , the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , and several other press groups turned their back on the 1996 rules , preferring the traditional spelling rules .
german nobel prize winner günter grass stood up against the reforms , and the country found a new national pastime : trashing the writing reform .
organizations such as the german language research group or teachers against the spelling reform launched their impassioned campaigns with the result that in 2004 , 77 percent of germans still considered the spelling reform not sensible . it is truly mind-boggling to an outsider that in a country with an unemployment rate of over five million , spelling rules should stir up so much passion .
it is even more mind-boggling that spelling seems like a more controversial topic than equal access to education , integration policies and german education underachievement in the eu context .
yet it is beyond any doubt that failed reforms , partial reforms and reforms of the reforms can only undermine public trust in their cultural and political institutions . correct me if i 'm wro n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer probably did n't notice the spelling mistakes when he signed the constitution for all their proverbial discipline and meticulousness , many germans are actually sloppy spellers - partly because of the complex capitalization , punctuation and syllabification rules .
harald büssing , a berlin teacher , discovered - for example - that the german constitution had at least two spelling mistakes .
his petition to have the mistakes corrected was rejected by the officials because the mistakes had apparently not caused any problems since the basic law was signed by konrad adenauer , the future first chancellor , on may 23 , 1949 . no sensible teacher would accept a student 's argument that his or her spelling mistakes are causing no problems and should therefore be overlooked .
spelling is a conventional set of rules , and it is definitely not set in stone .
but it requires consistency and should not be changed every few years . german , for its part , is not the most efficient of languages : it needs 11 letters for a surname consisting of only three distinct sounds -lrb- tzschätzsch -rrb- , but the german spelling reform was never that ground-shaking in the first place .
attempts by the institute for the german language and the society for the german language in the late eighties to do away with the complicated capitalization of nouns and make the german spelling more phonetic were never considered even remotely acceptable by the political establishment or the general public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german spelling is - this time , literally - in the soup the reforms ended up being about whether ice-skating -lrb- eislaufen -rrb- should be written as one or two words , and whether " ice " in ice-skating should be capitalized , like most german nouns .
the devil is , surely , in the detail but the new set of proposals is still not guaranteeing pain-free german classes in schools .
according to the new proposal , the act of ice-skating will revert to a single word , despite it being separated into two words in the decree of a decade ago .
however , the experts decided that " rad fahren " , or biking , must remain two words . too little , too late ? the german publisher duden announced that the new rules would be incorporated into the 24th edition of its authoritative spelling dictionary on july 22 . after a public outcry against what the majority of germans saw as pointless and artificial spelling rules , the ministers declared the latest changes to be a victory of common sense .
jan-hendrik olbertz , culture minister of saxony-anhalt , said that " the gordian knot has been cut and perhaps the misery is over . " not everybody , however , was ready to pat the ministers on the shoulder . hans-joachim otto of the german opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called the spelling reform a fiasco and a proof that " the state should not meddle with the language . " please try agai n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german novelist günter grass is one of the most vocal opponents of the spelling reform it 's hard to tell what the chances are of the second reform to succeed where the first one failed .
bavaria and north rhein-westphalia signalized they would make the new spelling rules binding .
last week , the german publisher axel springer verlag announced it was considering abandoning the old spelling rules that it demonstratively readopted in 2004 . the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g , which went back to the old spelling in 2000 , is also considering the new compromise recommendations , but will wait for the new spelling dictionaries to come out . " we will see if they are more useful than the last editions and whether there would still be so many discrepancies between the dictionaries , " said faz editor hubert spiegel . angela merkel 's government will directly benefit from the recent developments : according to the revised spelling rules , " grand coalition " will be capitalized as " grosse koalition , " adding an orthographic sense of grandeur to a bipartisan marriage of convenience . but the overall course of the spelling reforms spells trouble for the german nation because it shows that the ability to change is predicated upon the ability to give up old habits .
and it is in the department of old habits that germany is showing its greatest weakness . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spelling divide as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed .

but latvia , which has fought hard to keep its own language , says no amount of eu rhetoric will change it back from eiro .
-lrb- jan 5 , 2006 -rrb- german states back spelling reform while several german publishers recently rejected the country 's six-year-old spelling reform , a clear majority of states intend to stick to the change in schools , according to a news report .

germany has asked the us for more information about an alleged secret plan by saddam hussein to defend baghdad before the war after a us paper reported its spies had passed it on to american forces . this week the new york times reported that german intelligence agents had obtained a copy of the plan and passed it on to the us weeks before the invasion . the report , which germany has vehemently denied , has triggered huge controversy and calls for a parliamentary inquiry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newspaper report has caused an uproar in germany on friday , germany still stuck to its denial but a government spokesman said berlin had asked washington for more details about the affair .

2004 of manslaughter and given an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for slaughtering and consuming a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin at his home in the central german town of rotenburg and videotaping the act .
meiwes had met his victim on the internet after he advertised for someone willing to be eaten . a federal tribunal last april upheld an appeal lodged by state prosecutors , calling the verdict too lenient , and ordered a new trial which began in january .
prosecutors are seeking a life sentence . based on real-life events the hollywood thriller tells the tale of fictional american criminal psychology student katie -lrb- keri russell -rrb- who is drawn in by the bizarre case of a meiwes-like character called oliver hartwin . much like meiwes ' life , the cannibal plot of the movie shows a younger hartwin as a loner forced by an overbearing mother to wear lederhosen at school .
like meiwes , he dreams up an imaginary friend . later , as a computer repairman - meiwes 's own profession - the film-character is drawn to the " cannibal cantina " web site in his search for a willing victim . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal back on trial armin meiwes , the self-confessed german cannibal convicted of killing a man , began his retrial on murder charges thursday in frankfurt .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .
what are the cha n ces kli n sma n n 's team wi n s the title ? germany 's strength has always been playing a collective and compact game .
klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .

the brazilian star talks about his dw-world.de blog , in german and brazilian , and germany 's chances at the world cup . dw-world.de : your world cup blog o n dw-world.de -lrb- in german and brazilian -rrb- will start tomorrow .
what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .
i am thrilled with the chance to write a blog since they are really gaining in popularity .
i 'm really looking forward to telling soccer fans about the world cup and my life . what are you expecti n g from your time kicki n g it arou n d with dw-world.de 's readers ? i hope that people will take part with comments and questions so we can swap our soccer and life experience in a laid-back setting , that makes it very important that people chose to take part .
i 'll talk about my experiences as a player and maybe share a few peculiar anecdotes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer fans have good reason to be excited about the world cup the elber blog is goi n g to co n ce n trate mai n ly o n the world cup .
are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .
all the players on the roster could also play for the selecao .
there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .

klinsmann has put together good team and a couple of successes during friendly matches , but the world cup is something completely different .
defense , where the germans are traditionally strong , is this german team 's weak point .
from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .

what do you thi n k of the idea ? giova n e elber : i think it 's great .
the first thing i did when i returned home to brazil was setting up the television to receive deutsche welle so our family does n't lose contact with the german language .

are brazilia n s already excited about the world cup ? world cup fever is running almost as hot in brazil as it is in germany , where everyone is getting ready .
here people only talk about the copa , and most the stores have some kind of world cup products on the shelves .
everyone is hoping for the best world cup of all time . which teams do you thi n k are the favorites ? to me the favorites are always the same : doubtlessly the brazilians , then come argentina , england , germany , who are always strong at home , and portugal , who are good for a surprise under scolari .
there are also a couple of teams from africa that could make it into the round of 16 or quarter-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 brazilian side is even better than four years ago when they won the cup is today 's brazilia n selecao better tha n i n 2002 ? yes , they are stronger .

there are a lot of exceptional players like ronaldinho , ronaldo , kaká , robinho and adriano .
carlos alberto parreira can be pleased with the team he has to coach , but it 's up to him to find a way of not being surprised by teams with good tactical formations . could the excess of good players become a problem for parreira ? i do n't think so .
all the players know that the world cup is the biggest showcase of international soccer .
everyone knows his role in the selecao .
naturally someone like ronaldinho or ronaldo always wants to play , but when they 're not in good form they need to make way for others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team captian michael ballack , right , is one of the few german players doing well in league matches some of the ca n didates for the germa n world cup squad are stuck i n a slump .

from the midfield to the strikers there are players like ballack , klose , kuranyi , and podolski who can decide a game . will 2006 be " ballack 's " world cup ? ballack is having a good stretch , when the rumors about him leaving bayern munich are ignored .
but he 's a professional who can tune out those kinds of problems and concentrate on bayern and the national team .
he can be a big help to klinsmann 's younger players , like podolski . what could happe n if ballack is missi n g from a decidi n g world cup match ? then germany will suffer a lot , he plays a key role in the german team .
if he is n't 100 percent fit or misses a game here or there it will be very difficult for the germans .
the german tactical system and midfield rely on him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors have it that a number of teams would like to take ballack from his bayern teammates what advice would you give ballack : stay at bayer n or switch to a differe n t club ? i would tell him to stay .
after i left munich i learned that there are very few clubs that work as professionally as bayern .
it 's a top club .
but if ballack is planning to experience a different culture and gets an offer from real madrid or manchester united , it will be something for him to think about .
maybe it would even be good for german soccer if he played in a foreign country .
the german national team is missing players with foreign experience , like klinsmann , matthäus and hässler had . how would you grade kli n sma n n 's work , especially his n ot exactly u n co n troversial trai n i n g methods ? he is doing an excellent job and getting the most out of what the players have to offer .
he is trying to bring something new from his experience in italy and the usa , and that 's a shock for the german team - just like it 's a shock for brazilians that matthäus holds atlético paranaense practices on game days . but what klinsmann really needs to do is get the defense sorted out and cut out the goalkeeper rotation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.03.2006 eastern europe draws veil of silence over communist past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in hungary would rather not lift the lid on informer subterfuge with a number of high-profile hungarians recently named as former secret-police informers , calls for a look at the country 's past have been getting louder .
but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .
" not five years ago - 50 !
i was arrested with two school friends , and we were questioned for three days and nights .
eventually i was forced to sign a statement saying i would work with the secret police . " faci n g the demo n s the pervasive presence of informers and collaborators during the communist era is an issue that has never been addressed at a political level in hungary .
even so , it 's a skeleton in the closet of public consciousness that refuses to go away . andras gervai , a historian from budapest , insists that the country needs to face its demons . " it can become very problematic when a country fails to reflect on its past , " he said .
" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .
" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '
and post-1989 , he was the conscience of the nation . " but in fact , szabo met with broad understanding rather than outrage , while gervai received an avalanche of threat letters and indignation that he had gone public with the case .
it was obvious to him what the hungarian people would have preferred to happen : " if szabo had ever meant anything to me then i would have destroyed his file when i came across it in the archives and prevented it from ever reaching the public , " he said , describing the main response his findings have elicited . no soul-searchi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviet tanks in prague in 1968 unlike germany and the czech republic , which opened up police files in the early 1990s , hungary waited until 1997 to allow its citizens to apply for access to their files in the secret police archives . but the new law failed to usher in an era of soul-searching - not least because the archive is only required to release files it decides do not represent a threat to national security . the result is that only selective files get published , usually for reasons of political expedience , such as during election campaigns . to some , a complete opening of the archives would amount to laying the cards on the table and might prevent files being used as political tools .
but others feel it would be counter-productive . " there are so many people who can no longer defend themselves , " szabo said .
" these are people with a lifetime behind them , and they 're being slandered for political ends .
and they can not tell their side of the story . " political observers believe that not only former communists have a vested interest in keeping the files under lock and key - they believe that parliamentary parties across the board see the hungarian people 's reluctance to banish the ghosts of the last few decades as a natural turning away from the past . but given that some 150,000 hungarians are thought to have collaborated with the secret police , it seems likely that those ghosts will catch up with the public soon . harriett ferenci -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : hungary to open spy files making an about-turn , hungary 's ruling socialist party said on wednesday that it now backed fully opening communist-era secret service files , in an attempt to confront the country 's ghosts of the past .

2004 of manslaughter and given an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for slaughtering and consuming a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin at his home in the central german town of rotenburg and videotaping the act .
meiwes had met his victim on the internet after he advertised for someone willing to be eaten . a federal tribunal last april upheld an appeal lodged by state prosecutors , calling the verdict too lenient , and ordered a new trial which began in january .
prosecutors are seeking a life sentence . based on real-life events the hollywood thriller tells the tale of fictional american criminal psychology student katie -lrb- keri russell -rrb- who is drawn in by the bizarre case of a meiwes-like character called oliver hartwin . much like meiwes ' life , the cannibal plot of the movie shows a younger hartwin as a loner forced by an overbearing mother to wear lederhosen at school .
like meiwes , he dreams up an imaginary friend . later , as a computer repairman - meiwes 's own profession - the film-character is drawn to the " cannibal cantina " web site in his search for a willing victim . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german cannibal back on trial armin meiwes , the self-confessed german cannibal convicted of killing a man , began his retrial on murder charges thursday in frankfurt .

but resistance to national soul-searching is equally insistent . since the collapse of the iron curtain in 1989 , former dissidents and historians have been campaigning for access to archives in eastern europe - with little success .
when it comes to confronting communist crimes , the former east bloc has failed to achieve the depth of debate seen in germany , a country which has spent decades examining its nazi past . in hungary , a number of prominent figures were recently named as former secret service informants , including oscar-winning film director istvan szabo and the retired cardinal laszlo paskai , accused of cooperating with the secret police in the late 1950s . cases like these have shocked and divided the nation .
just a small percentage of the population sees the need for a broad confrontation with the country 's past , while a clear majority would prefer to make a clean break , opposing the introduction of a new legislation and complete access to the communist secret services archives . many feel that an investigation into post-war hungary will do nothing other than reopen old wounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istvan szabo " it was 50 years ago , " szabo said .
" not five years ago - 50 !
i was arrested with two school friends , and we were questioned for three days and nights .
eventually i was forced to sign a statement saying i would work with the secret police . " faci n g the demo n s the pervasive presence of informers and collaborators during the communist era is an issue that has never been addressed at a political level in hungary .
even so , it 's a skeleton in the closet of public consciousness that refuses to go away . andras gervai , a historian from budapest , insists that the country needs to face its demons . " it can become very problematic when a country fails to reflect on its past , " he said .
" it ca n't cover it up with partial truths - it 's shameful . " gervai was responsible for exposing the world-famous film director istvan szabo as a former informer for the hungarian state security services . " i was appalled myself to discover that istvan szabo , of all people , was a spy , " he said .
" he was always considered a beacon of integrity in hungary . he influenced a whole generation with films like ' mephisto . '
and post-1989 , he was the conscience of the nation . " but in fact , szabo met with broad understanding rather than outrage , while gervai received an avalanche of threat letters and indignation that he had gone public with the case .
it was obvious to him what the hungarian people would have preferred to happen : " if szabo had ever meant anything to me then i would have destroyed his file when i came across it in the archives and prevented it from ever reaching the public , " he said , describing the main response his findings have elicited . no soul-searchi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soviet tanks in prague in 1968 unlike germany and the czech republic , which opened up police files in the early 1990s , hungary waited until 1997 to allow its citizens to apply for access to their files in the secret police archives . but the new law failed to usher in an era of soul-searching - not least because the archive is only required to release files it decides do not represent a threat to national security . the result is that only selective files get published , usually for reasons of political expedience , such as during election campaigns . to some , a complete opening of the archives would amount to laying the cards on the table and might prevent files being used as political tools .
but others feel it would be counter-productive . " there are so many people who can no longer defend themselves , " szabo said .
" these are people with a lifetime behind them , and they 're being slandered for political ends .
and they can not tell their side of the story . " political observers believe that not only former communists have a vested interest in keeping the files under lock and key - they believe that parliamentary parties across the board see the hungarian people 's reluctance to banish the ghosts of the last few decades as a natural turning away from the past . but given that some 150,000 hungarians are thought to have collaborated with the secret police , it seems likely that those ghosts will catch up with the public soon . harriett ferenci -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : hungary to open spy files making an about-turn , hungary 's ruling socialist party said on wednesday that it now backed fully opening communist-era secret service files , in an attempt to confront the country 's ghosts of the past .

it has reached agreement with bp subsidiary britoil to increase its stake in the statfjord field , which will deliver more gas to the uk market .
centrica will pay $ 266m -lrb- £ 151m -rrb- to buy bp 's 4.84 % holding in the field .
centrica recently announced an 11 % rise in operating profit to £ 1.5bn for 2005 .
and british gas raised prices by 22 % recently , blaming high wholesale costs .
sir roy gardner , chief executive of centrica , said : " we have delivered significant value from our current interest in statfjord and now have the opportunity to increase our presence in one of the north sea 's largest fields which will deliver additional gas into the uk market .
" this is in keeping with our upstream strategy , to build our portfolio of high quality producing assets and medium term development opportunities to supply our british gas customers . "
new pipeline statfjord is an oil field that is on the border between the norwegian and british sectors of the continental shelf in the north sea , in around 145 metres of water .
the deal should add an additional 65 billion cubic feet -lrb- bcf -rrb- of gas and 14.5 million barrels of oil to centrica 's portfolio .
the company acquired its original 4.84 % interest in statfjord , one of the largest fields discovered in the north sea , from chevron texaco two years ago .
statfjord is currently an oil producing field with associated gas which will be re-engineered to focus on gas production .
centrica 's additional share of the associated capital expenditure for the project will be roughly £ 50m .
a new export pipeline from the statfjord field to the flags pipeline into st fergus will also enable additional quantities of gas to be delivered to the uk market .
statfjord is situated on the border of uk and norwegian waters .
centrica intends to increase its participation in the norwegian oil and gas sector , having pre-qualified as an operator in norway in 2005 .
in august , centrica said it was to buy stakes in four north sea oil and gas fields from kerr mcgee for £ 318.6m.

drivers across parts of north and mid wales have been warned to expect icy roads as thawing snow freezes .
the met office has warned motorists to be wary in anglesey , conwy , wrexham , gwynedd , denbighshire , flintshire , powys and ceredigion .
the heavy snowfall and plunging temperatures have previously seen more than 400 schools close their doors for each of the past two days .

coleg menai campuses are closed to students but open to staff .

ceredigion council said no schools closed and on the roads , gritters were out , particularly in the north of the county .
eisteddfod ceredigion council has said any refuse not collected within the next few days due to the weather will be collected next week at the usual collection times .

north wales police reported no road closures but there was ice on some roads on friday morning .
motorists were advised to take care , particularly on minor roads .
all council run sports pitches in wrexham will be closed this weekend because of the weather .
another casualty of the weather is bala 's eisteddfod , which was due to take place at capel annibynwyr on friday evening .

meet the panel name : debra tysall lives : british but live in los angeles occupation : several jobs , used to be a chef favourite all-time film : shawshank redemption with la confidential also up there click here to return to the oscar panel my favourite movie of the last year , the constant gardener , did not get a best picture nomination , which leads me to believe many voters did n't actually see the movie .
however , i am really hoping that at least rachel weisz gets to win for best supporting actress , although why she did n't get nominated for best actress is a mystery to me .
i think crash will pick up the best screenplay award , and possibly matt dillon might just get it for best supporting actor , although i have a sneaking suspicion it 's going to be paul giamatti , who really was great in cinderella man .
although i really enjoyed brokeback mountain , i am not as enamoured of it as some , but i think it will get either best picture or best director , the latter i think would be more deserving .
read debra 's previous posts oscar memories oscar nominations reaction oscar nomination hopes what can i say about wallace and gromit , they are a national treasure as far as i am concerned , and nick park should be knighted immediately for his services to animation !
is there enough room on his mantel for another statuette , i wonder ! "

read megan 's previous posts oscar memories oscar nominations reaction oscar nomination hopes and anything but the march of the penguins for best documentary feature -lrb- because of my work , i 've seen this one about eight times .
i 'm tired of those penguins ! -rrb-

meet the panel name : todd beasley age : 40 lives : augusta , georgia occupation : art director for media company favourite all-time film : the trip to bountiful -lrb- 1985 -rrb- click here to return to the oscar panel main page brokeback mountain is still the odds-on favourite to win best picture , although i will say to my surprise that crash has become a much stronger contender than i would have anticipated - especially since i would never have nominated it to begin with .
and , reese witherspoon seems to have the best actress category clinched , another one i would not have nominated -lrb- though most academy members obviously do n't agree with me -rrb- .
reportedly , she is now asking a mere $ 30m per film , so she must be doing something right .
enough said .
now that i have seen all of the nominated films , only one of my earlier opinions has been altered .
read todd 's previous posts oscar memories oscar nominations reaction oscar nomination hopes i now feel that munich is definitely deserving of not only a best picture nomination , but also the oscar itself .
i would not be disappointed if it won over brokeback mountain , though i would definitely be surprised .
but are n't surprises what award shows are really all about ?
nonetheless , come oscar night , i will still be rooting for brokeback mountain .
it is still , to me , a groundbreaking movie and to borrow the title of david eggers ' recent novel , " a heartbreaking work of staggering genius " .

lord knows on oscar night the nominees probably have n't slept for days let alone eaten anything .
i could vacuum the red carpet and make them chicken soup for sustenance .
i wonder how the nominees manage to keep that gracious , fixed smile as the other guy wins ?
they always applaud eagerly for the winner and give a knowing nod as though they expected to be trumped by their competitor .
they surely must rehearse that moment : " i am not disappointed i am delighted .
i am not disappointed i am delighted . "
a pre-oscars mantra .
it 's only very occasionally that we see the fixed smile fall into a grimace .
i wish it happened more often .
it 's far too posh to be so well behaved and nice .

lord knows on oscar night the nominees probably have n't slept for days let alone eaten anything .
i could vacuum the red carpet and make them chicken soup for sustenance .
i wonder how the nominees manage to keep that gracious , fixed smile as the other guy wins ?
they always applaud eagerly for the winner and give a knowing nod as though they expected to be trumped by their competitor .
they surely must rehearse that moment : " i am not disappointed i am delighted .
i am not disappointed i am delighted . "
a pre-oscars mantra .
it 's only very occasionally that we see the fixed smile fall into a grimace .
i wish it happened more often .
it 's far too posh to be so well behaved and nice .
modesty must be so difficult to carry off in that split second .
