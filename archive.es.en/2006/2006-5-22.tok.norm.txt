and topics like human rights and iran 's status as a nuclear power were also on the agenda . most of all , though , the visit was about two governments getting to know each other .
it was the chancellor 's first visit to china since taking office a half a year ago . the 63 year old wen clearly took to merkel , saying she brought a " friendly wind " to beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles soon made way for hard talking for her part , merkel said germany 's relationship with china was good , but there was room for improvement . after the discussions in beijing , merkel and wen announced that germany and china had agreed that iran should not be allowed to build nuclear weapons .
however , despite the rather obvious and expected consensus , there was no mention of any progress in decreasing the divisions over what action should be taken to enforce it . agreeme n t o n weapo n s but n o co n se n sus o n actio n " we talked about iran and both -lrb- of us -rrb- agreed iran should not have the capability to make nuclear weapons and should n't proliferate weapons of mass destruction , " merkel told a joint press conference with wen . chancellor merkel also chose to bring up the topic of china 's human rights record , an issue that critics in germany have pushed merkel to address and one that her predecessor gerhard schröder was loath to do on his visits to the people 's republic . " it 's an important issue of bilateral dialogue , " merkel told the assembled press after talks at the great hall of the people .
she did not go into details on whether she brought up any specific human rights cases but added : " i have made it clear that human rights are indivisible . " merkel is critical of efforts within the european union to lift the ban on arms sales to beijing without first securing guarantees on human rights reforms in china . pirated goods a n d price dumpi n g co n cer n s addressed trade between germany and china was also on the agenda .
bilateral trade reached 49.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.2 billion -rrb- last year , making germany china 's largest trading partner in the european union .

" because we are technological leaders in many areas , protection of intellectual property is crucial to our success , " merkel told the fourth meeting of the high-technology dialogue forum , attended by over 300 german and chinese business and industry representatives .
" but i observe with great interest the rise in china 's technological capacities , " she said .
" that should give china a higher stake in effectively protecting intellectual property . " premier wen jiabao conceded there are still " many problems " in the area .
" the protection of intellectual property is not only an international duty for us , but it also serves the interests of china , " mr wen said , adding that his government was considering both " administrative " and " judicial " tools to better protect companies ' proprietary information . german industrialists , who have often complained about the lax enforcement of china 's anti-piracy laws , say chinese regulations actually encourage intellectual property theft by forcing german companies to reveal highly detailed proprietary information about their technologies , for instance when bidding for public tenders . an agreement between german and chinese textile industry representatives against product piracy that would punish companies that make counterfeit textiles is expected to be signed during merkel 's visit . the german contingent were also expected to discuss the the eu 's anti-dumping tariffs on clothing and footwear with their chinese counterparts , a contentious issue which has been threatening to spill over into a full-scale trade war . leaders sig n railway deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technology will be applied to a new generation of trains the two nations did agree on a deal which would see germany 's siemens , china 's ministry of railways and chinese firm csr zhuzhou electric locomotive work together on the building of 500 chinese trains , although no details about the timing or extent of cooperation were given in the agreement or by chinese officials . siemens president and chief executive officer klaus kleinfeld told reporters after the memorandum of understanding was signed that the total value of the project could be worth 1.2 billion euros . in shanghai on tuesday , merkel planned to look at germany 's favorite export object , the transrapid rail line . dw staff -lrb- nda / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a flawed sino-german business connection product piracy is high on the agenda of german chancellor angela merkel 's current trip to china .

a key part of it was an escape clause that allowed the referendum on independence after three years . it was also the eu 's top diplomat who was behind the conditions laid down for the vote ; that of a 55 percent benchmark for it being accepted and on the provision that more than 50 percent of people take part . fair electio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegrins have already taken to flying their flag " the commission is pleased to note the preliminary report that the referendum in montenegro was carried out in a calm manner and with a high turnout , which is important for the legitimacy of the vote , " a spokesman added . officials for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- also hailed the conduct of montenegro 's referendum as in line with democratic standards .

eu officials also said that it was willing to enter into negotiations for a stabilization and association agreement - a crucial step towards eu membership - with montenegro .
they said that the new country faced a " great challenge " to modernize its administration in order to enable it to engage in negotiations with brussels . negotiations with serbia-montenegro were recently halted because of serbia 's failure to comply with demands by the international war crimes tribunal to hand over war crimes suspect ratko mladic , the leader of the bosnian serb army during the war . timeli n e for i n depe n de n ce montenegrin prime minister milo djukanovic already proclaimed victory for the pro-independence camp early monday before the official result was announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milo djukanovic " ladies and gentlemen , let me tell you that tonight , by the decision of the people of montenegro , an independent montenegro has been renewed , " a jubilant djukanovic told his supporters .
" this is the most important day in the history of montenegro , " said the long-time advocate of independence , who added that his motive for creating a separate state was a desire not to be dominated by serbia , which has a population more than 10 times the size of montenegro 's 650,000 . the montenegrin parliament will now have to declare independence within 15 days of receiving the official results of sunday 's referendum .
the serbian parliament will also have to proclaim the republic 's own independence .
after the independence declarations , the union between the two republics automatically ceases to exist . the breakup of the federation is unlikely to affect the two independent economic systems of serbia and montenegro , as they have already been operating separately for three years .
montenegro adopted the german mark and then the euro as its official currency years ago , while serbia still uses the dinar . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenges of integrating southeast europe both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .

about three weeks ago , the german foreign ministry announced the release of german engineers rene braunlich and thomas nitzschke , who had been kidnapped in january . that was about six months after the release of another german hostage , susanne ostloff , who was held for three weeks . both times , german government officials denied payments to kidnappers amid wide-spread speculation and even confirmation by the hostages themselves .
they also gave no details on the releases .
" our principle is that the government rejects ransom payments , " reinhard silberberg , the head of the german foreign ministry 's team responsible for such matters told the leipziger volkszeitung .
" the government does n't let itself be blackmailed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reportedly $ 5 million was paid for the release of thomas nitzschke and rene braeunlich france and italy , both of whom had hostages freed in the past year , have made similar statements . but now , documents unearthed by the london times show the three countries approved of payments worth $ 45 million -lrb- 34 million euros -rrb- to free nine hostages in iraq . anger over payments the paper reported that the documents , held by security officials in baghdad involved in hostage negotiations , show the governments involved paid between $ 2.5 million and $ 10 million per hostage in the past two years . that includes an alleged $ 3 million for ostloff , $ 5 million for braunlich and nitzschke from germany ; $ 10 million for journalist florence aubenas and $ 15 million for journalists christian chesnot and georges malbrunot from france , released in june 2005 and december 2004 respectively ; and $ 6 million for guiliana segrena and $ 5 million for aid volunteers simona pari and simona torretta from italy , who were freed in march 2005 and september 2004 respectively . the documents also show , according to the newspaper , that the al-qaeda-affiliated gang responsible for kidnapping and murdering british engineer kenneth bigley in 2004 also received money . since the war began in 2003 , more than 250 foreigners have been kidnapped in iraq .
to date , about 44 have been killed , and 135 released .
six were rescued , three escaped , and nothing more is known about the others . vehement denials french officials have denied paying for the release of their citizens , according to the associated press . " as french authorities indicated at the moment of the release of the hostages , there has been no payment of ransom , " foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei said . german and italian officials have not commented on the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foriegn minister frank-walter steinmeier has come close to admitting payments for hostages other countries such as sweden , romania and turkey have allegedly paid for hostages , as have us companies doing reconstruction work in iraq .
and about 30 iraqis are kidnapped a day , according to police .
most are returned after families pay ransoms . encouraging kidnappers many are criticizing the practice of giving in to kidnappers ' demands saying it encourages them . " in theory we stand together in not rewarding kidnappers but in practice it seems some administrations have parted with cash and so it puts other foreign nationals at risk from gangs who are confident that some governments do pay , " one senior diplomat in iraq told the newspaper . british officials criticized the practice openly but the newspaper noted that irish aid worker margaret hassan , who had lived in iraq for 30 years , was murdered in november 2004 after prime minister tony blair said on a arab satellite channel that the government would not pay any ransom . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german officials irate about proposed industry ransom fund on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs .
-lrb- may 6 , 2006 -rrb- public frustration mounts in case of german hostages the continued captivity of german engineers taken hostage in iraq over two months ago is leading to a sense among some germans that the government is not doing enough to secure their release .
-lrb- april 14 , 2006 -rrb- germany relieved by freeing of hostage , but questions remain germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .

the czech republic has received " no concrete proposal " from the us for locating an anti ´ -missile defense base on czech soil .
according to reports , us officials plan the base as protection against an iranian attack . " the location of this us anti-rocket base on the territory of some european state is just an idea , there is no concrete proposal , " andrej cirtek , a spokesman for the czech ministry of defense , told afp on monday . cirtek was responding to an article in monday 's edition of the new york times that said us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was expected to make a recommendation this summer on the site for the europe-based defense system .
the czech republic and poland are both under consideration , the paper reported . should the system be based in poland , it would be the first permanent us military installation in the former communist country .
russian officials reportedly oppose this , fearing that washington could extend its influence over eastern europe . adjusti n g to n ew threat from ira n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us missile defense agency seal the new york times said the us administration 's proposal calls for installing 10 missile interceptors at a european site by 2011 .
the final cost , including the interceptors themselves , is estimated at $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.25 billion euros -rrb- .
us department of defense officials have reportedly already asked congress to approve $ 56 million in initial funding for the project . the washi n gto n times and i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e reported in march that a deal on the anti-missile site was close to being signed . the latest new york times article , citing unnamed pentagon officials , said the missiles based at the site would protect the us and its european allies from iranian attack .
so far , anti-missile systems exist in alaska and california and are meant to protect the us against an attack from north korea . lo n g-term project cirtek said the anti-missile site has been the subject of discussions between experts from us and their european counterparts at nato for several years .

us tv companies are hoping that millions more will in the country where football is played with the hands and the biggest world championship is a baseball event , world cup fever is gradually taking hold - at least that 's what us broadcasters are hoping . television and radio networks across the us are expecting such a demand for the soccer showcase that all 64 games of the 2006 world cup in germany will be broadcast live across the country , where soccer is gaining currency as a viewing spectacle amid a large hispanic following . while the world 's most popular sport remains a minority interest in the us market compared with commercial juggernauts like american football , buying up world cup television rights in the states is becoming an increasingly expensive proposition . for the national abc network and espn sports network - both owned by the walt disney company - the coming tournament in germany will mark their fourth straight shared broadcast of a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans in the us will be spolied for choice for the first time , the games will be televised in high definition and abc will broadcast 12 matches live - a significant change from the 2002 tournament in japan and south korea when the network only showed the final live .
espn will carry 21 matches live , with the remaining 31 games to be shown on espn2 . investment in the future in november , abc and espn announced that they had also secured the us english-language rights for the 2010 and 2014 tournaments as part of a $ 100 million -lrb- 128 million euro -rrb- package - more than twice the price paid for the 2002 and 2006 tournaments . the cost of the us spanish-language rights have shown a similar inflationary trend , with univision forking out over $ 325 million for the next two tournaments , an increase of $ 200 million on the sum it stumped up for the 2002 and 2006 world cups . of the gross us audience of 85 million that watched the 2002 tournament , around 80 million were hispanic .
the overall figure would probably have been higher but for the time difference with asia that meant most matches were played in the middle of the night . foreign language broadcasters find their niche bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koreans like their soccer another notable broadcaster in the us market this time around will be kbs world , a korean-language subscription channel available via satellite or digital cable in some areas . although its audience is tiny compared to the number of hispanic viewers , kbs will show 56 games live and 8 games via short tape delay . for those soccer fans on the move or otherwise away from their television sets , this year 's world cup will , for the first time , be available on satellite radio . xm , the largest us satellite radio service with more than six million subscribers , launched a dedicated world cup soccer channel last month .
the channel will provide english and spanish-language commentary of most games in the competition . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de playing the name game when is football not football ?

" i have to admit that after two and a half years of negotiations , we are not as far along as we would like to be , " steinmeier said when asked about european efforts to convince iran to halt uranium enrichment .
" the situation requires not only creativity on our part , but also more flexibility on the iranian side , " he said at a joint press conference with his kuwaiti counterpart sheikh mohammed al-sabah al-salem . " the kuwaitis ' concerns - and not only the kuwaitis , but of all the gulf states - are obvious , " salem said , reflecting the gulf monarchs ' bid to remain neutral while preferring to avoid any military confrontation in the region .

we have a state in iran that meddles in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- peace process , " she said . rice also denied that the eu3 of britain , france and germany had asked washington to provide guarantees that no threat would be made to the iranian government . " first of all , let me just set the record straight .
we have n't been asked to provide security assurances to iran , " she said . " what we 're talking about is a package that will make clear to iran that there are choices to be made , either that there will be sanctions and actions taken against iran by the international community , or there 's a way for them to meet their civil nuclear concerns . " iran remains stubborn iran vowed again on sunday it would not suspend uranium enrichment . iran says it wants to enrich only to make reactor fuel but the us in particular accuses iran of using an atomic energy drive as a cover for acquiring an atomic bomb . steinmeier arrived in kuwait late saturday on the first leg of a six-country gulf tour that comes amid a growing international crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions . he was to arrive in oman later sunday .

the film , starring spanish actress penelope cruz , is a look at three generations of women in spain . but the spanish film faces stiff competition from the anglo-saxon world . british director ken loach 's new film , " the wind that shakes the barley , " is expected to do well .
and british newcomer andrea arnold and her film " red road " is anticipated as a surprise hit . " america is really performing badly this year , " mark cousins , a film expert and author told reuters .
" asia is doing next to nothing in the competition , so it is really europe that is shining with an old-fashioned approach to cinema . " hollywood disappoints some expected hollywood blockbusters left audiences unimpressed . " the da vinci code " opened the festival and was panned as boring and convoluted even as its success in the theaters in its first few days is proof of the public 's anticipation of the movie .

" the film is " the true story of two new york port authority policemen who are trapped in the rubble , their wives and their children and the incredible and almost improbable rescue efforts to save them , " stone told the cannes audience sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : movies about the sept .
11 terrorist attacks are being well-received but the film , which goes on release in august just ahead of the fifth anniversary of the attacks in which nearly 3,000 people died , remains so sensitive that paramount pictures has written to theaters warning them that the trailers are now being screened . as the clip ended in cannes with a shot of nicolas cage 's eyes blinking open in the dark , there was a sharp intake of breath and then applause for stone . paul greengrass ' " united 93 " is also to be shown here , telling the story of a fourth plane bound for washington , which crashed into a field in pennsylvania after a passenger uprising . in march , one new york cinema stopped showing a preview for the film because of the audience 's negative response to it .

another example of product piracy product piracy is high on the agenda of german chancellor angela merkel 's current trip to china .
german businesses lose billions as a result , and offers to cooperate with counterfeiters do n't seem to help . if a hong kong department store had not caught fire in 1994 , j.h. hochköppler would have never thought about investing in china .
the fire had been caused by a faulty electric connector that bore the name of hochköppler 's company , adels-contact . as a result , the connector was sent back to germany to find out what happened . " we did n't think about the possibility that the connector was n't actually produced by us , " hochköppler said , adding that product piracy was n't a big issue back then . losi n g billio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks familiar ?
but technical tests showed the connector had in fact been counterfeited .
and while it perfectly matched the original in terms of appearance , it was seriously flawed in terms of technology . hochköppler had joined the ranks of a growing number of german businesses that suffer as a result of product piracy . according to estimates , german manufacturers lose about 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 38.4 billion -rrb- because of counterfeiting each year .
roughly 70 percent of these fake products are made in china . while no longer threatened by reparation claims as a result , hochköppler began searching for chinese product pirates who were copying his connectors .
he found the culprits and proposed cooperation . futile n egotiatio n s " maybe we could meet to talk about producing functioning connectors , " he told them , hoping this would prevent further problems in the future .
hochköppler spent a year negotiating a joint venture : he proposed adels-contact hold 51 percent of the hong-kong-based company , with the counterfeiter holding 49 percent . " in the end - the contract was almost ready - we found out that he 'd kept copying our products , " hochköppler said , adding that he stopped negotiations immediately . he 's not thought about venturing into china again .
" i can understand the euphoric feelings about china , " hochköppler said .
he said he also might reconsider a second attempt to come to the chinese market in the future - " maybe , if we have more legal security . " " wages are n ' t everythi n g " until then , adels-contact will continue to produce connectors in eastern europe and ship them to china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wages may be lower in china , but raw materials often cost more " that 's not much more expensive than producing in china , " he said , adding that raw materials such as brass and bronze cost more in china than in europe .
" wages are n't everything . " in the meantime , hochköppler 's counterfeiter continues to produce his connectors and even tried to offer them at a trade fair in germany .
hochköppler threatened to sue and the chinese retracted . watchi n g the copy-cats since then , adels-contact officials carefully observe what 's happening in china .
they have n't spotted any other copy attempts since . " people know we 're watching them , " he said , adding that the counterfeiter has since started producing his own connectors . " but they 're not good enough for the international market , " hochköppler said .

and topics like human rights and iran 's status as a nuclear power were also on the agenda . most of all , though , the visit was about two governments getting to know each other .
it was the chancellor 's first visit to china since taking office a half a year ago . the 63 year old wen clearly took to merkel , saying she brought a " friendly wind " to beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles soon made way for hard talking for her part , merkel said germany 's relationship with china was good , but there was room for improvement . after the discussions in beijing , merkel and wen announced that germany and china had agreed that iran should not be allowed to build nuclear weapons .
however , despite the rather obvious and expected consensus , there was no mention of any progress in decreasing the divisions over what action should be taken to enforce it . agreeme n t o n weapo n s but n o co n se n sus o n actio n " we talked about iran and both -lrb- of us -rrb- agreed iran should not have the capability to make nuclear weapons and should n't proliferate weapons of mass destruction , " merkel told a joint press conference with wen . chancellor merkel also chose to bring up the topic of china 's human rights record , an issue that critics in germany have pushed merkel to address and one that her predecessor gerhard schröder was loath to do on his visits to the people 's republic . " it 's an important issue of bilateral dialogue , " merkel told the assembled press after talks at the great hall of the people .
she did not go into details on whether she brought up any specific human rights cases but added : " i have made it clear that human rights are indivisible . " merkel is critical of efforts within the european union to lift the ban on arms sales to beijing without first securing guarantees on human rights reforms in china . pirated goods a n d price dumpi n g co n cer n s addressed trade between germany and china was also on the agenda .
bilateral trade reached 49.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.2 billion -rrb- last year , making germany china 's largest trading partner in the european union .
but even so there were still a few hot topics the chancellor chose to bring up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate goods from china cost the global economy billions fake goods and the protection of intellectual property rights is a chronic irritant in trade relations between the two countries and merkel , who was accompanied by a 40-strong delegation of german business leaders and economics minister michael glos , urged the chinese to take stronger measures to curtail a counterfeit industry which cost global business around 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- a year . " because we are technological leaders in many areas , protection of intellectual property is crucial to our success , " merkel told the fourth meeting of the high-technology dialogue forum , attended by over 300 german and chinese business and industry representatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.05.2006 moonlighting mp rekindles calls for " transparent legislators " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most agree that voters deserve clarity about side jobs of legislators a german lawmaker has been criticized for planning to moonlight as manager of a business lobbying group .
while most feel he should leave parliament , side jobs for parliamentarians in general remain a hot-button issue . norbert röttgen has little time to spare .
during a typical week , the member of germany 's parliament spends about 60 hours representing his constituents - and that 's not counting weekends , when he 's back in his district attending events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert röttgen has so far served as his party 's parliamentary manager but despite his full workload , the 40-year-old christian democrat , who is often described as a " close confidante " of chancellor angela merkel , now plans to take on another job : next january , he 's expected to become general manager of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , which represents the interests of german businesses . as a result , röttgen said he wo n't seek re-election to parliament in 2009 .
but citing a responsibility to the people who elected him , the lawmaker intends to keep his mandate until then . a co n flict of i n terest a n d too much work while many german parliamentarians - unlike us lawmakers , for example - keep working part-time in their professions while in office , a second full-time job remains the exception .
that 's why röttgen 's move has provoked criticism from across the political spectrum and even a former bdi president . " i would have never tolerated this , " said hans-olaf henkel , who headed the organization between 1995 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seats in germany 's parliament often remain empty as legislators have other obligations röttgen would certainly be an asset for bdi , henkel said .
but his simultaneous role as legislator and lobbyist represents a conflict of interest , he added , citing another parliamentarian who moonlights as general manager of the confederation of german employers ' associations as a bad precedent .
henkel also said that the bdi job was simply too demanding . " you ca n't just run off to parliamentary hearings , " he said , adding that he 's generally in favor of encouraging parliamentarians to work on the side in order to keep them grounded in society . a n eed for tra n spare n cy that 's a view shared by many , including members of the german chapter of corruption watchdog transparency international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's not quite as colorful and diverse as the lamps in its cafeteria " we need the know-how of people who have a professional career , " said jochen bäumel , a board member of the organization , adding that the additional income and business interests of lawmakers should be made public to create more transparency for voters . parliamentarians actually approved a new code of conduct last year .
it requires publication of the source and level of extra income .
all legislators had to hand over that information to parliamentary president norbert lammert by the end of march .

and topics like human rights and iran 's status as a nuclear power were also on the agenda . most of all , though , the visit was about two governments getting to know each other .
it was the chancellor 's first visit to china since taking office a half a year ago . the 63 year old wen clearly took to merkel , saying she brought a " friendly wind " to beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles soon made way for hard talking for her part , merkel said germany 's relationship with china was good , but there was room for improvement . after the discussions in beijing , merkel and wen announced that germany and china had agreed that iran should not be allowed to build nuclear weapons .
however , despite the rather obvious and expected consensus , there was no mention of any progress in decreasing the divisions over what action should be taken to enforce it . agreeme n t o n weapo n s but n o co n se n sus o n actio n " we talked about iran and both -lrb- of us -rrb- agreed iran should not have the capability to make nuclear weapons and should n't proliferate weapons of mass destruction , " merkel told a joint press conference with wen . chancellor merkel also chose to bring up the topic of china 's human rights record , an issue that critics in germany have pushed merkel to address and one that her predecessor gerhard schröder was loath to do on his visits to the people 's republic . " it 's an important issue of bilateral dialogue , " merkel told the assembled press after talks at the great hall of the people .
she did not go into details on whether she brought up any specific human rights cases but added : " i have made it clear that human rights are indivisible . " merkel is critical of efforts within the european union to lift the ban on arms sales to beijing without first securing guarantees on human rights reforms in china . pirated goods a n d price dumpi n g co n cer n s addressed trade between germany and china was also on the agenda .
bilateral trade reached 49.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.2 billion -rrb- last year , making germany china 's largest trading partner in the european union .

" because we are technological leaders in many areas , protection of intellectual property is crucial to our success , " merkel told the fourth meeting of the high-technology dialogue forum , attended by over 300 german and chinese business and industry representatives .
" but i observe with great interest the rise in china 's technological capacities , " she said .
" that should give china a higher stake in effectively protecting intellectual property . " premier wen jiabao conceded there are still " many problems " in the area .
" the protection of intellectual property is not only an international duty for us , but it also serves the interests of china , " mr wen said , adding that his government was considering both " administrative " and " judicial " tools to better protect companies ' proprietary information . german industrialists , who have often complained about the lax enforcement of china 's anti-piracy laws , say chinese regulations actually encourage intellectual property theft by forcing german companies to reveal highly detailed proprietary information about their technologies , for instance when bidding for public tenders . an agreement between german and chinese textile industry representatives against product piracy that would punish companies that make counterfeit textiles is expected to be signed during merkel 's visit . the german contingent were also expected to discuss the the eu 's anti-dumping tariffs on clothing and footwear with their chinese counterparts , a contentious issue which has been threatening to spill over into a full-scale trade war . leaders sig n railway deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technology will be applied to a new generation of trains the two nations did agree on a deal which would see germany 's siemens , china 's ministry of railways and chinese firm csr zhuzhou electric locomotive work together on the building of 500 chinese trains , although no details about the timing or extent of cooperation were given in the agreement or by chinese officials . siemens president and chief executive officer klaus kleinfeld told reporters after the memorandum of understanding was signed that the total value of the project could be worth 1.2 billion euros . in shanghai on tuesday , merkel planned to look at germany 's favorite export object , the transrapid rail line . dw staff -lrb- nda / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a flawed sino-german business connection product piracy is high on the agenda of german chancellor angela merkel 's current trip to china .

" as for a concrete project , there is nothing to negotiate , " he added . bildunterschrift : czech leaders in prague would have to approve the project establishment of a foreign base on czech soil would require approval from more than half of the total number of elected representatives in both houses of the czech parliament , the lower house and the senate , cirtek added . the czech republic is currently in the throes of a general election with polling on june 2 and 3 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans may aid us firms with ' star wars ' american defense contractors lockheed martin and northrop grumman say they will cooperate closely with european companies on the development of george w. bush 's so-called " star wars " missile defense system .

us tv companies are hoping that millions more will in the country where football is played with the hands and the biggest world championship is a baseball event , world cup fever is gradually taking hold - at least that 's what us broadcasters are hoping . television and radio networks across the us are expecting such a demand for the soccer showcase that all 64 games of the 2006 world cup in germany will be broadcast live across the country , where soccer is gaining currency as a viewing spectacle amid a large hispanic following . while the world 's most popular sport remains a minority interest in the us market compared with commercial juggernauts like american football , buying up world cup television rights in the states is becoming an increasingly expensive proposition . for the national abc network and espn sports network - both owned by the walt disney company - the coming tournament in germany will mark their fourth straight shared broadcast of a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans in the us will be spolied for choice for the first time , the games will be televised in high definition and abc will broadcast 12 matches live - a significant change from the 2002 tournament in japan and south korea when the network only showed the final live .
espn will carry 21 matches live , with the remaining 31 games to be shown on espn2 . investment in the future in november , abc and espn announced that they had also secured the us english-language rights for the 2010 and 2014 tournaments as part of a $ 100 million -lrb- 128 million euro -rrb- package - more than twice the price paid for the 2002 and 2006 tournaments . the cost of the us spanish-language rights have shown a similar inflationary trend , with univision forking out over $ 325 million for the next two tournaments , an increase of $ 200 million on the sum it stumped up for the 2002 and 2006 world cups . of the gross us audience of 85 million that watched the 2002 tournament , around 80 million were hispanic .
the overall figure would probably have been higher but for the time difference with asia that meant most matches were played in the middle of the night . foreign language broadcasters find their niche bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koreans like their soccer another notable broadcaster in the us market this time around will be kbs world , a korean-language subscription channel available via satellite or digital cable in some areas . although its audience is tiny compared to the number of hispanic viewers , kbs will show 56 games live and 8 games via short tape delay . for those soccer fans on the move or otherwise away from their television sets , this year 's world cup will , for the first time , be available on satellite radio . xm , the largest us satellite radio service with more than six million subscribers , launched a dedicated world cup soccer channel last month .
the channel will provide english and spanish-language commentary of most games in the competition . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de playing the name game when is football not football ?

" i have to admit that after two and a half years of negotiations , we are not as far along as we would like to be , " steinmeier said when asked about european efforts to convince iran to halt uranium enrichment .
" the situation requires not only creativity on our part , but also more flexibility on the iranian side , " he said at a joint press conference with his kuwaiti counterpart sheikh mohammed al-sabah al-salem . " the kuwaitis ' concerns - and not only the kuwaitis , but of all the gulf states - are obvious , " salem said , reflecting the gulf monarchs ' bid to remain neutral while preferring to avoid any military confrontation in the region .

we have a state in iran that meddles in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- peace process , " she said . rice also denied that the eu3 of britain , france and germany had asked washington to provide guarantees that no threat would be made to the iranian government . " first of all , let me just set the record straight .
we have n't been asked to provide security assurances to iran , " she said . " what we 're talking about is a package that will make clear to iran that there are choices to be made , either that there will be sanctions and actions taken against iran by the international community , or there 's a way for them to meet their civil nuclear concerns . " iran remains stubborn iran vowed again on sunday it would not suspend uranium enrichment . iran says it wants to enrich only to make reactor fuel but the us in particular accuses iran of using an atomic energy drive as a cover for acquiring an atomic bomb . steinmeier arrived in kuwait late saturday on the first leg of a six-country gulf tour that comes amid a growing international crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions . he was to arrive in oman later sunday .

11 terrorist attacks are being well-received but the film , which goes on release in august just ahead of the fifth anniversary of the attacks in which nearly 3,000 people died , remains so sensitive that paramount pictures has written to theaters warning them that the trailers are now being screened . as the clip ended in cannes with a shot of nicolas cage 's eyes blinking open in the dark , there was a sharp intake of breath and then applause for stone . paul greengrass ' " united 93 " is also to be shown here , telling the story of a fourth plane bound for washington , which crashed into a field in pennsylvania after a passenger uprising . in march , one new york cinema stopped showing a preview for the film because of the audience 's negative response to it .

11 terrorist attacks are being well-received but the film , which goes on release in august just ahead of the fifth anniversary of the attacks in which nearly 3,000 people died , remains so sensitive that paramount pictures has written to theaters warning them that the trailers are now being screened . as the clip ended in cannes with a shot of nicolas cage 's eyes blinking open in the dark , there was a sharp intake of breath and then applause for stone . paul greengrass ' " united 93 " is also to be shown here , telling the story of a fourth plane bound for washington , which crashed into a field in pennsylvania after a passenger uprising . in march , one new york cinema stopped showing a preview for the film because of the audience 's negative response to it .

a key part of it was an escape clause that allowed the referendum on independence after three years . it was also the eu 's top diplomat who was behind the conditions laid down for the vote ; that of a 55 percent benchmark for it being accepted and on the provision that more than 50 percent of people take part . fair electio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegrins have already taken to flying their flag " the commission is pleased to note the preliminary report that the referendum in montenegro was carried out in a calm manner and with a high turnout , which is important for the legitimacy of the vote , " a spokesman added . officials for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- also hailed the conduct of montenegro 's referendum as in line with democratic standards .

they said that the new country faced a " great challenge " to modernize its administration in order to enable it to engage in negotiations with brussels . negotiations with serbia-montenegro were recently halted because of serbia 's failure to comply with demands by the international war crimes tribunal to hand over war crimes suspect ratko mladic , the leader of the bosnian serb army during the war . timeli n e for i n depe n de n ce montenegrin prime minister milo djukanovic already proclaimed victory for the pro-independence camp early monday before the official result was announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milo djukanovic " ladies and gentlemen , let me tell you that tonight , by the decision of the people of montenegro , an independent montenegro has been renewed , " a jubilant djukanovic told his supporters .

the serbian parliament will also have to proclaim the republic 's own independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.05.2006 moonlighting mp rekindles calls for " transparent legislators " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most agree that voters deserve clarity about side jobs of legislators a german lawmaker has been criticized for planning to moonlight as manager of a business lobbying group .
while most feel he should leave parliament , side jobs for parliamentarians in general remain a hot-button issue . norbert röttgen has little time to spare .
during a typical week , the member of germany 's parliament spends about 60 hours representing his constituents - and that 's not counting weekends , when he 's back in his district attending events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert röttgen has so far served as his party 's parliamentary manager but despite his full workload , the 40-year-old christian democrat , who is often described as a " close confidante " of chancellor angela merkel , now plans to take on another job : next january , he 's expected to become general manager of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , which represents the interests of german businesses . as a result , röttgen said he wo n't seek re-election to parliament in 2009 .
but citing a responsibility to the people who elected him , the lawmaker intends to keep his mandate until then . a co n flict of i n terest a n d too much work while many german parliamentarians - unlike us lawmakers , for example - keep working part-time in their professions while in office , a second full-time job remains the exception .
that 's why röttgen 's move has provoked criticism from across the political spectrum and even a former bdi president . " i would have never tolerated this , " said hans-olaf henkel , who headed the organization between 1995 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seats in germany 's parliament often remain empty as legislators have other obligations röttgen would certainly be an asset for bdi , henkel said .
but his simultaneous role as legislator and lobbyist represents a conflict of interest , he added , citing another parliamentarian who moonlights as general manager of the confederation of german employers ' associations as a bad precedent .
henkel also said that the bdi job was simply too demanding . " you ca n't just run off to parliamentary hearings , " he said , adding that he 's generally in favor of encouraging parliamentarians to work on the side in order to keep them grounded in society . a n eed for tra n spare n cy that 's a view shared by many , including members of the german chapter of corruption watchdog transparency international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's not quite as colorful and diverse as the lamps in its cafeteria " we need the know-how of people who have a professional career , " said jochen bäumel , a board member of the organization , adding that the additional income and business interests of lawmakers should be made public to create more transparency for voters . parliamentarians actually approved a new code of conduct last year .
it requires publication of the source and level of extra income .
all legislators had to hand over that information to parliamentary president norbert lammert by the end of march .
but lammert decided to delay publication until germany 's highest court has ruled on a complaint against the plan that was filed by six lawmakers . fuelli n g e n vy ? " publicizing side income can not make transparent any potential conflicts of interest - it only fuels feelings of envy , " said hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party and one of the plaintiffs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing professional and political work is what 's important , according to otto a lawyer and notary , otto said that he spends a quarter to a third of his time working in his old profession , but categorically rejects cases that have anything to do with his work as a parliamentarian . " it makes me more independent and offers me indispensable practical experience , " he said , adding that while he disapproves of secondary full-time jobs such as the one sought by röttgen , he thinks that more of his colleagues should keep working on the side . " we need successful , experienced people here , " said otto , who approves of publishing general information about side jobs , such as the type of work and memberships in supervisory boards .
" but publicizing -lrb- extra income -rrb- will prevent them from coming . " a ba n o n side jobs ? others said that financial interests should not become the decisive factor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to voters to renew legislators ' contracts " a political mandate is n't just about monetary rewards , it 's about being able to make a difference , " said ulrich eith , a political scientist at freiburg university , who rejected the argument that legislators had to keep working in their profession since they had no guarantee of re-election . " if i start a job at a company tomorrow , i also wo n't get any guarantees that i will be able to remain there for the rest of my life , " he said . the publication of extra income was the minimum voters should demand , eith added . " i do n't see why parliamentarians should have side jobs when they are paid appropriately , " he said . the citize n calls the tu n e that 's a sentiment echoed by michael hartmann , a social democratic parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for the german people , " reads the text above the parliament 's entrance " i 'm paid by the citizens and they call the tune , " he said , adding that as a former government spokesman in the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , he is in a privileged position as he can return to his old job should voters oust him in 2009 . with a work week of 60 to 80 hours , hartmann said he did n't have time to take on other work , but added that he was not generally opposed to legislators taking on part-time jobs on the side as long as they publicized it according to the new code of conduct . " that 's something we have to endure , " he said .

while most feel he should leave parliament , side jobs for parliamentarians in general remain a hot-button issue . norbert röttgen has little time to spare .
during a typical week , the member of germany 's parliament spends about 60 hours representing his constituents - and that 's not counting weekends , when he 's back in his district attending events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert röttgen has so far served as his party 's parliamentary manager but despite his full workload , the 40-year-old christian democrat , who is often described as a " close confidante " of chancellor angela merkel , now plans to take on another job : next january , he 's expected to become general manager of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , which represents the interests of german businesses . as a result , röttgen said he wo n't seek re-election to parliament in 2009 .
but citing a responsibility to the people who elected him , the lawmaker intends to keep his mandate until then . a co n flict of i n terest a n d too much work while many german parliamentarians - unlike us lawmakers , for example - keep working part-time in their professions while in office , a second full-time job remains the exception .
that 's why röttgen 's move has provoked criticism from across the political spectrum and even a former bdi president . " i would have never tolerated this , " said hans-olaf henkel , who headed the organization between 1995 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seats in germany 's parliament often remain empty as legislators have other obligations röttgen would certainly be an asset for bdi , henkel said .
but his simultaneous role as legislator and lobbyist represents a conflict of interest , he added , citing another parliamentarian who moonlights as general manager of the confederation of german employers ' associations as a bad precedent .
henkel also said that the bdi job was simply too demanding . " you ca n't just run off to parliamentary hearings , " he said , adding that he 's generally in favor of encouraging parliamentarians to work on the side in order to keep them grounded in society . a n eed for tra n spare n cy that 's a view shared by many , including members of the german chapter of corruption watchdog transparency international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's not quite as colorful and diverse as the lamps in its cafeteria " we need the know-how of people who have a professional career , " said jochen bäumel , a board member of the organization , adding that the additional income and business interests of lawmakers should be made public to create more transparency for voters . parliamentarians actually approved a new code of conduct last year .
it requires publication of the source and level of extra income .
all legislators had to hand over that information to parliamentary president norbert lammert by the end of march .
but lammert decided to delay publication until germany 's highest court has ruled on a complaint against the plan that was filed by six lawmakers . fuelli n g e n vy ?

" we will fully respect the result of the referendum , " said solana , who helped set the conditions under which the plebiscite would be held . he said it was too early to comment further , although he congratulated the montenegrins for turning out to vote in great number : 87 percent of those eligible cast their ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana " this is a sign of maturity , " he told reporters in brussels . solana led moves in 2003 for a constitution to be drawn up for the loose federation of serbia and montenegro .
a key part of it was an escape clause that allowed the referendum on independence after three years . it was also the eu 's top diplomat who was behind the conditions laid down for the vote ; that of a 55 percent benchmark for it being accepted and on the provision that more than 50 percent of people take part . fair electio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegrins have already taken to flying their flag " the commission is pleased to note the preliminary report that the referendum in montenegro was carried out in a calm manner and with a high turnout , which is important for the legitimacy of the vote , " a spokesman added . officials for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- also hailed the conduct of montenegro 's referendum as in line with democratic standards . " overall the referendum was conducted in line with osce , council of europe and other international standards for democratic electoral process , " said nedzat yalcintas of the osce . a n eu future ? separately , the european commission , the eu 's executive body , called on all sides in the tiny balkans state to respect the final results .
eu officials also said that it was willing to enter into negotiations for a stabilization and association agreement - a crucial step towards eu membership - with montenegro .
they said that the new country faced a " great challenge " to modernize its administration in order to enable it to engage in negotiations with brussels . negotiations with serbia-montenegro were recently halted because of serbia 's failure to comply with demands by the international war crimes tribunal to hand over war crimes suspect ratko mladic , the leader of the bosnian serb army during the war . timeli n e for i n depe n de n ce montenegrin prime minister milo djukanovic already proclaimed victory for the pro-independence camp early monday before the official result was announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milo djukanovic " ladies and gentlemen , let me tell you that tonight , by the decision of the people of montenegro , an independent montenegro has been renewed , " a jubilant djukanovic told his supporters .
" this is the most important day in the history of montenegro , " said the long-time advocate of independence , who added that his motive for creating a separate state was a desire not to be dominated by serbia , which has a population more than 10 times the size of montenegro 's 650,000 . the montenegrin parliament will now have to declare independence within 15 days of receiving the official results of sunday 's referendum .
the serbian parliament will also have to proclaim the republic 's own independence .
after the independence declarations , the union between the two republics automatically ceases to exist . the breakup of the federation is unlikely to affect the two independent economic systems of serbia and montenegro , as they have already been operating separately for three years .

according to reports , us officials plan the base as protection against an iranian attack . " the location of this us anti-rocket base on the territory of some european state is just an idea , there is no concrete proposal , " andrej cirtek , a spokesman for the czech ministry of defense , told afp on monday . cirtek was responding to an article in monday 's edition of the new york times that said us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was expected to make a recommendation this summer on the site for the europe-based defense system .
the czech republic and poland are both under consideration , the paper reported . should the system be based in poland , it would be the first permanent us military installation in the former communist country .

us department of defense officials have reportedly already asked congress to approve $ 56 million in initial funding for the project . the washi n gto n times and i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e reported in march that a deal on the anti-missile site was close to being signed . the latest new york times article , citing unnamed pentagon officials , said the missiles based at the site would protect the us and its european allies from iranian attack .
so far , anti-missile systems exist in alaska and california and are meant to protect the us against an attack from north korea . lo n g-term project cirtek said the anti-missile site has been the subject of discussions between experts from us and their european counterparts at nato for several years . " as for a concrete project , there is nothing to negotiate , " he added . bildunterschrift : czech leaders in prague would have to approve the project establishment of a foreign base on czech soil would require approval from more than half of the total number of elected representatives in both houses of the czech parliament , the lower house and the senate , cirtek added . the czech republic is currently in the throes of a general election with polling on june 2 and 3 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans may aid us firms with ' star wars ' american defense contractors lockheed martin and northrop grumman say they will cooperate closely with european companies on the development of george w. bush 's so-called " star wars " missile defense system .

" we will fully respect the result of the referendum , " said solana , who helped set the conditions under which the plebiscite would be held . he said it was too early to comment further , although he congratulated the montenegrins for turning out to vote in great number : 87 percent of those eligible cast their ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana " this is a sign of maturity , " he told reporters in brussels . solana led moves in 2003 for a constitution to be drawn up for the loose federation of serbia and montenegro .
a key part of it was an escape clause that allowed the referendum on independence after three years . it was also the eu 's top diplomat who was behind the conditions laid down for the vote ; that of a 55 percent benchmark for it being accepted and on the provision that more than 50 percent of people take part . fair electio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegrins have already taken to flying their flag " the commission is pleased to note the preliminary report that the referendum in montenegro was carried out in a calm manner and with a high turnout , which is important for the legitimacy of the vote , " a spokesman added . officials for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- also hailed the conduct of montenegro 's referendum as in line with democratic standards .

eu officials also said that it was willing to enter into negotiations for a stabilization and association agreement - a crucial step towards eu membership - with montenegro .
they said that the new country faced a " great challenge " to modernize its administration in order to enable it to engage in negotiations with brussels . negotiations with serbia-montenegro were recently halted because of serbia 's failure to comply with demands by the international war crimes tribunal to hand over war crimes suspect ratko mladic , the leader of the bosnian serb army during the war . timeli n e for i n depe n de n ce montenegrin prime minister milo djukanovic already proclaimed victory for the pro-independence camp early monday before the official result was announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milo djukanovic " ladies and gentlemen , let me tell you that tonight , by the decision of the people of montenegro , an independent montenegro has been renewed , " a jubilant djukanovic told his supporters .
" this is the most important day in the history of montenegro , " said the long-time advocate of independence , who added that his motive for creating a separate state was a desire not to be dominated by serbia , which has a population more than 10 times the size of montenegro 's 650,000 . the montenegrin parliament will now have to declare independence within 15 days of receiving the official results of sunday 's referendum .
the serbian parliament will also have to proclaim the republic 's own independence .
after the independence declarations , the union between the two republics automatically ceases to exist . the breakup of the federation is unlikely to affect the two independent economic systems of serbia and montenegro , as they have already been operating separately for three years .

and topics like human rights and iran 's status as a nuclear power were also on the agenda . most of all , though , the visit was about two governments getting to know each other .
it was the chancellor 's first visit to china since taking office a half a year ago . the 63 year old wen clearly took to merkel , saying she brought a " friendly wind " to beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles soon made way for hard talking for her part , merkel said germany 's relationship with china was good , but there was room for improvement . after the discussions in beijing , merkel and wen announced that germany and china had agreed that iran should not be allowed to build nuclear weapons .
however , despite the rather obvious and expected consensus , there was no mention of any progress in decreasing the divisions over what action should be taken to enforce it . agreeme n t o n weapo n s but n o co n se n sus o n actio n " we talked about iran and both -lrb- of us -rrb- agreed iran should not have the capability to make nuclear weapons and should n't proliferate weapons of mass destruction , " merkel told a joint press conference with wen . chancellor merkel also chose to bring up the topic of china 's human rights record , an issue that critics in germany have pushed merkel to address and one that her predecessor gerhard schröder was loath to do on his visits to the people 's republic . " it 's an important issue of bilateral dialogue , " merkel told the assembled press after talks at the great hall of the people .
she did not go into details on whether she brought up any specific human rights cases but added : " i have made it clear that human rights are indivisible . " merkel is critical of efforts within the european union to lift the ban on arms sales to beijing without first securing guarantees on human rights reforms in china . pirated goods a n d price dumpi n g co n cer n s addressed trade between germany and china was also on the agenda .
bilateral trade reached 49.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.2 billion -rrb- last year , making germany china 's largest trading partner in the european union .
but even so there were still a few hot topics the chancellor chose to bring up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate goods from china cost the global economy billions fake goods and the protection of intellectual property rights is a chronic irritant in trade relations between the two countries and merkel , who was accompanied by a 40-strong delegation of german business leaders and economics minister michael glos , urged the chinese to take stronger measures to curtail a counterfeit industry which cost global business around 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- a year . " because we are technological leaders in many areas , protection of intellectual property is crucial to our success , " merkel told the fourth meeting of the high-technology dialogue forum , attended by over 300 german and chinese business and industry representatives .
" but i observe with great interest the rise in china 's technological capacities , " she said .
" that should give china a higher stake in effectively protecting intellectual property . " premier wen jiabao conceded there are still " many problems " in the area .

and topics like human rights and iran 's status as a nuclear power were also on the agenda . most of all , though , the visit was about two governments getting to know each other .
it was the chancellor 's first visit to china since taking office a half a year ago . the 63 year old wen clearly took to merkel , saying she brought a " friendly wind " to beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles soon made way for hard talking for her part , merkel said germany 's relationship with china was good , but there was room for improvement . after the discussions in beijing , merkel and wen announced that germany and china had agreed that iran should not be allowed to build nuclear weapons .

" it 's an important issue of bilateral dialogue , " merkel told the assembled press after talks at the great hall of the people .
she did not go into details on whether she brought up any specific human rights cases but added : " i have made it clear that human rights are indivisible .

bilateral trade reached 49.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.2 billion -rrb- last year , making germany china 's largest trading partner in the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.05.2006 moonlighting mp rekindles calls for " transparent legislators " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most agree that voters deserve clarity about side jobs of legislators a german lawmaker has been criticized for planning to moonlight as manager of a business lobbying group .
while most feel he should leave parliament , side jobs for parliamentarians in general remain a hot-button issue . norbert röttgen has little time to spare .
during a typical week , the member of germany 's parliament spends about 60 hours representing his constituents - and that 's not counting weekends , when he 's back in his district attending events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert röttgen has so far served as his party 's parliamentary manager but despite his full workload , the 40-year-old christian democrat , who is often described as a " close confidante " of chancellor angela merkel , now plans to take on another job : next january , he 's expected to become general manager of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , which represents the interests of german businesses . as a result , röttgen said he wo n't seek re-election to parliament in 2009 .
but citing a responsibility to the people who elected him , the lawmaker intends to keep his mandate until then . a co n flict of i n terest a n d too much work while many german parliamentarians - unlike us lawmakers , for example - keep working part-time in their professions while in office , a second full-time job remains the exception .
that 's why röttgen 's move has provoked criticism from across the political spectrum and even a former bdi president . " i would have never tolerated this , " said hans-olaf henkel , who headed the organization between 1995 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seats in germany 's parliament often remain empty as legislators have other obligations röttgen would certainly be an asset for bdi , henkel said .

and british newcomer andrea arnold and her film " red road " is anticipated as a surprise hit . " america is really performing badly this year , " mark cousins , a film expert and author told reuters .

11 terrorist attacks are being well-received but the film , which goes on release in august just ahead of the fifth anniversary of the attacks in which nearly 3,000 people died , remains so sensitive that paramount pictures has written to theaters warning them that the trailers are now being screened . as the clip ended in cannes with a shot of nicolas cage 's eyes blinking open in the dark , there was a sharp intake of breath and then applause for stone . paul greengrass ' " united 93 " is also to be shown here , telling the story of a fourth plane bound for washington , which crashed into a field in pennsylvania after a passenger uprising . in march , one new york cinema stopped showing a preview for the film because of the audience 's negative response to it .

" we will fully respect the result of the referendum , " said solana , who helped set the conditions under which the plebiscite would be held . he said it was too early to comment further , although he congratulated the montenegrins for turning out to vote in great number : 87 percent of those eligible cast their ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana " this is a sign of maturity , " he told reporters in brussels . solana led moves in 2003 for a constitution to be drawn up for the loose federation of serbia and montenegro .
a key part of it was an escape clause that allowed the referendum on independence after three years . it was also the eu 's top diplomat who was behind the conditions laid down for the vote ; that of a 55 percent benchmark for it being accepted and on the provision that more than 50 percent of people take part . fair electio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegrins have already taken to flying their flag " the commission is pleased to note the preliminary report that the referendum in montenegro was carried out in a calm manner and with a high turnout , which is important for the legitimacy of the vote , " a spokesman added . officials for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- also hailed the conduct of montenegro 's referendum as in line with democratic standards . " overall the referendum was conducted in line with osce , council of europe and other international standards for democratic electoral process , " said nedzat yalcintas of the osce . a n eu future ? separately , the european commission , the eu 's executive body , called on all sides in the tiny balkans state to respect the final results .
eu officials also said that it was willing to enter into negotiations for a stabilization and association agreement - a crucial step towards eu membership - with montenegro .
they said that the new country faced a " great challenge " to modernize its administration in order to enable it to engage in negotiations with brussels . negotiations with serbia-montenegro were recently halted because of serbia 's failure to comply with demands by the international war crimes tribunal to hand over war crimes suspect ratko mladic , the leader of the bosnian serb army during the war . timeli n e for i n depe n de n ce montenegrin prime minister milo djukanovic already proclaimed victory for the pro-independence camp early monday before the official result was announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milo djukanovic " ladies and gentlemen , let me tell you that tonight , by the decision of the people of montenegro , an independent montenegro has been renewed , " a jubilant djukanovic told his supporters .
" this is the most important day in the history of montenegro , " said the long-time advocate of independence , who added that his motive for creating a separate state was a desire not to be dominated by serbia , which has a population more than 10 times the size of montenegro 's 650,000 . the montenegrin parliament will now have to declare independence within 15 days of receiving the official results of sunday 's referendum .
the serbian parliament will also have to proclaim the republic 's own independence .
after the independence declarations , the union between the two republics automatically ceases to exist . the breakup of the federation is unlikely to affect the two independent economic systems of serbia and montenegro , as they have already been operating separately for three years .
montenegro adopted the german mark and then the euro as its official currency years ago , while serbia still uses the dinar . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenges of integrating southeast europe both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way .

the result is the latest setback to the united nations plan to re-unify the island , and could even undermine turkish efforts to join the european union . half a million greek cypriots took to the polls to elect 56 representatives .
it was their first chance to pick mps since a referendum on reunification was rejected in 2004 .
it was also the first time in decades that some 270 of the ethnic turks living in the greek-held part of cyprus were allowed to vote and contest the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of communistic party akel celebrating their party 's victory results show the governing coalition , which ran on an anti-reunification platform , gained support at the polls .
president tassos papadopoulos ' diko party won 18 percent of the vote - up 3 percent on its last showing - while his allies from the communist akel party won 31 percent .
the pro-reunification opposition party , the disy , lost ground to come a close second with 30 percent of the vote . un proposal doomed ? greek and turkish cypriots have lived divided since turkey invaded cyprus 's north in 1974 in response to a brief greek-inspired coup .

" i have to admit that after two and a half years of negotiations , we are not as far along as we would like to be , " steinmeier said when asked about european efforts to convince iran to halt uranium enrichment .
" the situation requires not only creativity on our part , but also more flexibility on the iranian side , " he said at a joint press conference with his kuwaiti counterpart sheikh mohammed al-sabah al-salem . " the kuwaitis ' concerns - and not only the kuwaitis , but of all the gulf states - are obvious , " salem said , reflecting the gulf monarchs ' bid to remain neutral while preferring to avoid any military confrontation in the region . " there are real concerns in the gulf in terms of iran 's nuclear activities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier britain , france and germany are preparing a package of trade , technology and security benefits if tehran stops enriching uranium , a process which creates fuel for power plants but can also form the core of a nuclear bomb . a draft proposal by the so-called eu-3 says world powers should support iran 's building several light water reactors and set up a nuclear fuel bank that would guarantee the country access to reactor fuel but not the sensitive fuel cycle technology . split with washington but the eu 's offer of incentives to iran has caused a split with washington , which has serious reservations about the plan , eu diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state condoleezza rice in talks about iran at the un on sunday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said that the united states was not prepared to offer security guarantees to iran in order to end the dispute . " security assurances are not on the table , " rice told the fox news . " it 's obvious that in addition to the nuclear issue , we have other issues with iran .
we have a state in iran that is devoted to the destruction of israel .
we have a state in iran that meddles in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- peace process , " she said . rice also denied that the eu3 of britain , france and germany had asked washington to provide guarantees that no threat would be made to the iranian government . " first of all , let me just set the record straight .
we have n't been asked to provide security assurances to iran , " she said . " what we 're talking about is a package that will make clear to iran that there are choices to be made , either that there will be sanctions and actions taken against iran by the international community , or there 's a way for them to meet their civil nuclear concerns . " iran remains stubborn iran vowed again on sunday it would not suspend uranium enrichment . iran says it wants to enrich only to make reactor fuel but the us in particular accuses iran of using an atomic energy drive as a cover for acquiring an atomic bomb . steinmeier arrived in kuwait late saturday on the first leg of a six-country gulf tour that comes amid a growing international crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions . he was to arrive in oman later sunday .

the czech republic has received " no concrete proposal " from the us for locating an anti ´ -missile defense base on czech soil .
according to reports , us officials plan the base as protection against an iranian attack . " the location of this us anti-rocket base on the territory of some european state is just an idea , there is no concrete proposal , " andrej cirtek , a spokesman for the czech ministry of defense , told afp on monday . cirtek was responding to an article in monday 's edition of the new york times that said us defense secretary donald rumsfeld was expected to make a recommendation this summer on the site for the europe-based defense system .
the czech republic and poland are both under consideration , the paper reported . should the system be based in poland , it would be the first permanent us military installation in the former communist country .

so far , anti-missile systems exist in alaska and california and are meant to protect the us against an attack from north korea . lo n g-term project cirtek said the anti-missile site has been the subject of discussions between experts from us and their european counterparts at nato for several years . " as for a concrete project , there is nothing to negotiate , " he added . bildunterschrift : czech leaders in prague would have to approve the project establishment of a foreign base on czech soil would require approval from more than half of the total number of elected representatives in both houses of the czech parliament , the lower house and the senate , cirtek added . the czech republic is currently in the throes of a general election with polling on june 2 and 3 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans may aid us firms with ' star wars ' american defense contractors lockheed martin and northrop grumman say they will cooperate closely with european companies on the development of george w. bush 's so-called " star wars " missile defense system .

and topics like human rights and iran 's status as a nuclear power were also on the agenda . most of all , though , the visit was about two governments getting to know each other .
it was the chancellor 's first visit to china since taking office a half a year ago . the 63 year old wen clearly took to merkel , saying she brought a " friendly wind " to beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles soon made way for hard talking for her part , merkel said germany 's relationship with china was good , but there was room for improvement . after the discussions in beijing , merkel and wen announced that germany and china had agreed that iran should not be allowed to build nuclear weapons .
however , despite the rather obvious and expected consensus , there was no mention of any progress in decreasing the divisions over what action should be taken to enforce it . agreeme n t o n weapo n s but n o co n se n sus o n actio n " we talked about iran and both -lrb- of us -rrb- agreed iran should not have the capability to make nuclear weapons and should n't proliferate weapons of mass destruction , " merkel told a joint press conference with wen . chancellor merkel also chose to bring up the topic of china 's human rights record , an issue that critics in germany have pushed merkel to address and one that her predecessor gerhard schröder was loath to do on his visits to the people 's republic . " it 's an important issue of bilateral dialogue , " merkel told the assembled press after talks at the great hall of the people .
she did not go into details on whether she brought up any specific human rights cases but added : " i have made it clear that human rights are indivisible . " merkel is critical of efforts within the european union to lift the ban on arms sales to beijing without first securing guarantees on human rights reforms in china . pirated goods a n d price dumpi n g co n cer n s addressed trade between germany and china was also on the agenda .
bilateral trade reached 49.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.2 billion -rrb- last year , making germany china 's largest trading partner in the european union .
but even so there were still a few hot topics the chancellor chose to bring up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate goods from china cost the global economy billions fake goods and the protection of intellectual property rights is a chronic irritant in trade relations between the two countries and merkel , who was accompanied by a 40-strong delegation of german business leaders and economics minister michael glos , urged the chinese to take stronger measures to curtail a counterfeit industry which cost global business around 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- a year . " because we are technological leaders in many areas , protection of intellectual property is crucial to our success , " merkel told the fourth meeting of the high-technology dialogue forum , attended by over 300 german and chinese business and industry representatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.05.2006 moonlighting mp rekindles calls for " transparent legislators " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most agree that voters deserve clarity about side jobs of legislators a german lawmaker has been criticized for planning to moonlight as manager of a business lobbying group .
while most feel he should leave parliament , side jobs for parliamentarians in general remain a hot-button issue . norbert röttgen has little time to spare .
during a typical week , the member of germany 's parliament spends about 60 hours representing his constituents - and that 's not counting weekends , when he 's back in his district attending events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert röttgen has so far served as his party 's parliamentary manager but despite his full workload , the 40-year-old christian democrat , who is often described as a " close confidante " of chancellor angela merkel , now plans to take on another job : next january , he 's expected to become general manager of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , which represents the interests of german businesses . as a result , röttgen said he wo n't seek re-election to parliament in 2009 .
but citing a responsibility to the people who elected him , the lawmaker intends to keep his mandate until then . a co n flict of i n terest a n d too much work while many german parliamentarians - unlike us lawmakers , for example - keep working part-time in their professions while in office , a second full-time job remains the exception .
that 's why röttgen 's move has provoked criticism from across the political spectrum and even a former bdi president . " i would have never tolerated this , " said hans-olaf henkel , who headed the organization between 1995 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seats in germany 's parliament often remain empty as legislators have other obligations röttgen would certainly be an asset for bdi , henkel said .
but his simultaneous role as legislator and lobbyist represents a conflict of interest , he added , citing another parliamentarian who moonlights as general manager of the confederation of german employers ' associations as a bad precedent .
henkel also said that the bdi job was simply too demanding . " you ca n't just run off to parliamentary hearings , " he said , adding that he 's generally in favor of encouraging parliamentarians to work on the side in order to keep them grounded in society . a n eed for tra n spare n cy that 's a view shared by many , including members of the german chapter of corruption watchdog transparency international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's not quite as colorful and diverse as the lamps in its cafeteria " we need the know-how of people who have a professional career , " said jochen bäumel , a board member of the organization , adding that the additional income and business interests of lawmakers should be made public to create more transparency for voters . parliamentarians actually approved a new code of conduct last year .
it requires publication of the source and level of extra income .
all legislators had to hand over that information to parliamentary president norbert lammert by the end of march .
but lammert decided to delay publication until germany 's highest court has ruled on a complaint against the plan that was filed by six lawmakers . fuelli n g e n vy ? " publicizing side income can not make transparent any potential conflicts of interest - it only fuels feelings of envy , " said hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party and one of the plaintiffs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing professional and political work is what 's important , according to otto a lawyer and notary , otto said that he spends a quarter to a third of his time working in his old profession , but categorically rejects cases that have anything to do with his work as a parliamentarian . " it makes me more independent and offers me indispensable practical experience , " he said , adding that while he disapproves of secondary full-time jobs such as the one sought by röttgen , he thinks that more of his colleagues should keep working on the side . " we need successful , experienced people here , " said otto , who approves of publishing general information about side jobs , such as the type of work and memberships in supervisory boards .
" but publicizing -lrb- extra income -rrb- will prevent them from coming . " a ba n o n side jobs ? others said that financial interests should not become the decisive factor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to voters to renew legislators ' contracts " a political mandate is n't just about monetary rewards , it 's about being able to make a difference , " said ulrich eith , a political scientist at freiburg university , who rejected the argument that legislators had to keep working in their profession since they had no guarantee of re-election . " if i start a job at a company tomorrow , i also wo n't get any guarantees that i will be able to remain there for the rest of my life , " he said . the publication of extra income was the minimum voters should demand , eith added . " i do n't see why parliamentarians should have side jobs when they are paid appropriately , " he said . the citize n calls the tu n e that 's a sentiment echoed by michael hartmann , a social democratic parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for the german people , " reads the text above the parliament 's entrance " i 'm paid by the citizens and they call the tune , " he said , adding that as a former government spokesman in the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , he is in a privileged position as he can return to his old job should voters oust him in 2009 . with a work week of 60 to 80 hours , hartmann said he did n't have time to take on other work , but added that he was not generally opposed to legislators taking on part-time jobs on the side as long as they publicized it according to the new code of conduct . " that 's something we have to endure , " he said .

while most feel he should leave parliament , side jobs for parliamentarians in general remain a hot-button issue . norbert röttgen has little time to spare .
during a typical week , the member of germany 's parliament spends about 60 hours representing his constituents - and that 's not counting weekends , when he 's back in his district attending events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert röttgen has so far served as his party 's parliamentary manager but despite his full workload , the 40-year-old christian democrat , who is often described as a " close confidante " of chancellor angela merkel , now plans to take on another job : next january , he 's expected to become general manager of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , which represents the interests of german businesses . as a result , röttgen said he wo n't seek re-election to parliament in 2009 .
but citing a responsibility to the people who elected him , the lawmaker intends to keep his mandate until then . a co n flict of i n terest a n d too much work while many german parliamentarians - unlike us lawmakers , for example - keep working part-time in their professions while in office , a second full-time job remains the exception .
that 's why röttgen 's move has provoked criticism from across the political spectrum and even a former bdi president . " i would have never tolerated this , " said hans-olaf henkel , who headed the organization between 1995 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seats in germany 's parliament often remain empty as legislators have other obligations röttgen would certainly be an asset for bdi , henkel said .
but his simultaneous role as legislator and lobbyist represents a conflict of interest , he added , citing another parliamentarian who moonlights as general manager of the confederation of german employers ' associations as a bad precedent .
henkel also said that the bdi job was simply too demanding . " you ca n't just run off to parliamentary hearings , " he said , adding that he 's generally in favor of encouraging parliamentarians to work on the side in order to keep them grounded in society . a n eed for tra n spare n cy that 's a view shared by many , including members of the german chapter of corruption watchdog transparency international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's not quite as colorful and diverse as the lamps in its cafeteria " we need the know-how of people who have a professional career , " said jochen bäumel , a board member of the organization , adding that the additional income and business interests of lawmakers should be made public to create more transparency for voters . parliamentarians actually approved a new code of conduct last year .
it requires publication of the source and level of extra income .
all legislators had to hand over that information to parliamentary president norbert lammert by the end of march .
but lammert decided to delay publication until germany 's highest court has ruled on a complaint against the plan that was filed by six lawmakers . fuelli n g e n vy ? " publicizing side income can not make transparent any potential conflicts of interest - it only fuels feelings of envy , " said hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party and one of the plaintiffs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing professional and political work is what 's important , according to otto a lawyer and notary , otto said that he spends a quarter to a third of his time working in his old profession , but categorically rejects cases that have anything to do with his work as a parliamentarian . " it makes me more independent and offers me indispensable practical experience , " he said , adding that while he disapproves of secondary full-time jobs such as the one sought by röttgen , he thinks that more of his colleagues should keep working on the side . " we need successful , experienced people here , " said otto , who approves of publishing general information about side jobs , such as the type of work and memberships in supervisory boards .
" but publicizing -lrb- extra income -rrb- will prevent them from coming . " a ba n o n side jobs ? others said that financial interests should not become the decisive factor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to voters to renew legislators ' contracts " a political mandate is n't just about monetary rewards , it 's about being able to make a difference , " said ulrich eith , a political scientist at freiburg university , who rejected the argument that legislators had to keep working in their profession since they had no guarantee of re-election . " if i start a job at a company tomorrow , i also wo n't get any guarantees that i will be able to remain there for the rest of my life , " he said . the publication of extra income was the minimum voters should demand , eith added . " i do n't see why parliamentarians should have side jobs when they are paid appropriately , " he said . the citize n calls the tu n e that 's a sentiment echoed by michael hartmann , a social democratic parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for the german people , " reads the text above the parliament 's entrance " i 'm paid by the citizens and they call the tune , " he said , adding that as a former government spokesman in the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , he is in a privileged position as he can return to his old job should voters oust him in 2009 . with a work week of 60 to 80 hours , hartmann said he did n't have time to take on other work , but added that he was not generally opposed to legislators taking on part-time jobs on the side as long as they publicized it according to the new code of conduct . " that 's something we have to endure , " he said .

" we will fully respect the result of the referendum , " said solana , who helped set the conditions under which the plebiscite would be held . he said it was too early to comment further , although he congratulated the montenegrins for turning out to vote in great number : 87 percent of those eligible cast their ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana " this is a sign of maturity , " he told reporters in brussels . solana led moves in 2003 for a constitution to be drawn up for the loose federation of serbia and montenegro .
a key part of it was an escape clause that allowed the referendum on independence after three years . it was also the eu 's top diplomat who was behind the conditions laid down for the vote ; that of a 55 percent benchmark for it being accepted and on the provision that more than 50 percent of people take part . fair electio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegrins have already taken to flying their flag " the commission is pleased to note the preliminary report that the referendum in montenegro was carried out in a calm manner and with a high turnout , which is important for the legitimacy of the vote , " a spokesman added . officials for the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- also hailed the conduct of montenegro 's referendum as in line with democratic standards . " overall the referendum was conducted in line with osce , council of europe and other international standards for democratic electoral process , " said nedzat yalcintas of the osce . a n eu future ? separately , the european commission , the eu 's executive body , called on all sides in the tiny balkans state to respect the final results .
eu officials also said that it was willing to enter into negotiations for a stabilization and association agreement - a crucial step towards eu membership - with montenegro .
they said that the new country faced a " great challenge " to modernize its administration in order to enable it to engage in negotiations with brussels . negotiations with serbia-montenegro were recently halted because of serbia 's failure to comply with demands by the international war crimes tribunal to hand over war crimes suspect ratko mladic , the leader of the bosnian serb army during the war . timeli n e for i n depe n de n ce montenegrin prime minister milo djukanovic already proclaimed victory for the pro-independence camp early monday before the official result was announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milo djukanovic " ladies and gentlemen , let me tell you that tonight , by the decision of the people of montenegro , an independent montenegro has been renewed , " a jubilant djukanovic told his supporters .
" this is the most important day in the history of montenegro , " said the long-time advocate of independence , who added that his motive for creating a separate state was a desire not to be dominated by serbia , which has a population more than 10 times the size of montenegro 's 650,000 . the montenegrin parliament will now have to declare independence within 15 days of receiving the official results of sunday 's referendum .
the serbian parliament will also have to proclaim the republic 's own independence .
after the independence declarations , the union between the two republics automatically ceases to exist . the breakup of the federation is unlikely to affect the two independent economic systems of serbia and montenegro , as they have already been operating separately for three years .
montenegro adopted the german mark and then the euro as its official currency years ago , while serbia still uses the dinar . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenges of integrating southeast europe both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .

and topics like human rights and iran 's status as a nuclear power were also on the agenda . most of all , though , the visit was about two governments getting to know each other .
it was the chancellor 's first visit to china since taking office a half a year ago . the 63 year old wen clearly took to merkel , saying she brought a " friendly wind " to beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles soon made way for hard talking for her part , merkel said germany 's relationship with china was good , but there was room for improvement . after the discussions in beijing , merkel and wen announced that germany and china had agreed that iran should not be allowed to build nuclear weapons .
however , despite the rather obvious and expected consensus , there was no mention of any progress in decreasing the divisions over what action should be taken to enforce it . agreeme n t o n weapo n s but n o co n se n sus o n actio n " we talked about iran and both -lrb- of us -rrb- agreed iran should not have the capability to make nuclear weapons and should n't proliferate weapons of mass destruction , " merkel told a joint press conference with wen . chancellor merkel also chose to bring up the topic of china 's human rights record , an issue that critics in germany have pushed merkel to address and one that her predecessor gerhard schröder was loath to do on his visits to the people 's republic . " it 's an important issue of bilateral dialogue , " merkel told the assembled press after talks at the great hall of the people .
she did not go into details on whether she brought up any specific human rights cases but added : " i have made it clear that human rights are indivisible . " merkel is critical of efforts within the european union to lift the ban on arms sales to beijing without first securing guarantees on human rights reforms in china . pirated goods a n d price dumpi n g co n cer n s addressed trade between germany and china was also on the agenda .
bilateral trade reached 49.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.2 billion -rrb- last year , making germany china 's largest trading partner in the european union .
but even so there were still a few hot topics the chancellor chose to bring up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate goods from china cost the global economy billions fake goods and the protection of intellectual property rights is a chronic irritant in trade relations between the two countries and merkel , who was accompanied by a 40-strong delegation of german business leaders and economics minister michael glos , urged the chinese to take stronger measures to curtail a counterfeit industry which cost global business around 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- a year . " because we are technological leaders in many areas , protection of intellectual property is crucial to our success , " merkel told the fourth meeting of the high-technology dialogue forum , attended by over 300 german and chinese business and industry representatives .
" but i observe with great interest the rise in china 's technological capacities , " she said .
" that should give china a higher stake in effectively protecting intellectual property . " premier wen jiabao conceded there are still " many problems " in the area .
" the protection of intellectual property is not only an international duty for us , but it also serves the interests of china , " mr wen said , adding that his government was considering both " administrative " and " judicial " tools to better protect companies ' proprietary information . german industrialists , who have often complained about the lax enforcement of china 's anti-piracy laws , say chinese regulations actually encourage intellectual property theft by forcing german companies to reveal highly detailed proprietary information about their technologies , for instance when bidding for public tenders . an agreement between german and chinese textile industry representatives against product piracy that would punish companies that make counterfeit textiles is expected to be signed during merkel 's visit . the german contingent were also expected to discuss the the eu 's anti-dumping tariffs on clothing and footwear with their chinese counterparts , a contentious issue which has been threatening to spill over into a full-scale trade war . leaders sig n railway deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technology will be applied to a new generation of trains the two nations did agree on a deal which would see germany 's siemens , china 's ministry of railways and chinese firm csr zhuzhou electric locomotive work together on the building of 500 chinese trains , although no details about the timing or extent of cooperation were given in the agreement or by chinese officials . siemens president and chief executive officer klaus kleinfeld told reporters after the memorandum of understanding was signed that the total value of the project could be worth 1.2 billion euros . in shanghai on tuesday , merkel planned to look at germany 's favorite export object , the transrapid rail line . dw staff -lrb- nda / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a flawed sino-german business connection product piracy is high on the agenda of german chancellor angela merkel 's current trip to china .

the result is the latest setback to the united nations plan to re-unify the island , and could even undermine turkish efforts to join the european union . half a million greek cypriots took to the polls to elect 56 representatives .
it was their first chance to pick mps since a referendum on reunification was rejected in 2004 .

the result is the latest setback to the united nations plan to re-unify the island , and could even undermine turkish efforts to join the european union . half a million greek cypriots took to the polls to elect 56 representatives .
it was their first chance to pick mps since a referendum on reunification was rejected in 2004 .
it was also the first time in decades that some 270 of the ethnic turks living in the greek-held part of cyprus were allowed to vote and contest the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of communistic party akel celebrating their party 's victory results show the governing coalition , which ran on an anti-reunification platform , gained support at the polls .
president tassos papadopoulos ' diko party won 18 percent of the vote - up 3 percent on its last showing - while his allies from the communist akel party won 31 percent .
the pro-reunification opposition party , the disy , lost ground to come a close second with 30 percent of the vote . un proposal doomed ? greek and turkish cypriots have lived divided since turkey invaded cyprus 's north in 1974 in response to a brief greek-inspired coup .
decades of international efforts to re-unite the island have failed . political analysts say the latest vote shows international mediators will have a hard time trying to re-impose the un settlement proposals , which had called for large degrees of power-sharing between the two sides . they also say the results have set the stage for a diplomatic stand-off between cyprus and turkey in brussels later this year . threate n i n g to veto turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike greek cypriots , turkish cypriots have backed unification of the island cyprus , represented in the eu only by its internationally recognized greek cypriot government , does not have any diplomatic ties with ankara , which is keen to join the european bloc . papadopoulos has warned that cyprus could veto turkey 's bid to join the eu if ankara does n't comply with european commitments to open its ports and airports to cypriot traffic by the end of this year . but turkey insists that cypriot access to its harbors will remain restricted until the greek cypriot government ends the political isolation of the island 's turkish north . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's reform efforts wane turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .

us tv companies are hoping that millions more will in the country where football is played with the hands and the biggest world championship is a baseball event , world cup fever is gradually taking hold - at least that 's what us broadcasters are hoping . television and radio networks across the us are expecting such a demand for the soccer showcase that all 64 games of the 2006 world cup in germany will be broadcast live across the country , where soccer is gaining currency as a viewing spectacle amid a large hispanic following . while the world 's most popular sport remains a minority interest in the us market compared with commercial juggernauts like american football , buying up world cup television rights in the states is becoming an increasingly expensive proposition . for the national abc network and espn sports network - both owned by the walt disney company - the coming tournament in germany will mark their fourth straight shared broadcast of a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans in the us will be spolied for choice for the first time , the games will be televised in high definition and abc will broadcast 12 matches live - a significant change from the 2002 tournament in japan and south korea when the network only showed the final live .
espn will carry 21 matches live , with the remaining 31 games to be shown on espn2 . investment in the future in november , abc and espn announced that they had also secured the us english-language rights for the 2010 and 2014 tournaments as part of a $ 100 million -lrb- 128 million euro -rrb- package - more than twice the price paid for the 2002 and 2006 tournaments . the cost of the us spanish-language rights have shown a similar inflationary trend , with univision forking out over $ 325 million for the next two tournaments , an increase of $ 200 million on the sum it stumped up for the 2002 and 2006 world cups . of the gross us audience of 85 million that watched the 2002 tournament , around 80 million were hispanic .
the overall figure would probably have been higher but for the time difference with asia that meant most matches were played in the middle of the night . foreign language broadcasters find their niche bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koreans like their soccer another notable broadcaster in the us market this time around will be kbs world , a korean-language subscription channel available via satellite or digital cable in some areas . although its audience is tiny compared to the number of hispanic viewers , kbs will show 56 games live and 8 games via short tape delay . for those soccer fans on the move or otherwise away from their television sets , this year 's world cup will , for the first time , be available on satellite radio . xm , the largest us satellite radio service with more than six million subscribers , launched a dedicated world cup soccer channel last month .
the channel will provide english and spanish-language commentary of most games in the competition . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de playing the name game when is football not football ?

11 terrorist attacks are being well-received but the film , which goes on release in august just ahead of the fifth anniversary of the attacks in which nearly 3,000 people died , remains so sensitive that paramount pictures has written to theaters warning them that the trailers are now being screened . as the clip ended in cannes with a shot of nicolas cage 's eyes blinking open in the dark , there was a sharp intake of breath and then applause for stone . paul greengrass ' " united 93 " is also to be shown here , telling the story of a fourth plane bound for washington , which crashed into a field in pennsylvania after a passenger uprising . in march , one new york cinema stopped showing a preview for the film because of the audience 's negative response to it .

they also gave no details on the releases .
" our principle is that the government rejects ransom payments , " reinhard silberberg , the head of the german foreign ministry 's team responsible for such matters told the leipziger volkszeitung .

the overall figure would probably have been higher but for the time difference with asia that meant most matches were played in the middle of the night . foreign language broadcasters find their niche bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koreans like their soccer another notable broadcaster in the us market this time around will be kbs world , a korean-language subscription channel available via satellite or digital cable in some areas . although its audience is tiny compared to the number of hispanic viewers , kbs will show 56 games live and 8 games via short tape delay . for those soccer fans on the move or otherwise away from their television sets , this year 's world cup will , for the first time , be available on satellite radio . xm , the largest us satellite radio service with more than six million subscribers , launched a dedicated world cup soccer channel last month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.05.2006 moonlighting mp rekindles calls for " transparent legislators " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most agree that voters deserve clarity about side jobs of legislators a german lawmaker has been criticized for planning to moonlight as manager of a business lobbying group .
while most feel he should leave parliament , side jobs for parliamentarians in general remain a hot-button issue . norbert röttgen has little time to spare .
during a typical week , the member of germany 's parliament spends about 60 hours representing his constituents - and that 's not counting weekends , when he 's back in his district attending events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert röttgen has so far served as his party 's parliamentary manager but despite his full workload , the 40-year-old christian democrat , who is often described as a " close confidante " of chancellor angela merkel , now plans to take on another job : next january , he 's expected to become general manager of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , which represents the interests of german businesses . as a result , röttgen said he wo n't seek re-election to parliament in 2009 .
but citing a responsibility to the people who elected him , the lawmaker intends to keep his mandate until then . a co n flict of i n terest a n d too much work while many german parliamentarians - unlike us lawmakers , for example - keep working part-time in their professions while in office , a second full-time job remains the exception .
that 's why röttgen 's move has provoked criticism from across the political spectrum and even a former bdi president . " i would have never tolerated this , " said hans-olaf henkel , who headed the organization between 1995 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many seats in germany 's parliament often remain empty as legislators have other obligations röttgen would certainly be an asset for bdi , henkel said .
but his simultaneous role as legislator and lobbyist represents a conflict of interest , he added , citing another parliamentarian who moonlights as general manager of the confederation of german employers ' associations as a bad precedent .
henkel also said that the bdi job was simply too demanding . " you ca n't just run off to parliamentary hearings , " he said , adding that he 's generally in favor of encouraging parliamentarians to work on the side in order to keep them grounded in society . a n eed for tra n spare n cy that 's a view shared by many , including members of the german chapter of corruption watchdog transparency international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament 's not quite as colorful and diverse as the lamps in its cafeteria " we need the know-how of people who have a professional career , " said jochen bäumel , a board member of the organization , adding that the additional income and business interests of lawmakers should be made public to create more transparency for voters . parliamentarians actually approved a new code of conduct last year .
it requires publication of the source and level of extra income .
all legislators had to hand over that information to parliamentary president norbert lammert by the end of march .
but lammert decided to delay publication until germany 's highest court has ruled on a complaint against the plan that was filed by six lawmakers . fuelli n g e n vy ? " publicizing side income can not make transparent any potential conflicts of interest - it only fuels feelings of envy , " said hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party and one of the plaintiffs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing professional and political work is what 's important , according to otto a lawyer and notary , otto said that he spends a quarter to a third of his time working in his old profession , but categorically rejects cases that have anything to do with his work as a parliamentarian . " it makes me more independent and offers me indispensable practical experience , " he said , adding that while he disapproves of secondary full-time jobs such as the one sought by röttgen , he thinks that more of his colleagues should keep working on the side . " we need successful , experienced people here , " said otto , who approves of publishing general information about side jobs , such as the type of work and memberships in supervisory boards .
" but publicizing -lrb- extra income -rrb- will prevent them from coming . " a ba n o n side jobs ? others said that financial interests should not become the decisive factor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to voters to renew legislators ' contracts " a political mandate is n't just about monetary rewards , it 's about being able to make a difference , " said ulrich eith , a political scientist at freiburg university , who rejected the argument that legislators had to keep working in their profession since they had no guarantee of re-election . " if i start a job at a company tomorrow , i also wo n't get any guarantees that i will be able to remain there for the rest of my life , " he said . the publication of extra income was the minimum voters should demand , eith added . " i do n't see why parliamentarians should have side jobs when they are paid appropriately , " he said . the citize n calls the tu n e that 's a sentiment echoed by michael hartmann , a social democratic parliamentarian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for the german people , " reads the text above the parliament 's entrance " i 'm paid by the citizens and they call the tune , " he said , adding that as a former government spokesman in the southwestern state of rhineland-palatinate , he is in a privileged position as he can return to his old job should voters oust him in 2009 . with a work week of 60 to 80 hours , hartmann said he did n't have time to take on other work , but added that he was not generally opposed to legislators taking on part-time jobs on the side as long as they publicized it according to the new code of conduct . " that 's something we have to endure , " he said .

us tv companies are hoping that millions more will in the country where football is played with the hands and the biggest world championship is a baseball event , world cup fever is gradually taking hold - at least that 's what us broadcasters are hoping . television and radio networks across the us are expecting such a demand for the soccer showcase that all 64 games of the 2006 world cup in germany will be broadcast live across the country , where soccer is gaining currency as a viewing spectacle amid a large hispanic following . while the world 's most popular sport remains a minority interest in the us market compared with commercial juggernauts like american football , buying up world cup television rights in the states is becoming an increasingly expensive proposition . for the national abc network and espn sports network - both owned by the walt disney company - the coming tournament in germany will mark their fourth straight shared broadcast of a world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans in the us will be spolied for choice for the first time , the games will be televised in high definition and abc will broadcast 12 matches live - a significant change from the 2002 tournament in japan and south korea when the network only showed the final live .
espn will carry 21 matches live , with the remaining 31 games to be shown on espn2 . investment in the future in november , abc and espn announced that they had also secured the us english-language rights for the 2010 and 2014 tournaments as part of a $ 100 million -lrb- 128 million euro -rrb- package - more than twice the price paid for the 2002 and 2006 tournaments . the cost of the us spanish-language rights have shown a similar inflationary trend , with univision forking out over $ 325 million for the next two tournaments , an increase of $ 200 million on the sum it stumped up for the 2002 and 2006 world cups . of the gross us audience of 85 million that watched the 2002 tournament , around 80 million were hispanic .
the overall figure would probably have been higher but for the time difference with asia that meant most matches were played in the middle of the night . foreign language broadcasters find their niche bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koreans like their soccer another notable broadcaster in the us market this time around will be kbs world , a korean-language subscription channel available via satellite or digital cable in some areas . although its audience is tiny compared to the number of hispanic viewers , kbs will show 56 games live and 8 games via short tape delay . for those soccer fans on the move or otherwise away from their television sets , this year 's world cup will , for the first time , be available on satellite radio . xm , the largest us satellite radio service with more than six million subscribers , launched a dedicated world cup soccer channel last month .

the result is the latest setback to the united nations plan to re-unify the island , and could even undermine turkish efforts to join the european union . half a million greek cypriots took to the polls to elect 56 representatives .
it was their first chance to pick mps since a referendum on reunification was rejected in 2004 .
it was also the first time in decades that some 270 of the ethnic turks living in the greek-held part of cyprus were allowed to vote and contest the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of communistic party akel celebrating their party 's victory results show the governing coalition , which ran on an anti-reunification platform , gained support at the polls .
president tassos papadopoulos ' diko party won 18 percent of the vote - up 3 percent on its last showing - while his allies from the communist akel party won 31 percent .
the pro-reunification opposition party , the disy , lost ground to come a close second with 30 percent of the vote . un proposal doomed ? greek and turkish cypriots have lived divided since turkey invaded cyprus 's north in 1974 in response to a brief greek-inspired coup .
decades of international efforts to re-unite the island have failed . political analysts say the latest vote shows international mediators will have a hard time trying to re-impose the un settlement proposals , which had called for large degrees of power-sharing between the two sides . they also say the results have set the stage for a diplomatic stand-off between cyprus and turkey in brussels later this year . threate n i n g to veto turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike greek cypriots , turkish cypriots have backed unification of the island cyprus , represented in the eu only by its internationally recognized greek cypriot government , does not have any diplomatic ties with ankara , which is keen to join the european bloc . papadopoulos has warned that cyprus could veto turkey 's bid to join the eu if ankara does n't comply with european commitments to open its ports and airports to cypriot traffic by the end of this year . but turkey insists that cypriot access to its harbors will remain restricted until the greek cypriot government ends the political isolation of the island 's turkish north . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's reform efforts wane turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .

and topics like human rights and iran 's status as a nuclear power were also on the agenda . most of all , though , the visit was about two governments getting to know each other .
it was the chancellor 's first visit to china since taking office a half a year ago . the 63 year old wen clearly took to merkel , saying she brought a " friendly wind " to beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles soon made way for hard talking for her part , merkel said germany 's relationship with china was good , but there was room for improvement . after the discussions in beijing , merkel and wen announced that germany and china had agreed that iran should not be allowed to build nuclear weapons .
however , despite the rather obvious and expected consensus , there was no mention of any progress in decreasing the divisions over what action should be taken to enforce it . agreeme n t o n weapo n s but n o co n se n sus o n actio n " we talked about iran and both -lrb- of us -rrb- agreed iran should not have the capability to make nuclear weapons and should n't proliferate weapons of mass destruction , " merkel told a joint press conference with wen . chancellor merkel also chose to bring up the topic of china 's human rights record , an issue that critics in germany have pushed merkel to address and one that her predecessor gerhard schröder was loath to do on his visits to the people 's republic .

she did not go into details on whether she brought up any specific human rights cases but added : " i have made it clear that human rights are indivisible .

and topics like human rights and iran 's status as a nuclear power were also on the agenda . most of all , though , the visit was about two governments getting to know each other .
it was the chancellor 's first visit to china since taking office a half a year ago . the 63 year old wen clearly took to merkel , saying she brought a " friendly wind " to beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles soon made way for hard talking for her part , merkel said germany 's relationship with china was good , but there was room for improvement . after the discussions in beijing , merkel and wen announced that germany and china had agreed that iran should not be allowed to build nuclear weapons .
however , despite the rather obvious and expected consensus , there was no mention of any progress in decreasing the divisions over what action should be taken to enforce it . agreeme n t o n weapo n s but n o co n se n sus o n actio n " we talked about iran and both -lrb- of us -rrb- agreed iran should not have the capability to make nuclear weapons and should n't proliferate weapons of mass destruction , " merkel told a joint press conference with wen . chancellor merkel also chose to bring up the topic of china 's human rights record , an issue that critics in germany have pushed merkel to address and one that her predecessor gerhard schröder was loath to do on his visits to the people 's republic . " it 's an important issue of bilateral dialogue , " merkel told the assembled press after talks at the great hall of the people .
she did not go into details on whether she brought up any specific human rights cases but added : " i have made it clear that human rights are indivisible . " merkel is critical of efforts within the european union to lift the ban on arms sales to beijing without first securing guarantees on human rights reforms in china . pirated goods a n d price dumpi n g co n cer n s addressed trade between germany and china was also on the agenda .
bilateral trade reached 49.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 63.2 billion -rrb- last year , making germany china 's largest trading partner in the european union .
but even so there were still a few hot topics the chancellor chose to bring up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate goods from china cost the global economy billions fake goods and the protection of intellectual property rights is a chronic irritant in trade relations between the two countries and merkel , who was accompanied by a 40-strong delegation of german business leaders and economics minister michael glos , urged the chinese to take stronger measures to curtail a counterfeit industry which cost global business around 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- a year . " because we are technological leaders in many areas , protection of intellectual property is crucial to our success , " merkel told the fourth meeting of the high-technology dialogue forum , attended by over 300 german and chinese business and industry representatives .
" but i observe with great interest the rise in china 's technological capacities , " she said .
" that should give china a higher stake in effectively protecting intellectual property . " premier wen jiabao conceded there are still " many problems " in the area .
" the protection of intellectual property is not only an international duty for us , but it also serves the interests of china , " mr wen said , adding that his government was considering both " administrative " and " judicial " tools to better protect companies ' proprietary information . german industrialists , who have often complained about the lax enforcement of china 's anti-piracy laws , say chinese regulations actually encourage intellectual property theft by forcing german companies to reveal highly detailed proprietary information about their technologies , for instance when bidding for public tenders . an agreement between german and chinese textile industry representatives against product piracy that would punish companies that make counterfeit textiles is expected to be signed during merkel 's visit . the german contingent were also expected to discuss the the eu 's anti-dumping tariffs on clothing and footwear with their chinese counterparts , a contentious issue which has been threatening to spill over into a full-scale trade war . leaders sig n railway deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german technology will be applied to a new generation of trains the two nations did agree on a deal which would see germany 's siemens , china 's ministry of railways and chinese firm csr zhuzhou electric locomotive work together on the building of 500 chinese trains , although no details about the timing or extent of cooperation were given in the agreement or by chinese officials . siemens president and chief executive officer klaus kleinfeld told reporters after the memorandum of understanding was signed that the total value of the project could be worth 1.2 billion euros . in shanghai on tuesday , merkel planned to look at germany 's favorite export object , the transrapid rail line . dw staff -lrb- nda / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a flawed sino-german business connection product piracy is high on the agenda of german chancellor angela merkel 's current trip to china .

the water city scheme hopes to open up derelict waterways from areas like canary wharf to the royal docks and from greenwich to hackney marshes .
the river lea and regent 's canal would also become the main arteries of about 250 hectares of new green space .
the 2012 london olympics will begin the redevelopment but officials want to expand the benefits across the area .
last week the mayor announced plans to redevelop the lower lea valley area , where the olympic village will be sited .
homes and jobs over the next decade , the scheme will bring up to 40,000 new homes and 50,000 jobs to one of the most neglected regions in the uk .
between 30,000 and 40,000 houses , 40 % of them for families , would be built on 173 hectares of what is now industrial wasteland .
there would also be up to nine new primary schools and four more secondary schools .
a new road will connect the five town centres planned in stratford , canning town , west ham , hackney wick and bromley by bow .
most of the 50,000 new jobs in the area would be based in stratford city , a huge new shopping mall and office complex .
andrew mawson , one of the leaders of the water city initiative , said : " our vision is to capture the entrepreneurial energy of east london 's remarkable communities and enable them to co-create water city with the world 's finest architects , designers and economists and , in the process , transform the economic opportunities and life chances of east londoners forever . "
the rt hon tessa jowell mp , secretary of state for culture , media and sport said : " it 's encouraging to see there is active debate about how we can shape the lower lea valley . "

homes and jobs over the next decade , the scheme will bring up to 40,000 new homes and 50,000 jobs to one of the most neglected regions in the uk .
between 30,000 and 40,000 houses , 40 % of them for families , would be built on 173 hectares of what is now industrial wasteland .
there would also be up to nine new primary schools and four more secondary schools .
a new road will connect the five town centres planned in stratford , canning town , west ham , hackney wick and bromley by bow .
most of the 50,000 new jobs in the area would be based in stratford city , a huge new shopping mall and office complex .
andrew mawson , one of the leaders of the water city initiative , said : " our vision is to capture the entrepreneurial energy of east london 's remarkable communities and enable them to co-create water city with the world 's finest architects , designers and economists and , in the process , transform the economic opportunities and life chances of east londoners forever . "
the rt hon tessa jowell mp , secretary of state for culture , media and sport said : " it 's encouraging to see there is active debate about how we can shape the lower lea valley . "

the nhs confederation , which represents nhs bosses , says it wants to dispel the " myth " that fewer beds mean less care .
in a briefing paper , it said technological advancement and better community care meant patients could spend less time in hospital .
doctors said while care was improving , some hospitals had cut beds too much and were compromising care .
we must start judging the nhs by the number of people we make better and keep well gill morgan , nhs confederation state of the nhs the paper acknowledges that bed closures caused " emotions to run high " .
it points out that from 1984 to 2004 , the number of beds fell from 211,617 to 145,218 -lrb- 31 % -rrb- .
in fact , numbers have been falling since the late 1950s - a pattern that has been repeated in countries across europe for a variety of reasons .
advances like key-hole surgery mean procedures such as hernia and gall bladder removals can either be carried out as day surgery or require only a few days in surgery , compared to a week or more a few decades ago .
as well as patients needing less recovery time , the nature of care has changed with more being done in the community , such as advanced gp services and greater provision health professionals , such as physiotherapists .
' faster ' chemotherapy can now be administered at home , ambulance crews are treating people on site rather than bringing them into hospital and the better management of chronic conditions such as diabetes has kept people out of hospital .
doctors do sometimes struggle to get patients into wards paul miller , bma timeline : nhs job cuts gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation , said : " more patients are being treated faster and more effectively than ever before by the nhs .
" the number of actual beds has steadily reduced , yet the amount of care the service is able to deliver has dramatically increased . "
instead , ms morgan said the public should move away from concentrating on bed numbers .
" we need to move away from this fixation with bricks and mortar , " she said .
" the world is changing , patients ' needs are changing and the nhs is adapting to meet those needs .
" it 's not surprising that people believe that more beds mean better patient care - this has been the assumption for many years .

" developments in technology and changes in the way treatment is delivered mean we simply need fewer beds . "
doctors concerned but paul miller , chairman of the british medical association 's consultants committee , said there were still cases where cost pressures had meant too many beds had been lost .

" we may have to spread people around the hospital , but that means that patients who need to be on a surgical ward may end up on another type of ward which does not have the right resources .

roger goss , of the group patient concern , said the nhs confederation 's view was only " half the truth " .

at least two pairs of red kites have built nests in gateshead 's derwent valley after a re-introduction project .
there are now hopes for the birth of the first kite chicks in the region since the reign of george iii .
the birds are protected by law and it is an offence to disturb them on the nest , but it is hoped a public viewpoint will soon be provided .
the northern kites project was set up two years ago , and so far 60 red kites have been re-introduced into the region , but none have nested so far .
keith bowey , the project manager , said : " i am absolutely delighted by this exciting and historic news .
" it is wonderful that kites are nesting at this early stage of the project and that they have chosen to settle close to gateshead .
" it will be a red-letter day if young kites fly from a north east nest this spring , and this fabulous news bodes very well for the future of red kites in the region . "

the bbc 's annual radio budget of £ 450m had severely limited growth in the commercial radio sector , the european media forum -lrb- emf -rrb- report said .
as the two rely mainly on music they have a limited public service role - a factor which strengthens the case for privatisation , it added .
the emf estimated the bbc could raise more than £ 500m through a sell off .
" our argument is that whereas you can put forward a pretty compelling case for a public sector role for radios 4 and 3 - and also radio 5 , it gets a bit thin when you look at radios 1 and 2 - and they could survive quite easily in the private sector , " said the report 's author , economist keith boyfield .
growth limited the report argued that the uk radio sector was suffering from " stunted growth " , and the problem had been intensified by the bbc 's ability to cross promote and cross subsidise across a number of media platforms .
have your say the public benefit from there being radio stations that are not at the mercy of market forces will the boss , northamptonshire send us your comments the emf also argued that radios 1 and 2 would fare well in the commercial sector as the stations currently attract the highest radio audiences in the uk .
" if both radio 1 and 2 were sold in a combined sale the proceeds might arguably total £ 500m or more , " it added .
but the bbc said both radio stations offered diverse music , documentaries and current affairs shows that could not be found in the commercial sector .
it said the stations provided innovative and challenging content that the market would not otherwise provide .
kelvin mackenzie , former chief executive of the wireless group which controls a number of uk local radio stations , welcomed the emf 's privatisation call as a " splendid idea " .
the wide availability of commercial music on radio , the internet and through downloads meant that the two stations could no longer lay claim to offering a public service as set out in the bbc 's remit , he said .
commercial woes " why does the bbc want to hang onto basically what is , on radio one , pop music , and on radio 2 , middle of the road music , when all they 're really doing is bankrupting commercial forces ? , " he told radio 4 's today programme .
commercial radio is currently going through a " nightmare " which is made worse by the fact that the bbc has a 60 % share of the radio audience , mr mackenzie said .
" why should advertisers go to commercial radio when they 're missing 60 % of the audience ? " he added .
the report came as chrysalis - which owns the heart and galaxy brands - blamed a tough advertising market for a sharp 46 % drop in full year profits to £ 2.1m.
earlier this year , radio broadcaster gcap media blamed falling audiences and short advert breaks for a 17 % drop in revenues in the first three months of the year .

have your say " the public benefit from there being radio stations that are not at the mercy of market forces " will the boss , northamptonshire send us your comments the emf also argued that radios 1 and 2 would fare well in the commercial sector as the stations currently attract the highest radio audiences in the uk .
" if both radio 1 and 2 were sold in a combined sale the proceeds might arguably total £ 500m or more , " it added .
but the bbc said both radio stations offered diverse music , documentaries and current affairs shows that could not be found in the commercial sector .
it said the stations provided innovative and challenging content that the market would not otherwise provide .
kelvin mackenzie , former chief executive of the wireless group which controls a number of uk local radio stations , welcomed the emf 's privatisation call as a " splendid idea " .
the wide availability of commercial music on radio , the internet and through downloads meant that the two stations could no longer lay claim to offering a public service as set out in the bbc 's remit , he said .
commercial woes " why does the bbc want to hang onto basically what is , on radio one , pop music , and on radio 2 , middle of the road music , when all they 're really doing is bankrupting commercial forces ? , " he told radio 4 's today programme .
commercial radio is currently going through a " nightmare " which is made worse by the fact that the bbc has a 60 % share of the radio audience , mr mackenzie said .
" why should advertisers go to commercial radio when they 're missing 60 % of the audience ? " he added .
the report came as chrysalis - which owns the heart and galaxy brands - blamed a tough advertising market for a sharp 46 % drop in full year profits to £ 2.1m.
earlier this year , radio broadcaster gcap media blamed falling audiences and short advert breaks for a 17 % drop in revenues in the first three months of the year .

by quentin sommerville bbc news , shanghai china 's economy has been growing at a rate of about10 % a year for at least the past decade , a growth rate that has put it well on track to becoming the world 's richest economy .
the country has moved from relative isolation to become the beating heart of the world economy , with 80 % of the world 's consumer electronics goods now being made there .
the pace and scale of change has caught most people by surprise .
in some of china 's cities , the future seems to have arrived early .
in the past 20 years , shanghai has thrown up skyscrapers , bridges and highways where none existed before .
twenty years of super-fast economic growth have left china transformed .
slower growth but where do we go from here ?
what will china be like in 20 years time ?
the facts behind the changing faces of china and india in shanghai 's urban planning exhibition , they have already mapped out the answer : the entire second floor is given over to a scale model of the city , now - and what it will become .
every building is shown in painstaking detail , and the most breathtaking thing about this permanent exhibition is how quickly so much of it became reality .
but shanghai can not keep growing at this rate forever , and neither can china 's economy .
from highs of around 10 % annual growth , economists believe china will settle down to around 6 % growth a year .
so in 20 years time , things will be moving a bit slower .
but china will still be growing , at rates most developed countries envy .
and that is not all that will be different , according to andy rothman , china strategist for clsa in shanghai .
" the amount of personal freedom has improved dramatically , " he says .
" twenty years ago the government was involved in almost every decision of day-to-day life .
today all of that 's gone .
" in order to have a market based economy , you have to let people be able to do whatever they want to do , and allow the free flow of information . "
pleasure and pressure the expanding middle class is enjoying many of those pleasures .
composer max zhao is one of them . "
we are dirty , they say , they do n't want to touch us " gayatri , indian scavenger india 2025 : what will life be like ?
he , along with 200 million other chinese , are now earning enough money to afford their own cars and apartments .
he is enjoying the benefits of china 's newfound riches , but in the future he says he expects more stress , as well as more freedom .
" our generation is buying cars and houses , but compared with my parents ' generation , we 've got much more pressure , " he says .
" the whole society is developing , others have got money , car and house , which forces you to make money all the time .
" development has both a good side and a bad side . "
the communist government faces a difficult balancing act as it tries to manage the growing demand for greater freedom from chinas new army of consumers .
as they look to the future , those consumers can be virtually certain that their country will become the world 's largest economy within their lifetime .
this generation of chinese people have come a long way in a short space of time , but it is a journey that is only just beginning .

every building is shown in painstaking detail , and the most breathtaking thing about this permanent exhibition is how quickly so much of it became reality .
but shanghai can not keep growing at this rate forever , and neither can china 's economy .
from highs of around 10 % annual growth , economists believe china will settle down to around 6 % growth a year .

he , along with 200 million other chinese , are now earning enough money to afford their own cars and apartments .
