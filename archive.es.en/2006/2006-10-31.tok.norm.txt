but sinti and roma groups say borat is racist and are asking german courts to intervene . german fans of british comedian sacha baron cohen , better known to many as ali g , have been eagerly awaiting the nov .
2 release of his new film borat : cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan . the " mockumentary " featuring a bigoted , fictional reporter from kazakhstan travelling around the united states satirizes the often shocking prejudices of ordinary americans .
but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .
but there have been no announcements about plans to change the film before it opens in german cinemas . " will it harm the car ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat arrived in london on wednesday for the film 's uk premier the controversy centers on how one interprets the borat figure , a provincial journalist in a bad moustache and cheap suit , who spouts anti-semitic , racist and sexist prejudices in comically broken english .
for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .
they 're never given a chance to speak for themselves . " kazakhstan not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat also stirred up trouble at the 2005 mtv europe music awards this is n't the first time the borat figure has gotten cohen in trouble .
officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .
defense minister franz josef jung also talked this week of withdrawing troops from bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan meet with defense minister jung germany 's president , horst köhler , has called for more prudence when it comes to committing troops to hotspots abroad , although he added in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr that as a medium-sized power , germany was obliged to contribute to some foreign missions . but , he said , the missions must be carefully thought out and planned taking german foreign , development and security policy into consideration . in this area , he said , there are still things to be done . other high-ranking officials involved in defense matters had similar sentiments , including the former commander of the international peacekeeping force in kosovo , general klaus reinhardt , who worried that german peacekeepers were simply being thrown into a country with little thought given to long-term stabilization and exit strategies . " policy makers have n't yet devised a strategy that goes beyond the fact that one wants to intervene in a country , " he told the financial times deutschland .
" there is no strategy for the balkans , none for afghanistan . " overstretched ? there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some troops from bosnia are likely to come home " in some areas , we have already hit the limit , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung . on sunday , he announced that germany would begin as early as sunday to withdraw troops from bosnia and herzegovina , where troops have been involved in stabilizing the country that was ravaged by war from 1992 to 1995 . after a recent scandal involving soldiers in afghanistan posing for photographs with a skull , others say german soldiers might not be getting sufficient training to understand the cultural sensitivities they might encounter abroad . " it is a question of the capability and skill of the troops , " said michael berndsen , a defense ministry spokesman . doubts in parliament while jung said there is still wide support for foreign missions in the german parliament , which must approve them , some parliamentarians are now of the opinion that the limit has been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung " therefore we must exercise restraint regarding foreign deployments , " he said , adding that any further commitment must be carefully explained and its goals clearly laid out . after the afghanistan photo scandal , a survey by the forsa polling institute found that 46 percent of germans thought germany should reduce its foreign commitments while 50 percent thought there was no need to change the current levels .
four percent had not opinion on the subject . however , there were some calls for the bundeswehr to expand operations abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if german peacekeeping troops are being adequately prepared the chair of the defense committee of the german parliament , ulrike merten , told german public radio that the military was not overburdened and a study has shown that up to 14,000 troops could be sent overseas .
she said it was " unfortunate " to link a possible pull-out from bosnia with other missions in other parts of the globe . the green party would like to see more german troops head abroad , perhaps as many as 16,000 . " we have to prepare the german public for the fact that we 'll probably get more requests -lrb- for soldiers -rrb- in the future than fewer , " said kerstin müller , the party 's foreign policy spokesman in the parliament . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers admit to taking horrific photos the bundeswehr said three of its soldiers have owned up to posing for pictures with human skulls in afghanistan , but questions remain as to what the military knew about the scandal and when .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- chancellor unleashes new defense spending debate in recent years , germany 's army has changed drastically and some say should change more .
created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2006 opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan . in the 17 years since the collapse of the soviet union , german-polish relations have seldom been as bad as they are now .
it 's a point not just stated by the media in the two countries , but also publicly by german and polish politicians . from the polish perspective , the reasons behind the deteriorating relationship are easy to list - the baltic sea pipeline , which is supposed to transport gas from russia to germany but by carefully skirting poland and the recent clamor by german expellees . complaints on both sides the german list of complaints against warsaw is a bit longer .
ever since kaczynski 's party started dictating the pace of german-polish relations , there have been problems . the most serious difficulty is the general political atmosphere on the vistula , which serves as a breeding ground for perpetuating various anti-german prejudices .
it is not even considered reprehensible to politically stigmatize your political opponent by accusing him of being of german descent . warsaw 's destructive attitudes toward financing the german-polish youth organization , the halting of work on many committees -lrb- like the one responsible for boat traffic on the oder river -rrb- , and cultural exchange are all on the german list of negatives . berlin 's most frequent criticism is that the polish side does n't operate cooperatively , blocks germany 's propositions and is not interested in constructively working together .
not great prospects for germany 's upcoming eu presidency . visit alone is a sign of progress considering the long list of accusations from both sides , it is not surprising that the fact that prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski did actually manage to visit berlin at all is considered a success unto itself . but that 's not all . the visit did bring about a thaw in frosty relations in some areas .
the money the polish government owned the german-polish youth organization has already come in , for example .
as is often the case at such events , both sides praised the youth organization 's success - which still does n't make it immune to future blows . there are signs that the controversial pipeline issue may be resolved . russia wo n't turn off the taps , thus ensuring that poland wo n't be cut off from gas supplies from moscow .
a european energy market is to be established to provide energy security to all eu members , including poland . both sides can be pleased jaroslaw kaczynski can return to warsaw satisfied .
the charm offensive he 's begun will at least keep poland out of the german headlines for a while . and angela merkel can exhale a sigh of relief because the poles are going to start acting a bit more constructively instead of boycotting germany 's eu presidency . hubert wohlan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? -lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- polish prime minister meets german chancellor during his first official visit to germany , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski addressed a number of issues in berlin on monday which he said were continuing to raise concerns back home .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- germany hopes for better ties as polish premier visits berlin following a series of controversies that cloud german-polish relations , poland 's premier visits berlin monday .
relations at the top level remain icy , but young poles seem to have a more positive view of their neighbors .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- feedback how did the polish prime minister 's visit to berlin improve german-polish relations in your opinion ?

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara . " this is a critical report , the pace of reforms has slowed , " a european source said on tuesday , stressing at the same time that ankara has made progress in some areas . commission officials were refusing to comment on the report 's contents until it is issued on nov .

" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara . " this is a critical report , the pace of reforms has slowed , " a european source said on tuesday , stressing at the same time that ankara has made progress in some areas . commission officials were refusing to comment on the report 's contents until it is issued on nov .

" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .

" our colleagues had to defend themselves with batons and pepper spray . " in other clashes , police used pepper spray and arrested 21 people at a second-division match between southern german sides augsburg and 1860 munich .
in addition , 70 amateur and youth matches in siegen-wittgenstein region were called off after referees , fearing for their safety , refused to take the field . ignorance and arrogance bildunterschrift : zwanziger says he 's very concerned about violence in the lower divisions dynamo dresden 's business director blamed an over-reaction by stadium security officials for escalating the violence in berlin - an accusation berlin police president dieter glietsch vigorously rejected . " the interpretation of dynamo officials demonstrates ignorance and arrogance , " glietsch told die welt . "
it only serves to encourage hooliganism , when , as is the case here , team leaders turn hooligans into the victims and the police officials who were attacked into the victims . " the dfb is currently investigating dyanamo dresden 's role in that incident .
zwanziger has also threatened disciplinary measures , if there is a repeat of last weekend 's mayhem at dresden 's match against union berlin on saturday .

" what happened last weekend is regrettable but not new , " zis director michael endler told the financial times deutschland .
" the statistics we have about incidents of this sort show that the situation has existed for five or six years . " while violence may be declining in german soccer 's upper divisions , there are signs it 's on the rise in the lower ranks , and some politicians have said clubs need to do more . " this is n't the police 's job , " said peter trapp , the police expert for the christian democrats in berlin .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .
defense minister franz josef jung also talked this week of withdrawing troops from bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan meet with defense minister jung germany 's president , horst köhler , has called for more prudence when it comes to committing troops to hotspots abroad , although he added in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr that as a medium-sized power , germany was obliged to contribute to some foreign missions . but , he said , the missions must be carefully thought out and planned taking german foreign , development and security policy into consideration . in this area , he said , there are still things to be done . other high-ranking officials involved in defense matters had similar sentiments , including the former commander of the international peacekeeping force in kosovo , general klaus reinhardt , who worried that german peacekeepers were simply being thrown into a country with little thought given to long-term stabilization and exit strategies . " policy makers have n't yet devised a strategy that goes beyond the fact that one wants to intervene in a country , " he told the financial times deutschland .
" there is no strategy for the balkans , none for afghanistan . " overstretched ? there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some troops from bosnia are likely to come home " in some areas , we have already hit the limit , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung . on sunday , he announced that germany would begin as early as sunday to withdraw troops from bosnia and herzegovina , where troops have been involved in stabilizing the country that was ravaged by war from 1992 to 1995 . after a recent scandal involving soldiers in afghanistan posing for photographs with a skull , others say german soldiers might not be getting sufficient training to understand the cultural sensitivities they might encounter abroad . " it is a question of the capability and skill of the troops , " said michael berndsen , a defense ministry spokesman . doubts in parliament while jung said there is still wide support for foreign missions in the german parliament , which must approve them , some parliamentarians are now of the opinion that the limit has been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung " therefore we must exercise restraint regarding foreign deployments , " he said , adding that any further commitment must be carefully explained and its goals clearly laid out . after the afghanistan photo scandal , a survey by the forsa polling institute found that 46 percent of germans thought germany should reduce its foreign commitments while 50 percent thought there was no need to change the current levels .
four percent had not opinion on the subject . however , there were some calls for the bundeswehr to expand operations abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if german peacekeeping troops are being adequately prepared the chair of the defense committee of the german parliament , ulrike merten , told german public radio that the military was not overburdened and a study has shown that up to 14,000 troops could be sent overseas .
she said it was " unfortunate " to link a possible pull-out from bosnia with other missions in other parts of the globe . the green party would like to see more german troops head abroad , perhaps as many as 16,000 . " we have to prepare the german public for the fact that we 'll probably get more requests -lrb- for soldiers -rrb- in the future than fewer , " said kerstin müller , the party 's foreign policy spokesman in the parliament . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers admit to taking horrific photos the bundeswehr said three of its soldiers have owned up to posing for pictures with human skulls in afghanistan , but questions remain as to what the military knew about the scandal and when .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- chancellor unleashes new defense spending debate in recent years , germany 's army has changed drastically and some say should change more .
created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion .
-lrb- 07.09.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .

the two-day conference will look at ways to reverse the europe-wide trend of a falling birth rate and a graying population that experts fear might have a devastating effect on the continent 's economy as well as social structure . governments in the european union must set up more flexible working conditions , such as cuts in working hours when parents are caring for younger children , to be made up at a later stage in life , vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment commissioner told reporters on monday . " staying at home and taking care of the kids should not mean losing out in a career , " said spidla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates are plummeting across most of europe eu member states need to draw up policies that would enable women to balance their work with having the number of children they want , spidla added . most europeans would actually like to have at two children . " fathers who stay at home are not wimps .
and working mothers are not rabenmutter , -lrb- a derogatory german term for women who are not stay-at-home mums -rrb- , " said spidla . sinking birth rates the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . the birthrate in germany , at 1.36 per woman , is slightly below the european union average . " in the future , we will have to look at all policies through demographic glasses , " said spidla .
" changes will be evident in the labor market , the health care and pension system , but demographic ageing will also be a challenge for our educational systems , our urban planning , housing facilities or infrastructure . " spidla welcomed germany 's plans for setting up a " european alliance for families " aimed at supporting family friendly work policies in eu member states .
germany takes over the rotating eu presidency from finland in january . the eu , however , would not plan any concrete legal proposals to tackle the lack of a good balance between work and family life but leave mapping out new policies to the bloc 's member states . policy tools to battle trend " family-friendliness is also a major location factor for european enterprises engaged in global competition , " said german minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen , adding that a balance between work and family life would also increase productivity . von der leyen , a mother of seven , also presented new german initiatives such as the introduction of a salary for parents , which will amount to a maximum of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,284 -rrb- per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : policies that enable fathers to take a more active parenting role finnish minister for social affairs , tuula haatainen called for " universal childcare services " to help in particular women better unite career and family life . the eu commission earlier this month presented a new strategy to address demographic change in the 25-member union .
the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- is expected to shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , taking into account 1.8 million immigrants annually . falling birth rates , rising life expectancy and the retirement of the baby-boomer generation mean that by 2050 , two workers will be paying for one pensioner . in almost all european countries , having a child pushed down the employment rate of women between 20-49 years by more than 14 percent , while it drove up men 's by almost 6 percent , the commission said earlier . the continuing struggle to balance work and home not only forces women to quit their job , but also lowers fertility rates , the eu executive said , adding that this had a negative impact on the bloc 's already sluggish economy . national action plans drawn up by member states so far ' showed less visibility and a loss of momentum of gender issues , ' according to the commission . dw staff / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : men in germany are scared to start families low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german army fights to recover from skull scandal pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal more photos surface in widening german skull scandal six germans questioned in skull scandal peacekeeping -pipe- 31.10.2006 germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many should be committed to missions abroad ?
german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .
defense minister franz josef jung also talked this week of withdrawing troops from bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan meet with defense minister jung germany 's president , horst köhler , has called for more prudence when it comes to committing troops to hotspots abroad , although he added in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr that as a medium-sized power , germany was obliged to contribute to some foreign missions . but , he said , the missions must be carefully thought out and planned taking german foreign , development and security policy into consideration . in this area , he said , there are still things to be done . other high-ranking officials involved in defense matters had similar sentiments , including the former commander of the international peacekeeping force in kosovo , general klaus reinhardt , who worried that german peacekeepers were simply being thrown into a country with little thought given to long-term stabilization and exit strategies . " policy makers have n't yet devised a strategy that goes beyond the fact that one wants to intervene in a country , " he told the financial times deutschland .
" there is no strategy for the balkans , none for afghanistan . " overstretched ? there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some troops from bosnia are likely to come home " in some areas , we have already hit the limit , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung . on sunday , he announced that germany would begin as early as sunday to withdraw troops from bosnia and herzegovina , where troops have been involved in stabilizing the country that was ravaged by war from 1992 to 1995 . after a recent scandal involving soldiers in afghanistan posing for photographs with a skull , others say german soldiers might not be getting sufficient training to understand the cultural sensitivities they might encounter abroad . " it is a question of the capability and skill of the troops , " said michael berndsen , a defense ministry spokesman . doubts in parliament while jung said there is still wide support for foreign missions in the german parliament , which must approve them , some parliamentarians are now of the opinion that the limit has been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung " therefore we must exercise restraint regarding foreign deployments , " he said , adding that any further commitment must be carefully explained and its goals clearly laid out . after the afghanistan photo scandal , a survey by the forsa polling institute found that 46 percent of germans thought germany should reduce its foreign commitments while 50 percent thought there was no need to change the current levels .
four percent had not opinion on the subject . however , there were some calls for the bundeswehr to expand operations abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if german peacekeeping troops are being adequately prepared the chair of the defense committee of the german parliament , ulrike merten , told german public radio that the military was not overburdened and a study has shown that up to 14,000 troops could be sent overseas .
she said it was " unfortunate " to link a possible pull-out from bosnia with other missions in other parts of the globe . the green party would like to see more german troops head abroad , perhaps as many as 16,000 . " we have to prepare the german public for the fact that we 'll probably get more requests -lrb- for soldiers -rrb- in the future than fewer , " said kerstin müller , the party 's foreign policy spokesman in the parliament . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers admit to taking horrific photos the bundeswehr said three of its soldiers have owned up to posing for pictures with human skulls in afghanistan , but questions remain as to what the military knew about the scandal and when .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- chancellor unleashes new defense spending debate in recent years , germany 's army has changed drastically and some say should change more .
created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion .
-lrb- 07.09.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .

" those responsible have made a full confession , " general christof munzlinger , commander of the bundeswehr 's 18th armored brigade , told the daily lübecker nachrichten newspaper on tuesday .
" they expressed their regret and contrition about the incident . " munzlinger declined to give any details about the identity of the three soldiers other than to say that there was no evidence to support initial suspicions that junior officers had been involved . " what is clear is that they failed in their duty , " munzlinger said .
" the bundeswehr 's reputation has suffered massive damage , and the danger posed to our troops in afghanistan is unpardonable . " the photos caused outrage in germany and abroad when they were published earlier in october by a german tabloid and a german tv station .
the bundeswehr is currently investigating a total of 20 active and former soldiers .
two soldiers have been suspended from duty in connection with the affair . bus trips to view human remains ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung is feeling the heat in the skull affair the photos are thought to have been taken in early 2003 , according to a report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper .
afghan workers discovered the human remains , which likely come from the period of either the british or the soviet occupation of afghanistan , while extracting construction materials from a gravel or clay pit . citing a soldier formerly stationed in afghanistan as its source , the newspaper also reported that bus trips were organized for soldiers and visitors from germany to see the bones . opposition politicians are putting increasing pressure on the defense ministry to bring the affair to an end .
on monday , the co-leader of the green party , claudia roth , called upon german defense minister franz-josef jung to travel as quickly as possible to the afghan capital and officially apologize for the photos . parliamentary doubts growing meanwhile , the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle , called in a television interview for mandatory military service to be scrapped in favor of a professional army .
the photos , westerwelle said , showed that the bundeswehr in its current form was out of its depth . an interview , published in the daily newspaper die welt on tuesday , with a former bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan , supported westerwelle 's argument .
the soldier , who preferred to remain anonymous , said he felt that bundeswehr field commanders were often too young and too inexperienced to maintain discipline among troops . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear a german newspaper on saturday published more photographs showing soldiers posing with human skulls and bones in afghanistan as pressure mounted on the government to find the culprits .
-lrb- 28.10.2006 -rrb- skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .

the scandal meanwhile widened as a tabloid said it would publish more photos saturday .

but president mahmoud ahmadinejad said un sanctions wo n't have an impact . six members of germany 's parliamentary committee for disarmament , arms control and non-proliferation met with iranian government leaders in teheran on monday .
the german representatives made an appeal for greater transparency and mutual trust in the conflict over iran 's nuclear program . ute zapf , head of the delegation and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the talks " good and informative , " adding that re-implementing the addendum to the protocol from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would be a step in the right direction . the addendum would allow for unannounced inspections by iaea representatives and the installation of cameras in the nuclear plants . " the good news is that we are looking for open dialogue ; the bad news is that , in my opinion , the positions remain extremely rigid , " said delegation member karl-theodor guttenberg of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . un sanctions possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director said it 's still a possibility that iran is building nuclear weapons germany , great britain and france have drafted a list of proposed economic sanctions being discussed by the un security council .
russia , one of the council 's veto-holding permanent members , has so far called the measures too strict , though some members of the russian parliament said tuesday that the country would have to support the proposed sanctions . " the russian political leadership will apparently have to join a new resolution on iran proposed by britain , germany and france that envisages limited economic sanctions on iran , " yuri volkov , a deputy speaker of the state duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , said in a statement . ahmadinejad said sanctions pointless in a speech on monday in varamin near teheran , ahmadinejad said the proposed un sanctions against his country would have no impact except to " lead to more motivation of the iranian youth . " he did not refer in his speech to last week 's expansion of his country 's uranium enrichment program .
a second 164-machine nuclear centrifuge cascade , used to enrich uranium hexafluoride gas for nuclear fuel , were made operational . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad says iran 's nuclear program is peaceful , but the west is n't convinced iran continues to reject international claims that it is seeking to build atomic weapons and insists on its right to peaceful nuclear technology under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states and european union , however , remain concerned about a possible nuclear program as well as past anti-semitic statements from the iranian leader . " president ahmadinejad is sometimes a bit populist in his speeches to the population .
i think you have to always consider that , " zapf said .
" but if he says something like the holocaust never happened , or that israel should be wiped off the map , of course , we take it seriously and we have to protest against that .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .

this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .
one must grant allowances even if their actions are not understandable .

" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense .

this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone .

but sinti and roma groups say borat is racist and are asking german courts to intervene . german fans of british comedian sacha baron cohen , better known to many as ali g , have been eagerly awaiting the nov .
2 release of his new film borat : cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan . the " mockumentary " featuring a bigoted , fictional reporter from kazakhstan travelling around the united states satirizes the often shocking prejudices of ordinary americans .
but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .
but there have been no announcements about plans to change the film before it opens in german cinemas . " will it harm the car ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat arrived in london on wednesday for the film 's uk premier the controversy centers on how one interprets the borat figure , a provincial journalist in a bad moustache and cheap suit , who spouts anti-semitic , racist and sexist prejudices in comically broken english .
for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .
they 're never given a chance to speak for themselves . " kazakhstan not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat also stirred up trouble at the 2005 mtv europe music awards this is n't the first time the borat figure has gotten cohen in trouble .
officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .
but if borat opens as planned on thursday in germany , there 'll be lots of laughter among fans - and lots of aggravation among groups that feel they 're being exploited as easy targets . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new comic tests germans ' ability to laugh at hitler the third reich has always provided rich comedic possibilities for other countries looking to poke fun at the germans .

in addition to the task force , the dfb will name a full-time security official to coordinate the group 's various efforts to prevent violence . after the meeting , zwanziger said the task force would adopt a two-pronged approach .
" on the one hand , " he said , " we 'll make full use of our legal options and hand out tough punishments .
on the other hand , we 'll work to educate people and create the necessary awareness though better training of our employees and intensive preventative measures - for example , in conjunction with fan projects and fan groups . " last weekend 's violence underscored the need for action .
in the worst incident , 23 policeman were hurt after fans of third-division dynamo dresden tried to storm the field at an away match against hertha berlin 's amateurs .
a total of 22 people were taken into custody in the conflict . " security officials were pelted with gas cartridges and plastic seats , " a spokesman for the berlin police told die welt newspaper on monday .
" our colleagues had to defend themselves with batons and pepper spray . " in other clashes , police used pepper spray and arrested 21 people at a second-division match between southern german sides augsburg and 1860 munich .

it only serves to encourage hooliganism , when , as is the case here , team leaders turn hooligans into the victims and the police officials who were attacked into the victims . " the dfb is currently investigating dyanamo dresden 's role in that incident .
zwanziger has also threatened disciplinary measures , if there is a repeat of last weekend 's mayhem at dresden 's match against union berlin on saturday .

" the statistics we have about incidents of this sort show that the situation has existed for five or six years . " while violence may be declining in german soccer 's upper divisions , there are signs it 's on the rise in the lower ranks , and some politicians have said clubs need to do more .

" our colleagues had to defend themselves with batons and pepper spray . " in other clashes , police used pepper spray and arrested 21 people at a second-division match between southern german sides augsburg and 1860 munich .

it only serves to encourage hooliganism , when , as is the case here , team leaders turn hooligans into the victims and the police officials who were attacked into the victims . " the dfb is currently investigating dyanamo dresden 's role in that incident .
zwanziger has also threatened disciplinary measures , if there is a repeat of last weekend 's mayhem at dresden 's match against union berlin on saturday .

" what happened last weekend is regrettable but not new , " zis director michael endler told the financial times deutschland .
" the statistics we have about incidents of this sort show that the situation has existed for five or six years . " while violence may be declining in german soccer 's upper divisions , there are signs it 's on the rise in the lower ranks , and some politicians have said clubs need to do more . " this is n't the police 's job , " said peter trapp , the police expert for the christian democrats in berlin .

a special task force will now deal with violence and racism in german stadiums . the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , and bundesliga president werner hackmann called the summit after scores of arrests and 23 injured policeman at lower-division matches over the weekend .
in addition to the task force , the dfb will name a full-time security official to coordinate the group 's various efforts to prevent violence . after the meeting , zwanziger said the task force would adopt a two-pronged approach .
" on the one hand , " he said , " we 'll make full use of our legal options and hand out tough punishments .
on the other hand , we 'll work to educate people and create the necessary awareness though better training of our employees and intensive preventative measures - for example , in conjunction with fan projects and fan groups . " last weekend 's violence underscored the need for action .
in the worst incident , 23 policeman were hurt after fans of third-division dynamo dresden tried to storm the field at an away match against hertha berlin 's amateurs .
a total of 22 people were taken into custody in the conflict . " security officials were pelted with gas cartridges and plastic seats , " a spokesman for the berlin police told die welt newspaper on monday .
" our colleagues had to defend themselves with batons and pepper spray . " in other clashes , police used pepper spray and arrested 21 people at a second-division match between southern german sides augsburg and 1860 munich .
in addition , 70 amateur and youth matches in siegen-wittgenstein region were called off after referees , fearing for their safety , refused to take the field . ignorance and arrogance bildunterschrift : zwanziger says he 's very concerned about violence in the lower divisions dynamo dresden 's business director blamed an over-reaction by stadium security officials for escalating the violence in berlin - an accusation berlin police president dieter glietsch vigorously rejected . " the interpretation of dynamo officials demonstrates ignorance and arrogance , " glietsch told die welt . "
it only serves to encourage hooliganism , when , as is the case here , team leaders turn hooligans into the victims and the police officials who were attacked into the victims . " the dfb is currently investigating dyanamo dresden 's role in that incident .
zwanziger has also threatened disciplinary measures , if there is a repeat of last weekend 's mayhem at dresden 's match against union berlin on saturday . " points that arise by the use of violence are not the sort of points we want to hand out in german soccer , " zwanziger said in a television interview . not the police 's job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 22 dynamo dresden fans were detained over the weekend according to the central information office for sports security deployments -lrb- zis -rrb- in düsseldorf , the incidents in berlin and augsburg are less the exception than the norm . " what happened last weekend is regrettable but not new , " zis director michael endler told the financial times deutschland .
" the statistics we have about incidents of this sort show that the situation has existed for five or six years . " while violence may be declining in german soccer 's upper divisions , there are signs it 's on the rise in the lower ranks , and some politicians have said clubs need to do more . " this is n't the police 's job , " said peter trapp , the police expert for the christian democrats in berlin . " the clubs have to make use of their rights as owners or occupiers of stadium premises and provide security services .

but president mahmoud ahmadinejad said un sanctions wo n't have an impact . six members of germany 's parliamentary committee for disarmament , arms control and non-proliferation met with iranian government leaders in teheran on monday .
the german representatives made an appeal for greater transparency and mutual trust in the conflict over iran 's nuclear program . ute zapf , head of the delegation and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the talks " good and informative , " adding that re-implementing the addendum to the protocol from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would be a step in the right direction . the addendum would allow for unannounced inspections by iaea representatives and the installation of cameras in the nuclear plants . " the good news is that we are looking for open dialogue ; the bad news is that , in my opinion , the positions remain extremely rigid , " said delegation member karl-theodor guttenberg of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . un sanctions possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director said it 's still a possibility that iran is building nuclear weapons germany , great britain and france have drafted a list of proposed economic sanctions being discussed by the un security council .
russia , one of the council 's veto-holding permanent members , has so far called the measures too strict , though some members of the russian parliament said tuesday that the country would have to support the proposed sanctions . " the russian political leadership will apparently have to join a new resolution on iran proposed by britain , germany and france that envisages limited economic sanctions on iran , " yuri volkov , a deputy speaker of the state duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , said in a statement . ahmadinejad said sanctions pointless in a speech on monday in varamin near teheran , ahmadinejad said the proposed un sanctions against his country would have no impact except to " lead to more motivation of the iranian youth . " he did not refer in his speech to last week 's expansion of his country 's uranium enrichment program .
a second 164-machine nuclear centrifuge cascade , used to enrich uranium hexafluoride gas for nuclear fuel , were made operational . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad says iran 's nuclear program is peaceful , but the west is n't convinced iran continues to reject international claims that it is seeking to build atomic weapons and insists on its right to peaceful nuclear technology under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states and european union , however , remain concerned about a possible nuclear program as well as past anti-semitic statements from the iranian leader . " president ahmadinejad is sometimes a bit populist in his speeches to the population .
i think you have to always consider that , " zapf said .
" but if he says something like the holocaust never happened , or that israel should be wiped off the map , of course , we take it seriously and we have to protest against that . " iran still defiant , iaea concerned ahmadinejad 's supporters make up the majority in tehran 's parliament and in some parliamentary circles there have demands for a withdrawal from the npt in the event of sanctions , arguing that such measures would demonstrate a lack of respect for iran 's rights under the terms of the treaty . the iaea , however , has not excluded the possibility that iran is indeed building nuclear weapons .
mohamed elbaradei , head of the iaea , said in his annual report that his organization was " not in a position to confirm the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear program , which is cause for worry , " reported reuters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .

this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .
one must grant allowances even if their actions are not understandable .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .

" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .

it 's a point not just stated by the media in the two countries , but also publicly by german and polish politicians . from the polish perspective , the reasons behind the deteriorating relationship are easy to list - the baltic sea pipeline , which is supposed to transport gas from russia to germany but by carefully skirting poland and the recent clamor by german expellees . complaints on both sides the german list of complaints against warsaw is a bit longer .
ever since kaczynski 's party started dictating the pace of german-polish relations , there have been problems . the most serious difficulty is the general political atmosphere on the vistula , which serves as a breeding ground for perpetuating various anti-german prejudices .
it is not even considered reprehensible to politically stigmatize your political opponent by accusing him of being of german descent . warsaw 's destructive attitudes toward financing the german-polish youth organization , the halting of work on many committees -lrb- like the one responsible for boat traffic on the oder river -rrb- , and cultural exchange are all on the german list of negatives . berlin 's most frequent criticism is that the polish side does n't operate cooperatively , blocks germany 's propositions and is not interested in constructively working together .
not great prospects for germany 's upcoming eu presidency . visit alone is a sign of progress considering the long list of accusations from both sides , it is not surprising that the fact that prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski did actually manage to visit berlin at all is considered a success unto itself . but that 's not all . the visit did bring about a thaw in frosty relations in some areas .
the money the polish government owned the german-polish youth organization has already come in , for example .
as is often the case at such events , both sides praised the youth organization 's success - which still does n't make it immune to future blows . there are signs that the controversial pipeline issue may be resolved . russia wo n't turn off the taps , thus ensuring that poland wo n't be cut off from gas supplies from moscow .
a european energy market is to be established to provide energy security to all eu members , including poland . both sides can be pleased jaroslaw kaczynski can return to warsaw satisfied .
the charm offensive he 's begun will at least keep poland out of the german headlines for a while . and angela merkel can exhale a sigh of relief because the poles are going to start acting a bit more constructively instead of boycotting germany 's eu presidency . hubert wohlan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? -lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- polish prime minister meets german chancellor during his first official visit to germany , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski addressed a number of issues in berlin on monday which he said were continuing to raise concerns back home .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- germany hopes for better ties as polish premier visits berlin following a series of controversies that cloud german-polish relations , poland 's premier visits berlin monday .
relations at the top level remain icy , but young poles seem to have a more positive view of their neighbors .

he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind .

several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deligöz says head scarves hinder integration deligöz , who was born in turkey but grew up in germany , addressed muslim women living in germany in a newspaper article recently , saying : " wake up to today 's germany .
this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats .

but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .

for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .

officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .

borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .

most said they were n't surprised by the scandal . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .

most said they were n't surprised by the scandal . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .
one must grant allowances even if their actions are not understandable .
soldiers are soldiers but they are also human beings with all their shortcomings . - h.h. fehse compilied by dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reconsiders sending troops on foreign missions senior politicians on sunday said germany should rethink its role in foreign peacekeeping missions as the scandal over soldiers playing with skulls in afghanistan battered the army 's image .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .
defense minister franz josef jung also talked this week of withdrawing troops from bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan meet with defense minister jung germany 's president , horst köhler , has called for more prudence when it comes to committing troops to hotspots abroad , although he added in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr that as a medium-sized power , germany was obliged to contribute to some foreign missions . but , he said , the missions must be carefully thought out and planned taking german foreign , development and security policy into consideration . in this area , he said , there are still things to be done . other high-ranking officials involved in defense matters had similar sentiments , including the former commander of the international peacekeeping force in kosovo , general klaus reinhardt , who worried that german peacekeepers were simply being thrown into a country with little thought given to long-term stabilization and exit strategies . " policy makers have n't yet devised a strategy that goes beyond the fact that one wants to intervene in a country , " he told the financial times deutschland .
" there is no strategy for the balkans , none for afghanistan . " overstretched ? there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some troops from bosnia are likely to come home " in some areas , we have already hit the limit , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung . on sunday , he announced that germany would begin as early as sunday to withdraw troops from bosnia and herzegovina , where troops have been involved in stabilizing the country that was ravaged by war from 1992 to 1995 . after a recent scandal involving soldiers in afghanistan posing for photographs with a skull , others say german soldiers might not be getting sufficient training to understand the cultural sensitivities they might encounter abroad . " it is a question of the capability and skill of the troops , " said michael berndsen , a defense ministry spokesman . doubts in parliament while jung said there is still wide support for foreign missions in the german parliament , which must approve them , some parliamentarians are now of the opinion that the limit has been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung " therefore we must exercise restraint regarding foreign deployments , " he said , adding that any further commitment must be carefully explained and its goals clearly laid out . after the afghanistan photo scandal , a survey by the forsa polling institute found that 46 percent of germans thought germany should reduce its foreign commitments while 50 percent thought there was no need to change the current levels .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense .

this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deligöz says head scarves hinder integration deligöz , who was born in turkey but grew up in germany , addressed muslim women living in germany in a newspaper article recently , saying : " wake up to today 's germany .
this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .

for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .

officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .

but sinti and roma groups say borat is racist and are asking german courts to intervene . german fans of british comedian sacha baron cohen , better known to many as ali g , have been eagerly awaiting the nov .
2 release of his new film borat : cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan . the " mockumentary " featuring a bigoted , fictional reporter from kazakhstan travelling around the united states satirizes the often shocking prejudices of ordinary americans .
but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .
but there have been no announcements about plans to change the film before it opens in german cinemas . " will it harm the car ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat arrived in london on wednesday for the film 's uk premier the controversy centers on how one interprets the borat figure , a provincial journalist in a bad moustache and cheap suit , who spouts anti-semitic , racist and sexist prejudices in comically broken english .
for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .
they 're never given a chance to speak for themselves . " kazakhstan not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat also stirred up trouble at the 2005 mtv europe music awards this is n't the first time the borat figure has gotten cohen in trouble .
officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the continuing struggle against soccer violence red card for england fans in stuttgart england fans score a goal for good behavior at world cup " nobody comes from england to cause trouble " hooligan violence rears its head for germany-poland game soccer -pipe- 31.10.2006 soccer heads set up anti-violence task force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan violence broke out earlier this year in a dresden stadium too at a crisis meeting in frankfurt , the two most powerful functionaries in german soccer say enough is enough .
a special task force will now deal with violence and racism in german stadiums . the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , and bundesliga president werner hackmann called the summit after scores of arrests and 23 injured policeman at lower-division matches over the weekend .
in addition to the task force , the dfb will name a full-time security official to coordinate the group 's various efforts to prevent violence . after the meeting , zwanziger said the task force would adopt a two-pronged approach .
" on the one hand , " he said , " we 'll make full use of our legal options and hand out tough punishments .
on the other hand , we 'll work to educate people and create the necessary awareness though better training of our employees and intensive preventative measures - for example , in conjunction with fan projects and fan groups . " last weekend 's violence underscored the need for action .
in the worst incident , 23 policeman were hurt after fans of third-division dynamo dresden tried to storm the field at an away match against hertha berlin 's amateurs .
a total of 22 people were taken into custody in the conflict . " security officials were pelted with gas cartridges and plastic seats , " a spokesman for the berlin police told die welt newspaper on monday .
" our colleagues had to defend themselves with batons and pepper spray . " in other clashes , police used pepper spray and arrested 21 people at a second-division match between southern german sides augsburg and 1860 munich .
in addition , 70 amateur and youth matches in siegen-wittgenstein region were called off after referees , fearing for their safety , refused to take the field . ignorance and arrogance bildunterschrift : zwanziger says he 's very concerned about violence in the lower divisions dynamo dresden 's business director blamed an over-reaction by stadium security officials for escalating the violence in berlin - an accusation berlin police president dieter glietsch vigorously rejected . " the interpretation of dynamo officials demonstrates ignorance and arrogance , " glietsch told die welt . "
it only serves to encourage hooliganism , when , as is the case here , team leaders turn hooligans into the victims and the police officials who were attacked into the victims . " the dfb is currently investigating dyanamo dresden 's role in that incident .
zwanziger has also threatened disciplinary measures , if there is a repeat of last weekend 's mayhem at dresden 's match against union berlin on saturday . " points that arise by the use of violence are not the sort of points we want to hand out in german soccer , " zwanziger said in a television interview . not the police 's job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 22 dynamo dresden fans were detained over the weekend according to the central information office for sports security deployments -lrb- zis -rrb- in düsseldorf , the incidents in berlin and augsburg are less the exception than the norm . " what happened last weekend is regrettable but not new , " zis director michael endler told the financial times deutschland .
" the statistics we have about incidents of this sort show that the situation has existed for five or six years . " while violence may be declining in german soccer 's upper divisions , there are signs it 's on the rise in the lower ranks , and some politicians have said clubs need to do more .

a total of 22 people were taken into custody in the conflict . " security officials were pelted with gas cartridges and plastic seats , " a spokesman for the berlin police told die welt newspaper on monday .
" our colleagues had to defend themselves with batons and pepper spray . " in other clashes , police used pepper spray and arrested 21 people at a second-division match between southern german sides augsburg and 1860 munich .
in addition , 70 amateur and youth matches in siegen-wittgenstein region were called off after referees , fearing for their safety , refused to take the field . ignorance and arrogance bildunterschrift : zwanziger says he 's very concerned about violence in the lower divisions dynamo dresden 's business director blamed an over-reaction by stadium security officials for escalating the violence in berlin - an accusation berlin police president dieter glietsch vigorously rejected .

it only serves to encourage hooliganism , when , as is the case here , team leaders turn hooligans into the victims and the police officials who were attacked into the victims . " the dfb is currently investigating dyanamo dresden 's role in that incident .
zwanziger has also threatened disciplinary measures , if there is a repeat of last weekend 's mayhem at dresden 's match against union berlin on saturday . " points that arise by the use of violence are not the sort of points we want to hand out in german soccer , " zwanziger said in a television interview . not the police 's job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 22 dynamo dresden fans were detained over the weekend according to the central information office for sports security deployments -lrb- zis -rrb- in düsseldorf , the incidents in berlin and augsburg are less the exception than the norm . " what happened last weekend is regrettable but not new , " zis director michael endler told the financial times deutschland .
" the statistics we have about incidents of this sort show that the situation has existed for five or six years . " while violence may be declining in german soccer 's upper divisions , there are signs it 's on the rise in the lower ranks , and some politicians have said clubs need to do more . " this is n't the police 's job , " said peter trapp , the police expert for the christian democrats in berlin .

it 's a point not just stated by the media in the two countries , but also publicly by german and polish politicians . from the polish perspective , the reasons behind the deteriorating relationship are easy to list - the baltic sea pipeline , which is supposed to transport gas from russia to germany but by carefully skirting poland and the recent clamor by german expellees . complaints on both sides the german list of complaints against warsaw is a bit longer .
ever since kaczynski 's party started dictating the pace of german-polish relations , there have been problems . the most serious difficulty is the general political atmosphere on the vistula , which serves as a breeding ground for perpetuating various anti-german prejudices .
it is not even considered reprehensible to politically stigmatize your political opponent by accusing him of being of german descent . warsaw 's destructive attitudes toward financing the german-polish youth organization , the halting of work on many committees -lrb- like the one responsible for boat traffic on the oder river -rrb- , and cultural exchange are all on the german list of negatives . berlin 's most frequent criticism is that the polish side does n't operate cooperatively , blocks germany 's propositions and is not interested in constructively working together .
not great prospects for germany 's upcoming eu presidency . visit alone is a sign of progress considering the long list of accusations from both sides , it is not surprising that the fact that prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski did actually manage to visit berlin at all is considered a success unto itself . but that 's not all . the visit did bring about a thaw in frosty relations in some areas .
the money the polish government owned the german-polish youth organization has already come in , for example .
as is often the case at such events , both sides praised the youth organization 's success - which still does n't make it immune to future blows . there are signs that the controversial pipeline issue may be resolved . russia wo n't turn off the taps , thus ensuring that poland wo n't be cut off from gas supplies from moscow .
a european energy market is to be established to provide energy security to all eu members , including poland . both sides can be pleased jaroslaw kaczynski can return to warsaw satisfied .
the charm offensive he 's begun will at least keep poland out of the german headlines for a while . and angela merkel can exhale a sigh of relief because the poles are going to start acting a bit more constructively instead of boycotting germany 's eu presidency . hubert wohlan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? -lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- polish prime minister meets german chancellor during his first official visit to germany , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski addressed a number of issues in berlin on monday which he said were continuing to raise concerns back home .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara . " this is a critical report , the pace of reforms has slowed , " a european source said on tuesday , stressing at the same time that ankara has made progress in some areas . commission officials were refusing to comment on the report 's contents until it is issued on nov .
8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner , will unveil the new report the finnish eu presidency has invited turkish and cypriot officials to last-minute talks on sunday and monday , hoping to make headway in some of the problem areas . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday expressed backing for the meetings in finland .
" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .
-lrb- 13.10.2006 -rrb- new debate arises over eu signals to turkey two days after german chancellor angela merkel returned from a trip to turkey , eu commission vice president günter verheugen criticized a " dangerous spiral " of negative signals being sent to ankara .

" those responsible have made a full confession , " general christof munzlinger , commander of the bundeswehr 's 18th armored brigade , told the daily lübecker nachrichten newspaper on tuesday .
" they expressed their regret and contrition about the incident . " munzlinger declined to give any details about the identity of the three soldiers other than to say that there was no evidence to support initial suspicions that junior officers had been involved . " what is clear is that they failed in their duty , " munzlinger said .
" the bundeswehr 's reputation has suffered massive damage , and the danger posed to our troops in afghanistan is unpardonable . " the photos caused outrage in germany and abroad when they were published earlier in october by a german tabloid and a german tv station .
the bundeswehr is currently investigating a total of 20 active and former soldiers .
two soldiers have been suspended from duty in connection with the affair . bus trips to view human remains ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung is feeling the heat in the skull affair the photos are thought to have been taken in early 2003 , according to a report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper .
afghan workers discovered the human remains , which likely come from the period of either the british or the soviet occupation of afghanistan , while extracting construction materials from a gravel or clay pit . citing a soldier formerly stationed in afghanistan as its source , the newspaper also reported that bus trips were organized for soldiers and visitors from germany to see the bones . opposition politicians are putting increasing pressure on the defense ministry to bring the affair to an end .
on monday , the co-leader of the green party , claudia roth , called upon german defense minister franz-josef jung to travel as quickly as possible to the afghan capital and officially apologize for the photos . parliamentary doubts growing meanwhile , the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle , called in a television interview for mandatory military service to be scrapped in favor of a professional army .
the photos , westerwelle said , showed that the bundeswehr in its current form was out of its depth . an interview , published in the daily newspaper die welt on tuesday , with a former bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan , supported westerwelle 's argument .
the soldier , who preferred to remain anonymous , said he felt that bundeswehr field commanders were often too young and too inexperienced to maintain discipline among troops . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear a german newspaper on saturday published more photographs showing soldiers posing with human skulls and bones in afghanistan as pressure mounted on the government to find the culprits .

the photos , westerwelle said , showed that the bundeswehr in its current form was out of its depth . an interview , published in the daily newspaper die welt on tuesday , with a former bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan , supported westerwelle 's argument .
the soldier , who preferred to remain anonymous , said he felt that bundeswehr field commanders were often too young and too inexperienced to maintain discipline among troops . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear a german newspaper on saturday published more photographs showing soldiers posing with human skulls and bones in afghanistan as pressure mounted on the government to find the culprits .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara . " this is a critical report , the pace of reforms has slowed , " a european source said on tuesday , stressing at the same time that ankara has made progress in some areas . commission officials were refusing to comment on the report 's contents until it is issued on nov .
8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner , will unveil the new report the finnish eu presidency has invited turkish and cypriot officials to last-minute talks on sunday and monday , hoping to make headway in some of the problem areas . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday expressed backing for the meetings in finland .
" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .
-lrb- 13.10.2006 -rrb- new debate arises over eu signals to turkey two days after german chancellor angela merkel returned from a trip to turkey , eu commission vice president günter verheugen criticized a " dangerous spiral " of negative signals being sent to ankara .
-lrb- 09.10.2006 -rrb- turkey 's reform efforts wane turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story .
-lrb- 08.03.2006 -rrb- surveys should turkey be admitted as a member of the eu ?
yes , as soon as possible .
maybe , but not before 2012 .
maybe , if turkey speeds up reforms .
no , never .

russia , one of the council 's veto-holding permanent members , has so far called the measures too strict , though some members of the russian parliament said tuesday that the country would have to support the proposed sanctions . " the russian political leadership will apparently have to join a new resolution on iran proposed by britain , germany and france that envisages limited economic sanctions on iran , " yuri volkov , a deputy speaker of the state duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , said in a statement . ahmadinejad said sanctions pointless in a speech on monday in varamin near teheran , ahmadinejad said the proposed un sanctions against his country would have no impact except to " lead to more motivation of the iranian youth .

the united states and european union , however , remain concerned about a possible nuclear program as well as past anti-semitic statements from the iranian leader . " president ahmadinejad is sometimes a bit populist in his speeches to the population .
i think you have to always consider that , " zapf said .

" iran still defiant , iaea concerned ahmadinejad 's supporters make up the majority in tehran 's parliament and in some parliamentary circles there have demands for a withdrawal from the npt in the event of sanctions , arguing that such measures would demonstrate a lack of respect for iran 's rights under the terms of the treaty . the iaea , however , has not excluded the possibility that iran is indeed building nuclear weapons .

the german representatives made an appeal for greater transparency and mutual trust in the conflict over iran 's nuclear program . ute zapf , head of the delegation and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the talks " good and informative , " adding that re-implementing the addendum to the protocol from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would be a step in the right direction . the addendum would allow for unannounced inspections by iaea representatives and the installation of cameras in the nuclear plants . " the good news is that we are looking for open dialogue ; the bad news is that , in my opinion , the positions remain extremely rigid , " said delegation member karl-theodor guttenberg of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . un sanctions possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director said it 's still a possibility that iran is building nuclear weapons germany , great britain and france have drafted a list of proposed economic sanctions being discussed by the un security council .
russia , one of the council 's veto-holding permanent members , has so far called the measures too strict , though some members of the russian parliament said tuesday that the country would have to support the proposed sanctions . " the russian political leadership will apparently have to join a new resolution on iran proposed by britain , germany and france that envisages limited economic sanctions on iran , " yuri volkov , a deputy speaker of the state duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , said in a statement . ahmadinejad said sanctions pointless in a speech on monday in varamin near teheran , ahmadinejad said the proposed un sanctions against his country would have no impact except to " lead to more motivation of the iranian youth .

the united states and european union , however , remain concerned about a possible nuclear program as well as past anti-semitic statements from the iranian leader . " president ahmadinejad is sometimes a bit populist in his speeches to the population .
i think you have to always consider that , " zapf said .
" but if he says something like the holocaust never happened , or that israel should be wiped off the map , of course , we take it seriously and we have to protest against that . " iran still defiant , iaea concerned ahmadinejad 's supporters make up the majority in tehran 's parliament and in some parliamentary circles there have demands for a withdrawal from the npt in the event of sanctions , arguing that such measures would demonstrate a lack of respect for iran 's rights under the terms of the treaty . the iaea , however , has not excluded the possibility that iran is indeed building nuclear weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german army fights to recover from skull scandal pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal more photos surface in widening german skull scandal six germans questioned in skull scandal afghanistan -pipe- 31.10.2006 skull photos unfortunate but no real surprise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tabloid bild first published the photos that sparked a huge scandal dw readers this week shared their throughts on the images showing german soldiers posing with human skulls in afghanistan .
most said they were n't surprised by the scandal . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .

a special task force will now deal with violence and racism in german stadiums . the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , and bundesliga president werner hackmann called the summit after scores of arrests and 23 injured policeman at lower-division matches over the weekend .
in addition to the task force , the dfb will name a full-time security official to coordinate the group 's various efforts to prevent violence . after the meeting , zwanziger said the task force would adopt a two-pronged approach .
" on the one hand , " he said , " we 'll make full use of our legal options and hand out tough punishments .
on the other hand , we 'll work to educate people and create the necessary awareness though better training of our employees and intensive preventative measures - for example , in conjunction with fan projects and fan groups . " last weekend 's violence underscored the need for action .
in the worst incident , 23 policeman were hurt after fans of third-division dynamo dresden tried to storm the field at an away match against hertha berlin 's amateurs .
a total of 22 people were taken into custody in the conflict . " security officials were pelted with gas cartridges and plastic seats , " a spokesman for the berlin police told die welt newspaper on monday .
" our colleagues had to defend themselves with batons and pepper spray . " in other clashes , police used pepper spray and arrested 21 people at a second-division match between southern german sides augsburg and 1860 munich .
in addition , 70 amateur and youth matches in siegen-wittgenstein region were called off after referees , fearing for their safety , refused to take the field . ignorance and arrogance bildunterschrift : zwanziger says he 's very concerned about violence in the lower divisions dynamo dresden 's business director blamed an over-reaction by stadium security officials for escalating the violence in berlin - an accusation berlin police president dieter glietsch vigorously rejected . " the interpretation of dynamo officials demonstrates ignorance and arrogance , " glietsch told die welt . "
it only serves to encourage hooliganism , when , as is the case here , team leaders turn hooligans into the victims and the police officials who were attacked into the victims . " the dfb is currently investigating dyanamo dresden 's role in that incident .
zwanziger has also threatened disciplinary measures , if there is a repeat of last weekend 's mayhem at dresden 's match against union berlin on saturday .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deligöz says head scarves hinder integration deligöz , who was born in turkey but grew up in germany , addressed muslim women living in germany in a newspaper article recently , saying : " wake up to today 's germany .
this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .

" those responsible have made a full confession , " general christof munzlinger , commander of the bundeswehr 's 18th armored brigade , told the daily lübecker nachrichten newspaper on tuesday .
" they expressed their regret and contrition about the incident . " munzlinger declined to give any details about the identity of the three soldiers other than to say that there was no evidence to support initial suspicions that junior officers had been involved . " what is clear is that they failed in their duty , " munzlinger said .
" the bundeswehr 's reputation has suffered massive damage , and the danger posed to our troops in afghanistan is unpardonable . " the photos caused outrage in germany and abroad when they were published earlier in october by a german tabloid and a german tv station .
the bundeswehr is currently investigating a total of 20 active and former soldiers .
two soldiers have been suspended from duty in connection with the affair . bus trips to view human remains ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung is feeling the heat in the skull affair the photos are thought to have been taken in early 2003 , according to a report in the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper .
afghan workers discovered the human remains , which likely come from the period of either the british or the soviet occupation of afghanistan , while extracting construction materials from a gravel or clay pit . citing a soldier formerly stationed in afghanistan as its source , the newspaper also reported that bus trips were organized for soldiers and visitors from germany to see the bones . opposition politicians are putting increasing pressure on the defense ministry to bring the affair to an end .
on monday , the co-leader of the green party , claudia roth , called upon german defense minister franz-josef jung to travel as quickly as possible to the afghan capital and officially apologize for the photos . parliamentary doubts growing meanwhile , the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle , called in a television interview for mandatory military service to be scrapped in favor of a professional army .
the photos , westerwelle said , showed that the bundeswehr in its current form was out of its depth . an interview , published in the daily newspaper die welt on tuesday , with a former bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan , supported westerwelle 's argument .
the soldier , who preferred to remain anonymous , said he felt that bundeswehr field commanders were often too young and too inexperienced to maintain discipline among troops . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear a german newspaper on saturday published more photographs showing soldiers posing with human skulls and bones in afghanistan as pressure mounted on the government to find the culprits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german army fights to recover from skull scandal pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal more photos surface in widening german skull scandal six germans questioned in skull scandal afghanistan -pipe- 31.10.2006 skull photos unfortunate but no real surprise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tabloid bild first published the photos that sparked a huge scandal dw readers this week shared their throughts on the images showing german soldiers posing with human skulls in afghanistan .
most said they were n't surprised by the scandal . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .
one must grant allowances even if their actions are not understandable .
soldiers are soldiers but they are also human beings with all their shortcomings . - h.h. fehse compilied by dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reconsiders sending troops on foreign missions senior politicians on sunday said germany should rethink its role in foreign peacekeeping missions as the scandal over soldiers playing with skulls in afghanistan battered the army 's image .
-lrb- 29.10.2006 -rrb- pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear a german newspaper on saturday published more photographs showing soldiers posing with human skulls and bones in afghanistan as pressure mounted on the government to find the culprits .
-lrb- 28.10.2006 -rrb- skull scandal raises questions about army training methods as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods .
-lrb- 27.10.2006 -rrb- more photos surface in widening german skull scandal german defense ministry officials friday suspended two soldiers for their alleged part in the desecration of skulls in afghanistan .
the scandal meanwhile widened as a tabloid said it would publish more photos saturday .
-lrb- 27.10.2006 -rrb- afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal kabul has condemned photos published of german soldiers posing with a skull as being " against islamic values . "
the afghan trade minister said he fears effects similar to those in the wake of the mohammed cartoons .

it 's a point not just stated by the media in the two countries , but also publicly by german and polish politicians . from the polish perspective , the reasons behind the deteriorating relationship are easy to list - the baltic sea pipeline , which is supposed to transport gas from russia to germany but by carefully skirting poland and the recent clamor by german expellees . complaints on both sides the german list of complaints against warsaw is a bit longer .
ever since kaczynski 's party started dictating the pace of german-polish relations , there have been problems . the most serious difficulty is the general political atmosphere on the vistula , which serves as a breeding ground for perpetuating various anti-german prejudices .
it is not even considered reprehensible to politically stigmatize your political opponent by accusing him of being of german descent . warsaw 's destructive attitudes toward financing the german-polish youth organization , the halting of work on many committees -lrb- like the one responsible for boat traffic on the oder river -rrb- , and cultural exchange are all on the german list of negatives . berlin 's most frequent criticism is that the polish side does n't operate cooperatively , blocks germany 's propositions and is not interested in constructively working together .
not great prospects for germany 's upcoming eu presidency . visit alone is a sign of progress considering the long list of accusations from both sides , it is not surprising that the fact that prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski did actually manage to visit berlin at all is considered a success unto itself . but that 's not all . the visit did bring about a thaw in frosty relations in some areas .
the money the polish government owned the german-polish youth organization has already come in , for example .
as is often the case at such events , both sides praised the youth organization 's success - which still does n't make it immune to future blows . there are signs that the controversial pipeline issue may be resolved . russia wo n't turn off the taps , thus ensuring that poland wo n't be cut off from gas supplies from moscow .
a european energy market is to be established to provide energy security to all eu members , including poland . both sides can be pleased jaroslaw kaczynski can return to warsaw satisfied .
the charm offensive he 's begun will at least keep poland out of the german headlines for a while . and angela merkel can exhale a sigh of relief because the poles are going to start acting a bit more constructively instead of boycotting germany 's eu presidency . hubert wohlan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2006 opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan . in the 17 years since the collapse of the soviet union , german-polish relations have seldom been as bad as they are now .
it 's a point not just stated by the media in the two countries , but also publicly by german and polish politicians . from the polish perspective , the reasons behind the deteriorating relationship are easy to list - the baltic sea pipeline , which is supposed to transport gas from russia to germany but by carefully skirting poland and the recent clamor by german expellees . complaints on both sides the german list of complaints against warsaw is a bit longer .
ever since kaczynski 's party started dictating the pace of german-polish relations , there have been problems . the most serious difficulty is the general political atmosphere on the vistula , which serves as a breeding ground for perpetuating various anti-german prejudices .
it is not even considered reprehensible to politically stigmatize your political opponent by accusing him of being of german descent . warsaw 's destructive attitudes toward financing the german-polish youth organization , the halting of work on many committees -lrb- like the one responsible for boat traffic on the oder river -rrb- , and cultural exchange are all on the german list of negatives . berlin 's most frequent criticism is that the polish side does n't operate cooperatively , blocks germany 's propositions and is not interested in constructively working together .
not great prospects for germany 's upcoming eu presidency . visit alone is a sign of progress considering the long list of accusations from both sides , it is not surprising that the fact that prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski did actually manage to visit berlin at all is considered a success unto itself . but that 's not all . the visit did bring about a thaw in frosty relations in some areas .
the money the polish government owned the german-polish youth organization has already come in , for example .
as is often the case at such events , both sides praised the youth organization 's success - which still does n't make it immune to future blows . there are signs that the controversial pipeline issue may be resolved . russia wo n't turn off the taps , thus ensuring that poland wo n't be cut off from gas supplies from moscow .
a european energy market is to be established to provide energy security to all eu members , including poland . both sides can be pleased jaroslaw kaczynski can return to warsaw satisfied .
the charm offensive he 's begun will at least keep poland out of the german headlines for a while . and angela merkel can exhale a sigh of relief because the poles are going to start acting a bit more constructively instead of boycotting germany 's eu presidency . hubert wohlan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? -lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- polish prime minister meets german chancellor during his first official visit to germany , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski addressed a number of issues in berlin on monday which he said were continuing to raise concerns back home .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- germany hopes for better ties as polish premier visits berlin following a series of controversies that cloud german-polish relations , poland 's premier visits berlin monday .
relations at the top level remain icy , but young poles seem to have a more positive view of their neighbors .

but the bloc is making closer cooperation dependent on progress regarding the country 's human rights situation and democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev critics of the government say kazakh leader nursultan nazarbayev has all but eliminated the opposition , cracked down on press freedom and done little to fight corruption and red tape . a meeting with nazarbayev , who since 1991 has enjoyed absolute power , is not expected , although it was announced that nazarbayev would visit berlin at the end of 2007 . osce chair so far , steinmeier has met with kazakhstan 's prime minister danial akhmetov and foreign minister kasymzhomart tokayev as well as representatives of the estimated 230,000 to 360,000 ethnic germans living in the country . topics for the talks included kazakhstan 's candidacy for the chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- in 2009 .
the united states and britain have asked the country to delay its chair until 2011 , which tokayev has refused .
berlin is making its support contingent on political reforms . steinmeier has said he would support kazakhstan 's acceptance into the world trade organization , the negotiations for which are in their final phase and should be decided in early 2007 .

but sinti and roma groups say borat is racist and are asking german courts to intervene . german fans of british comedian sacha baron cohen , better known to many as ali g , have been eagerly awaiting the nov .
2 release of his new film borat : cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan . the " mockumentary " featuring a bigoted , fictional reporter from kazakhstan travelling around the united states satirizes the often shocking prejudices of ordinary americans .
but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .
but there have been no announcements about plans to change the film before it opens in german cinemas . " will it harm the car ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat arrived in london on wednesday for the film 's uk premier the controversy centers on how one interprets the borat figure , a provincial journalist in a bad moustache and cheap suit , who spouts anti-semitic , racist and sexist prejudices in comically broken english .
for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .
they 're never given a chance to speak for themselves . " kazakhstan not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat also stirred up trouble at the 2005 mtv europe music awards this is n't the first time the borat figure has gotten cohen in trouble .
officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .

but sinti and roma groups say borat is racist and are asking german courts to intervene . german fans of british comedian sacha baron cohen , better known to many as ali g , have been eagerly awaiting the nov .
2 release of his new film borat : cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan . the " mockumentary " featuring a bigoted , fictional reporter from kazakhstan travelling around the united states satirizes the often shocking prejudices of ordinary americans .
but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .
but there have been no announcements about plans to change the film before it opens in german cinemas . " will it harm the car ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat arrived in london on wednesday for the film 's uk premier the controversy centers on how one interprets the borat figure , a provincial journalist in a bad moustache and cheap suit , who spouts anti-semitic , racist and sexist prejudices in comically broken english .
for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .

officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deligöz says head scarves hinder integration deligöz , who was born in turkey but grew up in germany , addressed muslim women living in germany in a newspaper article recently , saying : " wake up to today 's germany .
this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats .

but president mahmoud ahmadinejad said un sanctions wo n't have an impact . six members of germany 's parliamentary committee for disarmament , arms control and non-proliferation met with iranian government leaders in teheran on monday .
the german representatives made an appeal for greater transparency and mutual trust in the conflict over iran 's nuclear program . ute zapf , head of the delegation and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the talks " good and informative , " adding that re-implementing the addendum to the protocol from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would be a step in the right direction . the addendum would allow for unannounced inspections by iaea representatives and the installation of cameras in the nuclear plants . " the good news is that we are looking for open dialogue ; the bad news is that , in my opinion , the positions remain extremely rigid , " said delegation member karl-theodor guttenberg of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . un sanctions possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director said it 's still a possibility that iran is building nuclear weapons germany , great britain and france have drafted a list of proposed economic sanctions being discussed by the un security council .
russia , one of the council 's veto-holding permanent members , has so far called the measures too strict , though some members of the russian parliament said tuesday that the country would have to support the proposed sanctions . " the russian political leadership will apparently have to join a new resolution on iran proposed by britain , germany and france that envisages limited economic sanctions on iran , " yuri volkov , a deputy speaker of the state duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , said in a statement . ahmadinejad said sanctions pointless in a speech on monday in varamin near teheran , ahmadinejad said the proposed un sanctions against his country would have no impact except to " lead to more motivation of the iranian youth . " he did not refer in his speech to last week 's expansion of his country 's uranium enrichment program .
a second 164-machine nuclear centrifuge cascade , used to enrich uranium hexafluoride gas for nuclear fuel , were made operational . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad says iran 's nuclear program is peaceful , but the west is n't convinced iran continues to reject international claims that it is seeking to build atomic weapons and insists on its right to peaceful nuclear technology under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states and european union , however , remain concerned about a possible nuclear program as well as past anti-semitic statements from the iranian leader . " president ahmadinejad is sometimes a bit populist in his speeches to the population .
i think you have to always consider that , " zapf said .
" but if he says something like the holocaust never happened , or that israel should be wiped off the map , of course , we take it seriously and we have to protest against that . " iran still defiant , iaea concerned ahmadinejad 's supporters make up the majority in tehran 's parliament and in some parliamentary circles there have demands for a withdrawal from the npt in the event of sanctions , arguing that such measures would demonstrate a lack of respect for iran 's rights under the terms of the treaty . the iaea , however , has not excluded the possibility that iran is indeed building nuclear weapons .
mohamed elbaradei , head of the iaea , said in his annual report that his organization was " not in a position to confirm the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear program , which is cause for worry , " reported reuters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

the two-day conference will look at ways to reverse the europe-wide trend of a falling birth rate and a graying population that experts fear might have a devastating effect on the continent 's economy as well as social structure . governments in the european union must set up more flexible working conditions , such as cuts in working hours when parents are caring for younger children , to be made up at a later stage in life , vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment commissioner told reporters on monday . " staying at home and taking care of the kids should not mean losing out in a career , " said spidla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates are plummeting across most of europe eu member states need to draw up policies that would enable women to balance their work with having the number of children they want , spidla added . most europeans would actually like to have at two children . " fathers who stay at home are not wimps .
and working mothers are not rabenmutter , -lrb- a derogatory german term for women who are not stay-at-home mums -rrb- , " said spidla . sinking birth rates the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . the birthrate in germany , at 1.36 per woman , is slightly below the european union average . " in the future , we will have to look at all policies through demographic glasses , " said spidla .
" changes will be evident in the labor market , the health care and pension system , but demographic ageing will also be a challenge for our educational systems , our urban planning , housing facilities or infrastructure . " spidla welcomed germany 's plans for setting up a " european alliance for families " aimed at supporting family friendly work policies in eu member states .
germany takes over the rotating eu presidency from finland in january . the eu , however , would not plan any concrete legal proposals to tackle the lack of a good balance between work and family life but leave mapping out new policies to the bloc 's member states . policy tools to battle trend " family-friendliness is also a major location factor for european enterprises engaged in global competition , " said german minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen , adding that a balance between work and family life would also increase productivity . von der leyen , a mother of seven , also presented new german initiatives such as the introduction of a salary for parents , which will amount to a maximum of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,284 -rrb- per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : policies that enable fathers to take a more active parenting role finnish minister for social affairs , tuula haatainen called for " universal childcare services " to help in particular women better unite career and family life . the eu commission earlier this month presented a new strategy to address demographic change in the 25-member union .
the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- is expected to shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , taking into account 1.8 million immigrants annually . falling birth rates , rising life expectancy and the retirement of the baby-boomer generation mean that by 2050 , two workers will be paying for one pensioner . in almost all european countries , having a child pushed down the employment rate of women between 20-49 years by more than 14 percent , while it drove up men 's by almost 6 percent , the commission said earlier . the continuing struggle to balance work and home not only forces women to quit their job , but also lowers fertility rates , the eu executive said , adding that this had a negative impact on the bloc 's already sluggish economy . national action plans drawn up by member states so far ' showed less visibility and a loss of momentum of gender issues , ' according to the commission . dw staff / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : men in germany are scared to start families low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara . " this is a critical report , the pace of reforms has slowed , " a european source said on tuesday , stressing at the same time that ankara has made progress in some areas . commission officials were refusing to comment on the report 's contents until it is issued on nov .
8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner , will unveil the new report the finnish eu presidency has invited turkish and cypriot officials to last-minute talks on sunday and monday , hoping to make headway in some of the problem areas . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday expressed backing for the meetings in finland .
" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .
-lrb- 13.10.2006 -rrb- new debate arises over eu signals to turkey two days after german chancellor angela merkel returned from a trip to turkey , eu commission vice president günter verheugen criticized a " dangerous spiral " of negative signals being sent to ankara .
-lrb- 09.10.2006 -rrb- turkey 's reform efforts wane turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story .
-lrb- 08.03.2006 -rrb- surveys should turkey be admitted as a member of the eu ?
yes , as soon as possible .
maybe , but not before 2012 .
maybe , if turkey speeds up reforms .
no , never .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara . " this is a critical report , the pace of reforms has slowed , " a european source said on tuesday , stressing at the same time that ankara has made progress in some areas . commission officials were refusing to comment on the report 's contents until it is issued on nov .
8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner , will unveil the new report the finnish eu presidency has invited turkish and cypriot officials to last-minute talks on sunday and monday , hoping to make headway in some of the problem areas . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday expressed backing for the meetings in finland .
" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .

a special task force will now deal with violence and racism in german stadiums . the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , and bundesliga president werner hackmann called the summit after scores of arrests and 23 injured policeman at lower-division matches over the weekend .
in addition to the task force , the dfb will name a full-time security official to coordinate the group 's various efforts to prevent violence . after the meeting , zwanziger said the task force would adopt a two-pronged approach .
" on the one hand , " he said , " we 'll make full use of our legal options and hand out tough punishments .
on the other hand , we 'll work to educate people and create the necessary awareness though better training of our employees and intensive preventative measures - for example , in conjunction with fan projects and fan groups . " last weekend 's violence underscored the need for action .
in the worst incident , 23 policeman were hurt after fans of third-division dynamo dresden tried to storm the field at an away match against hertha berlin 's amateurs .
a total of 22 people were taken into custody in the conflict . " security officials were pelted with gas cartridges and plastic seats , " a spokesman for the berlin police told die welt newspaper on monday .
" our colleagues had to defend themselves with batons and pepper spray . " in other clashes , police used pepper spray and arrested 21 people at a second-division match between southern german sides augsburg and 1860 munich .
in addition , 70 amateur and youth matches in siegen-wittgenstein region were called off after referees , fearing for their safety , refused to take the field . ignorance and arrogance bildunterschrift : zwanziger says he 's very concerned about violence in the lower divisions dynamo dresden 's business director blamed an over-reaction by stadium security officials for escalating the violence in berlin - an accusation berlin police president dieter glietsch vigorously rejected . " the interpretation of dynamo officials demonstrates ignorance and arrogance , " glietsch told die welt . "
it only serves to encourage hooliganism , when , as is the case here , team leaders turn hooligans into the victims and the police officials who were attacked into the victims . " the dfb is currently investigating dyanamo dresden 's role in that incident .
zwanziger has also threatened disciplinary measures , if there is a repeat of last weekend 's mayhem at dresden 's match against union berlin on saturday . " points that arise by the use of violence are not the sort of points we want to hand out in german soccer , " zwanziger said in a television interview . not the police 's job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 22 dynamo dresden fans were detained over the weekend according to the central information office for sports security deployments -lrb- zis -rrb- in düsseldorf , the incidents in berlin and augsburg are less the exception than the norm . " what happened last weekend is regrettable but not new , " zis director michael endler told the financial times deutschland .
" the statistics we have about incidents of this sort show that the situation has existed for five or six years . " while violence may be declining in german soccer 's upper divisions , there are signs it 's on the rise in the lower ranks , and some politicians have said clubs need to do more . " this is n't the police 's job , " said peter trapp , the police expert for the christian democrats in berlin . " the clubs have to make use of their rights as owners or occupiers of stadium premises and provide security services .

most said they were n't surprised by the scandal . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .
one must grant allowances even if their actions are not understandable .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deligöz says head scarves hinder integration deligöz , who was born in turkey but grew up in germany , addressed muslim women living in germany in a newspaper article recently , saying : " wake up to today 's germany .
this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .
defense minister franz josef jung also talked this week of withdrawing troops from bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan meet with defense minister jung germany 's president , horst köhler , has called for more prudence when it comes to committing troops to hotspots abroad , although he added in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr that as a medium-sized power , germany was obliged to contribute to some foreign missions . but , he said , the missions must be carefully thought out and planned taking german foreign , development and security policy into consideration . in this area , he said , there are still things to be done . other high-ranking officials involved in defense matters had similar sentiments , including the former commander of the international peacekeeping force in kosovo , general klaus reinhardt , who worried that german peacekeepers were simply being thrown into a country with little thought given to long-term stabilization and exit strategies . " policy makers have n't yet devised a strategy that goes beyond the fact that one wants to intervene in a country , " he told the financial times deutschland .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara . " this is a critical report , the pace of reforms has slowed , " a european source said on tuesday , stressing at the same time that ankara has made progress in some areas . commission officials were refusing to comment on the report 's contents until it is issued on nov .
8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner , will unveil the new report the finnish eu presidency has invited turkish and cypriot officials to last-minute talks on sunday and monday , hoping to make headway in some of the problem areas . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday expressed backing for the meetings in finland .
" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara . " this is a critical report , the pace of reforms has slowed , " a european source said on tuesday , stressing at the same time that ankara has made progress in some areas . commission officials were refusing to comment on the report 's contents until it is issued on nov .
8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner , will unveil the new report the finnish eu presidency has invited turkish and cypriot officials to last-minute talks on sunday and monday , hoping to make headway in some of the problem areas . turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday expressed backing for the meetings in finland .
" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deligöz says head scarves hinder integration deligöz , who was born in turkey but grew up in germany , addressed muslim women living in germany in a newspaper article recently , saying : " wake up to today 's germany .
this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats .

the two-day conference will look at ways to reverse the europe-wide trend of a falling birth rate and a graying population that experts fear might have a devastating effect on the continent 's economy as well as social structure . governments in the european union must set up more flexible working conditions , such as cuts in working hours when parents are caring for younger children , to be made up at a later stage in life , vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment commissioner told reporters on monday . " staying at home and taking care of the kids should not mean losing out in a career , " said spidla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates are plummeting across most of europe eu member states need to draw up policies that would enable women to balance their work with having the number of children they want , spidla added . most europeans would actually like to have at two children . " fathers who stay at home are not wimps .
and working mothers are not rabenmutter , -lrb- a derogatory german term for women who are not stay-at-home mums -rrb- , " said spidla . sinking birth rates the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . the birthrate in germany , at 1.36 per woman , is slightly below the european union average . " in the future , we will have to look at all policies through demographic glasses , " said spidla .
" changes will be evident in the labor market , the health care and pension system , but demographic ageing will also be a challenge for our educational systems , our urban planning , housing facilities or infrastructure . " spidla welcomed germany 's plans for setting up a " european alliance for families " aimed at supporting family friendly work policies in eu member states .
germany takes over the rotating eu presidency from finland in january . the eu , however , would not plan any concrete legal proposals to tackle the lack of a good balance between work and family life but leave mapping out new policies to the bloc 's member states . policy tools to battle trend " family-friendliness is also a major location factor for european enterprises engaged in global competition , " said german minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen , adding that a balance between work and family life would also increase productivity . von der leyen , a mother of seven , also presented new german initiatives such as the introduction of a salary for parents , which will amount to a maximum of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,284 -rrb- per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : policies that enable fathers to take a more active parenting role finnish minister for social affairs , tuula haatainen called for " universal childcare services " to help in particular women better unite career and family life . the eu commission earlier this month presented a new strategy to address demographic change in the 25-member union .
the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- is expected to shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , taking into account 1.8 million immigrants annually . falling birth rates , rising life expectancy and the retirement of the baby-boomer generation mean that by 2050 , two workers will be paying for one pensioner . in almost all european countries , having a child pushed down the employment rate of women between 20-49 years by more than 14 percent , while it drove up men 's by almost 6 percent , the commission said earlier . the continuing struggle to balance work and home not only forces women to quit their job , but also lowers fertility rates , the eu executive said , adding that this had a negative impact on the bloc 's already sluggish economy . national action plans drawn up by member states so far ' showed less visibility and a loss of momentum of gender issues , ' according to the commission . dw staff / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : men in germany are scared to start families low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .
defense minister franz josef jung also talked this week of withdrawing troops from bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan meet with defense minister jung germany 's president , horst köhler , has called for more prudence when it comes to committing troops to hotspots abroad , although he added in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr that as a medium-sized power , germany was obliged to contribute to some foreign missions . but , he said , the missions must be carefully thought out and planned taking german foreign , development and security policy into consideration . in this area , he said , there are still things to be done . other high-ranking officials involved in defense matters had similar sentiments , including the former commander of the international peacekeeping force in kosovo , general klaus reinhardt , who worried that german peacekeepers were simply being thrown into a country with little thought given to long-term stabilization and exit strategies . " policy makers have n't yet devised a strategy that goes beyond the fact that one wants to intervene in a country , " he told the financial times deutschland .
" there is no strategy for the balkans , none for afghanistan . " overstretched ? there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some troops from bosnia are likely to come home " in some areas , we have already hit the limit , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung . on sunday , he announced that germany would begin as early as sunday to withdraw troops from bosnia and herzegovina , where troops have been involved in stabilizing the country that was ravaged by war from 1992 to 1995 . after a recent scandal involving soldiers in afghanistan posing for photographs with a skull , others say german soldiers might not be getting sufficient training to understand the cultural sensitivities they might encounter abroad . " it is a question of the capability and skill of the troops , " said michael berndsen , a defense ministry spokesman . doubts in parliament while jung said there is still wide support for foreign missions in the german parliament , which must approve them , some parliamentarians are now of the opinion that the limit has been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung " therefore we must exercise restraint regarding foreign deployments , " he said , adding that any further commitment must be carefully explained and its goals clearly laid out . after the afghanistan photo scandal , a survey by the forsa polling institute found that 46 percent of germans thought germany should reduce its foreign commitments while 50 percent thought there was no need to change the current levels .
four percent had not opinion on the subject . however , there were some calls for the bundeswehr to expand operations abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if german peacekeeping troops are being adequately prepared the chair of the defense committee of the german parliament , ulrike merten , told german public radio that the military was not overburdened and a study has shown that up to 14,000 troops could be sent overseas .
she said it was " unfortunate " to link a possible pull-out from bosnia with other missions in other parts of the globe . the green party would like to see more german troops head abroad , perhaps as many as 16,000 . " we have to prepare the german public for the fact that we 'll probably get more requests -lrb- for soldiers -rrb- in the future than fewer , " said kerstin müller , the party 's foreign policy spokesman in the parliament . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers admit to taking horrific photos the bundeswehr said three of its soldiers have owned up to posing for pictures with human skulls in afghanistan , but questions remain as to what the military knew about the scandal and when .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- chancellor unleashes new defense spending debate in recent years , germany 's army has changed drastically and some say should change more .
created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion .
-lrb- 07.09.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deligöz says head scarves hinder integration deligöz , who was born in turkey but grew up in germany , addressed muslim women living in germany in a newspaper article recently , saying : " wake up to today 's germany .
this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .

but the bloc is making closer cooperation dependent on progress regarding the country 's human rights situation and democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev critics of the government say kazakh leader nursultan nazarbayev has all but eliminated the opposition , cracked down on press freedom and done little to fight corruption and red tape . a meeting with nazarbayev , who since 1991 has enjoyed absolute power , is not expected , although it was announced that nazarbayev would visit berlin at the end of 2007 . osce chair so far , steinmeier has met with kazakhstan 's prime minister danial akhmetov and foreign minister kasymzhomart tokayev as well as representatives of the estimated 230,000 to 360,000 ethnic germans living in the country . topics for the talks included kazakhstan 's candidacy for the chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- in 2009 .
the united states and britain have asked the country to delay its chair until 2011 , which tokayev has refused .
berlin is making its support contingent on political reforms . steinmeier has said he would support kazakhstan 's acceptance into the world trade organization , the negotiations for which are in their final phase and should be decided in early 2007 .
the german foreign minister flies to uzbekistan on wednesday and is expected to visit the other central asian states of turkmenistan , tajikistan and kyrgyzstan later in the week .

but the bloc is making closer cooperation dependent on progress regarding the country 's human rights situation and democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev critics of the government say kazakh leader nursultan nazarbayev has all but eliminated the opposition , cracked down on press freedom and done little to fight corruption and red tape . a meeting with nazarbayev , who since 1991 has enjoyed absolute power , is not expected , although it was announced that nazarbayev would visit berlin at the end of 2007 . osce chair so far , steinmeier has met with kazakhstan 's prime minister danial akhmetov and foreign minister kasymzhomart tokayev as well as representatives of the estimated 230,000 to 360,000 ethnic germans living in the country . topics for the talks included kazakhstan 's candidacy for the chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- in 2009 .
the united states and britain have asked the country to delay its chair until 2011 , which tokayev has refused .
berlin is making its support contingent on political reforms . steinmeier has said he would support kazakhstan 's acceptance into the world trade organization , the negotiations for which are in their final phase and should be decided in early 2007 .
the german foreign minister flies to uzbekistan on wednesday and is expected to visit the other central asian states of turkmenistan , tajikistan and kyrgyzstan later in the week .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara .

" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .

but president mahmoud ahmadinejad said un sanctions wo n't have an impact . six members of germany 's parliamentary committee for disarmament , arms control and non-proliferation met with iranian government leaders in teheran on monday .
the german representatives made an appeal for greater transparency and mutual trust in the conflict over iran 's nuclear program . ute zapf , head of the delegation and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the talks " good and informative , " adding that re-implementing the addendum to the protocol from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would be a step in the right direction . the addendum would allow for unannounced inspections by iaea representatives and the installation of cameras in the nuclear plants . " the good news is that we are looking for open dialogue ; the bad news is that , in my opinion , the positions remain extremely rigid , " said delegation member karl-theodor guttenberg of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . un sanctions possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director said it 's still a possibility that iran is building nuclear weapons germany , great britain and france have drafted a list of proposed economic sanctions being discussed by the un security council .
russia , one of the council 's veto-holding permanent members , has so far called the measures too strict , though some members of the russian parliament said tuesday that the country would have to support the proposed sanctions .

but president mahmoud ahmadinejad said un sanctions wo n't have an impact . six members of germany 's parliamentary committee for disarmament , arms control and non-proliferation met with iranian government leaders in teheran on monday .
the german representatives made an appeal for greater transparency and mutual trust in the conflict over iran 's nuclear program . ute zapf , head of the delegation and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the talks " good and informative , " adding that re-implementing the addendum to the protocol from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would be a step in the right direction . the addendum would allow for unannounced inspections by iaea representatives and the installation of cameras in the nuclear plants . " the good news is that we are looking for open dialogue ; the bad news is that , in my opinion , the positions remain extremely rigid , " said delegation member karl-theodor guttenberg of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . un sanctions possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director said it 's still a possibility that iran is building nuclear weapons germany , great britain and france have drafted a list of proposed economic sanctions being discussed by the un security council .
russia , one of the council 's veto-holding permanent members , has so far called the measures too strict , though some members of the russian parliament said tuesday that the country would have to support the proposed sanctions . " the russian political leadership will apparently have to join a new resolution on iran proposed by britain , germany and france that envisages limited economic sanctions on iran , " yuri volkov , a deputy speaker of the state duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , said in a statement . ahmadinejad said sanctions pointless in a speech on monday in varamin near teheran , ahmadinejad said the proposed un sanctions against his country would have no impact except to " lead to more motivation of the iranian youth . " he did not refer in his speech to last week 's expansion of his country 's uranium enrichment program .
a second 164-machine nuclear centrifuge cascade , used to enrich uranium hexafluoride gas for nuclear fuel , were made operational . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad says iran 's nuclear program is peaceful , but the west is n't convinced iran continues to reject international claims that it is seeking to build atomic weapons and insists on its right to peaceful nuclear technology under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states and european union , however , remain concerned about a possible nuclear program as well as past anti-semitic statements from the iranian leader . " president ahmadinejad is sometimes a bit populist in his speeches to the population .
i think you have to always consider that , " zapf said .
" but if he says something like the holocaust never happened , or that israel should be wiped off the map , of course , we take it seriously and we have to protest against that . " iran still defiant , iaea concerned ahmadinejad 's supporters make up the majority in tehran 's parliament and in some parliamentary circles there have demands for a withdrawal from the npt in the event of sanctions , arguing that such measures would demonstrate a lack of respect for iran 's rights under the terms of the treaty . the iaea , however , has not excluded the possibility that iran is indeed building nuclear weapons .
mohamed elbaradei , head of the iaea , said in his annual report that his organization was " not in a position to confirm the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear program , which is cause for worry , " reported reuters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .
but there have been no announcements about plans to change the film before it opens in german cinemas . " will it harm the car ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat arrived in london on wednesday for the film 's uk premier the controversy centers on how one interprets the borat figure , a provincial journalist in a bad moustache and cheap suit , who spouts anti-semitic , racist and sexist prejudices in comically broken english .
for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .
they 're never given a chance to speak for themselves . " kazakhstan not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat also stirred up trouble at the 2005 mtv europe music awards this is n't the first time the borat figure has gotten cohen in trouble .
officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .

but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .
but there have been no announcements about plans to change the film before it opens in german cinemas . " will it harm the car ?

for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .
they 're never given a chance to speak for themselves . " kazakhstan not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat also stirred up trouble at the 2005 mtv europe music awards this is n't the first time the borat figure has gotten cohen in trouble .
officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .

to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .

this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .

but the bloc is making closer cooperation dependent on progress regarding the country 's human rights situation and democratic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev critics of the government say kazakh leader nursultan nazarbayev has all but eliminated the opposition , cracked down on press freedom and done little to fight corruption and red tape . a meeting with nazarbayev , who since 1991 has enjoyed absolute power , is not expected , although it was announced that nazarbayev would visit berlin at the end of 2007 . osce chair so far , steinmeier has met with kazakhstan 's prime minister danial akhmetov and foreign minister kasymzhomart tokayev as well as representatives of the estimated 230,000 to 360,000 ethnic germans living in the country . topics for the talks included kazakhstan 's candidacy for the chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- in 2009 .
the united states and britain have asked the country to delay its chair until 2011 , which tokayev has refused .
berlin is making its support contingent on political reforms . steinmeier has said he would support kazakhstan 's acceptance into the world trade organization , the negotiations for which are in their final phase and should be decided in early 2007 .
the german foreign minister flies to uzbekistan on wednesday and is expected to visit the other central asian states of turkmenistan , tajikistan and kyrgyzstan later in the week .

but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .

for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "

borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .

officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .
defense minister franz josef jung also talked this week of withdrawing troops from bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan meet with defense minister jung germany 's president , horst köhler , has called for more prudence when it comes to committing troops to hotspots abroad , although he added in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr that as a medium-sized power , germany was obliged to contribute to some foreign missions . but , he said , the missions must be carefully thought out and planned taking german foreign , development and security policy into consideration . in this area , he said , there are still things to be done . other high-ranking officials involved in defense matters had similar sentiments , including the former commander of the international peacekeeping force in kosovo , general klaus reinhardt , who worried that german peacekeepers were simply being thrown into a country with little thought given to long-term stabilization and exit strategies . " policy makers have n't yet devised a strategy that goes beyond the fact that one wants to intervene in a country , " he told the financial times deutschland .
" there is no strategy for the balkans , none for afghanistan . " overstretched ? there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some troops from bosnia are likely to come home " in some areas , we have already hit the limit , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung . on sunday , he announced that germany would begin as early as sunday to withdraw troops from bosnia and herzegovina , where troops have been involved in stabilizing the country that was ravaged by war from 1992 to 1995 . after a recent scandal involving soldiers in afghanistan posing for photographs with a skull , others say german soldiers might not be getting sufficient training to understand the cultural sensitivities they might encounter abroad . " it is a question of the capability and skill of the troops , " said michael berndsen , a defense ministry spokesman . doubts in parliament while jung said there is still wide support for foreign missions in the german parliament , which must approve them , some parliamentarians are now of the opinion that the limit has been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung " therefore we must exercise restraint regarding foreign deployments , " he said , adding that any further commitment must be carefully explained and its goals clearly laid out . after the afghanistan photo scandal , a survey by the forsa polling institute found that 46 percent of germans thought germany should reduce its foreign commitments while 50 percent thought there was no need to change the current levels .
four percent had not opinion on the subject . however , there were some calls for the bundeswehr to expand operations abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if german peacekeeping troops are being adequately prepared the chair of the defense committee of the german parliament , ulrike merten , told german public radio that the military was not overburdened and a study has shown that up to 14,000 troops could be sent overseas .
she said it was " unfortunate " to link a possible pull-out from bosnia with other missions in other parts of the globe . the green party would like to see more german troops head abroad , perhaps as many as 16,000 . " we have to prepare the german public for the fact that we 'll probably get more requests -lrb- for soldiers -rrb- in the future than fewer , " said kerstin müller , the party 's foreign policy spokesman in the parliament . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers admit to taking horrific photos the bundeswehr said three of its soldiers have owned up to posing for pictures with human skulls in afghanistan , but questions remain as to what the military knew about the scandal and when .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deligöz says head scarves hinder integration deligöz , who was born in turkey but grew up in germany , addressed muslim women living in germany in a newspaper article recently , saying : " wake up to today 's germany .
this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .

" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deligöz says head scarves hinder integration deligöz , who was born in turkey but grew up in germany , addressed muslim women living in germany in a newspaper article recently , saying : " wake up to today 's germany .
this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats .

it 's a point not just stated by the media in the two countries , but also publicly by german and polish politicians . from the polish perspective , the reasons behind the deteriorating relationship are easy to list - the baltic sea pipeline , which is supposed to transport gas from russia to germany but by carefully skirting poland and the recent clamor by german expellees . complaints on both sides the german list of complaints against warsaw is a bit longer .
ever since kaczynski 's party started dictating the pace of german-polish relations , there have been problems . the most serious difficulty is the general political atmosphere on the vistula , which serves as a breeding ground for perpetuating various anti-german prejudices .
it is not even considered reprehensible to politically stigmatize your political opponent by accusing him of being of german descent . warsaw 's destructive attitudes toward financing the german-polish youth organization , the halting of work on many committees -lrb- like the one responsible for boat traffic on the oder river -rrb- , and cultural exchange are all on the german list of negatives . berlin 's most frequent criticism is that the polish side does n't operate cooperatively , blocks germany 's propositions and is not interested in constructively working together .
not great prospects for germany 's upcoming eu presidency . visit alone is a sign of progress considering the long list of accusations from both sides , it is not surprising that the fact that prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski did actually manage to visit berlin at all is considered a success unto itself . but that 's not all . the visit did bring about a thaw in frosty relations in some areas .
the money the polish government owned the german-polish youth organization has already come in , for example .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2006 opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan . in the 17 years since the collapse of the soviet union , german-polish relations have seldom been as bad as they are now .
it 's a point not just stated by the media in the two countries , but also publicly by german and polish politicians . from the polish perspective , the reasons behind the deteriorating relationship are easy to list - the baltic sea pipeline , which is supposed to transport gas from russia to germany but by carefully skirting poland and the recent clamor by german expellees . complaints on both sides the german list of complaints against warsaw is a bit longer .
ever since kaczynski 's party started dictating the pace of german-polish relations , there have been problems . the most serious difficulty is the general political atmosphere on the vistula , which serves as a breeding ground for perpetuating various anti-german prejudices .
it is not even considered reprehensible to politically stigmatize your political opponent by accusing him of being of german descent . warsaw 's destructive attitudes toward financing the german-polish youth organization , the halting of work on many committees -lrb- like the one responsible for boat traffic on the oder river -rrb- , and cultural exchange are all on the german list of negatives . berlin 's most frequent criticism is that the polish side does n't operate cooperatively , blocks germany 's propositions and is not interested in constructively working together .
not great prospects for germany 's upcoming eu presidency . visit alone is a sign of progress considering the long list of accusations from both sides , it is not surprising that the fact that prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski did actually manage to visit berlin at all is considered a success unto itself . but that 's not all . the visit did bring about a thaw in frosty relations in some areas .
the money the polish government owned the german-polish youth organization has already come in , for example .
as is often the case at such events , both sides praised the youth organization 's success - which still does n't make it immune to future blows . there are signs that the controversial pipeline issue may be resolved . russia wo n't turn off the taps , thus ensuring that poland wo n't be cut off from gas supplies from moscow .
a european energy market is to be established to provide energy security to all eu members , including poland . both sides can be pleased jaroslaw kaczynski can return to warsaw satisfied .
the charm offensive he 's begun will at least keep poland out of the german headlines for a while . and angela merkel can exhale a sigh of relief because the poles are going to start acting a bit more constructively instead of boycotting germany 's eu presidency . hubert wohlan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .

a special task force will now deal with violence and racism in german stadiums . the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , and bundesliga president werner hackmann called the summit after scores of arrests and 23 injured policeman at lower-division matches over the weekend .
in addition to the task force , the dfb will name a full-time security official to coordinate the group 's various efforts to prevent violence . after the meeting , zwanziger said the task force would adopt a two-pronged approach .
" on the one hand , " he said , " we 'll make full use of our legal options and hand out tough punishments .
on the other hand , we 'll work to educate people and create the necessary awareness though better training of our employees and intensive preventative measures - for example , in conjunction with fan projects and fan groups . " last weekend 's violence underscored the need for action .
in the worst incident , 23 policeman were hurt after fans of third-division dynamo dresden tried to storm the field at an away match against hertha berlin 's amateurs .
a total of 22 people were taken into custody in the conflict . " security officials were pelted with gas cartridges and plastic seats , " a spokesman for the berlin police told die welt newspaper on monday .
" our colleagues had to defend themselves with batons and pepper spray . " in other clashes , police used pepper spray and arrested 21 people at a second-division match between southern german sides augsburg and 1860 munich .

it only serves to encourage hooliganism , when , as is the case here , team leaders turn hooligans into the victims and the police officials who were attacked into the victims . " the dfb is currently investigating dyanamo dresden 's role in that incident .
zwanziger has also threatened disciplinary measures , if there is a repeat of last weekend 's mayhem at dresden 's match against union berlin on saturday . " points that arise by the use of violence are not the sort of points we want to hand out in german soccer , " zwanziger said in a television interview . not the police 's job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 22 dynamo dresden fans were detained over the weekend according to the central information office for sports security deployments -lrb- zis -rrb- in düsseldorf , the incidents in berlin and augsburg are less the exception than the norm . " what happened last weekend is regrettable but not new , " zis director michael endler told the financial times deutschland .
" the statistics we have about incidents of this sort show that the situation has existed for five or six years .

the two-day conference will look at ways to reverse the europe-wide trend of a falling birth rate and a graying population that experts fear might have a devastating effect on the continent 's economy as well as social structure . governments in the european union must set up more flexible working conditions , such as cuts in working hours when parents are caring for younger children , to be made up at a later stage in life , vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment commissioner told reporters on monday . " staying at home and taking care of the kids should not mean losing out in a career , " said spidla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates are plummeting across most of europe eu member states need to draw up policies that would enable women to balance their work with having the number of children they want , spidla added . most europeans would actually like to have at two children . " fathers who stay at home are not wimps .
and working mothers are not rabenmutter , -lrb- a derogatory german term for women who are not stay-at-home mums -rrb- , " said spidla . sinking birth rates the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . the birthrate in germany , at 1.36 per woman , is slightly below the european union average . " in the future , we will have to look at all policies through demographic glasses , " said spidla .
" changes will be evident in the labor market , the health care and pension system , but demographic ageing will also be a challenge for our educational systems , our urban planning , housing facilities or infrastructure . " spidla welcomed germany 's plans for setting up a " european alliance for families " aimed at supporting family friendly work policies in eu member states .
germany takes over the rotating eu presidency from finland in january . the eu , however , would not plan any concrete legal proposals to tackle the lack of a good balance between work and family life but leave mapping out new policies to the bloc 's member states . policy tools to battle trend " family-friendliness is also a major location factor for european enterprises engaged in global competition , " said german minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen , adding that a balance between work and family life would also increase productivity . von der leyen , a mother of seven , also presented new german initiatives such as the introduction of a salary for parents , which will amount to a maximum of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,284 -rrb- per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : policies that enable fathers to take a more active parenting role finnish minister for social affairs , tuula haatainen called for " universal childcare services " to help in particular women better unite career and family life . the eu commission earlier this month presented a new strategy to address demographic change in the 25-member union .
the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- is expected to shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , taking into account 1.8 million immigrants annually . falling birth rates , rising life expectancy and the retirement of the baby-boomer generation mean that by 2050 , two workers will be paying for one pensioner . in almost all european countries , having a child pushed down the employment rate of women between 20-49 years by more than 14 percent , while it drove up men 's by almost 6 percent , the commission said earlier . the continuing struggle to balance work and home not only forces women to quit their job , but also lowers fertility rates , the eu executive said , adding that this had a negative impact on the bloc 's already sluggish economy . national action plans drawn up by member states so far ' showed less visibility and a loss of momentum of gender issues , ' according to the commission . dw staff / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : men in germany are scared to start families low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births .
-lrb- 29.06.2006 -rrb- german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .
they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves .
-lrb- 25.04.2006 -rrb- new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .
a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money .
-lrb- 21.04.2006 -rrb- labor policies need changes as germans live longer a shift in demographics means germany should alter its labor policies to encourage more older people to continue working as the average life span grows and the birth rate stagnates , according to some experts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 31.10.2006 opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan . in the 17 years since the collapse of the soviet union , german-polish relations have seldom been as bad as they are now .
it 's a point not just stated by the media in the two countries , but also publicly by german and polish politicians . from the polish perspective , the reasons behind the deteriorating relationship are easy to list - the baltic sea pipeline , which is supposed to transport gas from russia to germany but by carefully skirting poland and the recent clamor by german expellees . complaints on both sides the german list of complaints against warsaw is a bit longer .
ever since kaczynski 's party started dictating the pace of german-polish relations , there have been problems . the most serious difficulty is the general political atmosphere on the vistula , which serves as a breeding ground for perpetuating various anti-german prejudices .
it is not even considered reprehensible to politically stigmatize your political opponent by accusing him of being of german descent . warsaw 's destructive attitudes toward financing the german-polish youth organization , the halting of work on many committees -lrb- like the one responsible for boat traffic on the oder river -rrb- , and cultural exchange are all on the german list of negatives . berlin 's most frequent criticism is that the polish side does n't operate cooperatively , blocks germany 's propositions and is not interested in constructively working together .
not great prospects for germany 's upcoming eu presidency . visit alone is a sign of progress considering the long list of accusations from both sides , it is not surprising that the fact that prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski did actually manage to visit berlin at all is considered a success unto itself . but that 's not all . the visit did bring about a thaw in frosty relations in some areas .
the money the polish government owned the german-polish youth organization has already come in , for example .
as is often the case at such events , both sides praised the youth organization 's success - which still does n't make it immune to future blows . there are signs that the controversial pipeline issue may be resolved . russia wo n't turn off the taps , thus ensuring that poland wo n't be cut off from gas supplies from moscow .
a european energy market is to be established to provide energy security to all eu members , including poland . both sides can be pleased jaroslaw kaczynski can return to warsaw satisfied .
the charm offensive he 's begun will at least keep poland out of the german headlines for a while . and angela merkel can exhale a sigh of relief because the poles are going to start acting a bit more constructively instead of boycotting germany 's eu presidency . hubert wohlan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? -lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- polish prime minister meets german chancellor during his first official visit to germany , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski addressed a number of issues in berlin on monday which he said were continuing to raise concerns back home .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- germany hopes for better ties as polish premier visits berlin following a series of controversies that cloud german-polish relations , poland 's premier visits berlin monday .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara . " this is a critical report , the pace of reforms has slowed , " a european source said on tuesday , stressing at the same time that ankara has made progress in some areas . commission officials were refusing to comment on the report 's contents until it is issued on nov .

" what is important is that there is a balanced outcome in the end , " he said . the turkish parliament has already adopted a large proportion of legislative measures sought by brussels , notably laws creating a mediator charged with ruling on disputes between citizens and the state and putting an end to discrimination against ethnic roma . only a debate on increasing religious freedom and in particular restoring property to non-muslim religious groups remains under discussion . the cyprus question however , the report will criticize turkey over its continued refusal to grant cyprus access to its ports and airports . turkey is obliged to open its ports and airports to vessels flying the flag of cyprus , even though ankara does not does not recognize the country , under a 2005 protocol extending its customs union agreement to new eu countries including the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession process will take at least ten years ankara refuses to do so unless the eu makes good on its promises to end the international isolation of the turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , which only turkey recognizes as a state . the eu has warned turkey that failure to honor its obligations under the customs union agreement could result in a suspension of its membership talks with the bloc that began last year .
the threat is especially strong since cyprus has a veto right on turkish adhesion . the commission 's report will also be " very critical on the freedom of expression , " the european source said . article 301 eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn has for months called for the modification or scrapping of article 301 of turkey 's penal code under which dozens of writers and authors have been pursued by the courts , including 2006 nobel literature prize winner orhan pamuk . however , the report circulating in brussels remains in a draft version and the commission will also be keeping a close eye on the upcoming finnish talks . the finnish compromise plan focuses on the lifting of the trade embargo with the statelet of northern cyprus and the reciprocal opening of turkey 's ports to cypriot vessels . the report may fuel already widespread doubts among europeans over whether turkey will ever be ready for eu membership , but officials in brussels insist it is only an early snapshot of reforms in an accession process that will likely last a decade a least . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award .

the european commission is set to deal a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes next week with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus . the report will focus on the slowdown of political reforms since turkey began accession negotiations last october .
it will highlight the continued persecution of intellectuals and journalists for expressing views which are non-violent , but displeasing to the government in ankara .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .
defense minister franz josef jung also talked this week of withdrawing troops from bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan meet with defense minister jung germany 's president , horst köhler , has called for more prudence when it comes to committing troops to hotspots abroad , although he added in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr that as a medium-sized power , germany was obliged to contribute to some foreign missions . but , he said , the missions must be carefully thought out and planned taking german foreign , development and security policy into consideration . in this area , he said , there are still things to be done . other high-ranking officials involved in defense matters had similar sentiments , including the former commander of the international peacekeeping force in kosovo , general klaus reinhardt , who worried that german peacekeepers were simply being thrown into a country with little thought given to long-term stabilization and exit strategies . " policy makers have n't yet devised a strategy that goes beyond the fact that one wants to intervene in a country , " he told the financial times deutschland .
" there is no strategy for the balkans , none for afghanistan . " overstretched ? there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some troops from bosnia are likely to come home " in some areas , we have already hit the limit , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung . on sunday , he announced that germany would begin as early as sunday to withdraw troops from bosnia and herzegovina , where troops have been involved in stabilizing the country that was ravaged by war from 1992 to 1995 . after a recent scandal involving soldiers in afghanistan posing for photographs with a skull , others say german soldiers might not be getting sufficient training to understand the cultural sensitivities they might encounter abroad . " it is a question of the capability and skill of the troops , " said michael berndsen , a defense ministry spokesman . doubts in parliament while jung said there is still wide support for foreign missions in the german parliament , which must approve them , some parliamentarians are now of the opinion that the limit has been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung " therefore we must exercise restraint regarding foreign deployments , " he said , adding that any further commitment must be carefully explained and its goals clearly laid out . after the afghanistan photo scandal , a survey by the forsa polling institute found that 46 percent of germans thought germany should reduce its foreign commitments while 50 percent thought there was no need to change the current levels .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .

german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad . for decades after world war ii , the prospect of german soldiers being stationed in any foreign country was taboo .
but since reunification , the german military is being called upon increasingly to contribute troops to united nations or nato-sponsored operations abroad . right now , there are some 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions , including the democratic republic of congo , the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan . but in recent days , a debate has broken out over whether germany has been too fast to agree to send troops abroad and if berlin 's willingness to participate in various foreign deployments has overstretched its military .
the debate comes a week after the unveiling of a new long-term vision for the germany military which foresees it playing a stronger role internationally .
defense minister franz josef jung also talked this week of withdrawing troops from bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan meet with defense minister jung germany 's president , horst köhler , has called for more prudence when it comes to committing troops to hotspots abroad , although he added in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr that as a medium-sized power , germany was obliged to contribute to some foreign missions . but , he said , the missions must be carefully thought out and planned taking german foreign , development and security policy into consideration . in this area , he said , there are still things to be done . other high-ranking officials involved in defense matters had similar sentiments , including the former commander of the international peacekeeping force in kosovo , general klaus reinhardt , who worried that german peacekeepers were simply being thrown into a country with little thought given to long-term stabilization and exit strategies . " policy makers have n't yet devised a strategy that goes beyond the fact that one wants to intervene in a country , " he told the financial times deutschland .
" there is no strategy for the balkans , none for afghanistan . " overstretched ? there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are 2,800 soldiers in afghanistan , 2,844 in kosovo and 750 in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some troops from bosnia are likely to come home " in some areas , we have already hit the limit , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung . on sunday , he announced that germany would begin as early as sunday to withdraw troops from bosnia and herzegovina , where troops have been involved in stabilizing the country that was ravaged by war from 1992 to 1995 . after a recent scandal involving soldiers in afghanistan posing for photographs with a skull , others say german soldiers might not be getting sufficient training to understand the cultural sensitivities they might encounter abroad . " it is a question of the capability and skill of the troops , " said michael berndsen , a defense ministry spokesman . doubts in parliament while jung said there is still wide support for foreign missions in the german parliament , which must approve them , some parliamentarians are now of the opinion that the limit has been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung " therefore we must exercise restraint regarding foreign deployments , " he said , adding that any further commitment must be carefully explained and its goals clearly laid out . after the afghanistan photo scandal , a survey by the forsa polling institute found that 46 percent of germans thought germany should reduce its foreign commitments while 50 percent thought there was no need to change the current levels .
four percent had not opinion on the subject . however , there were some calls for the bundeswehr to expand operations abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if german peacekeeping troops are being adequately prepared the chair of the defense committee of the german parliament , ulrike merten , told german public radio that the military was not overburdened and a study has shown that up to 14,000 troops could be sent overseas .
she said it was " unfortunate " to link a possible pull-out from bosnia with other missions in other parts of the globe . the green party would like to see more german troops head abroad , perhaps as many as 16,000 . " we have to prepare the german public for the fact that we 'll probably get more requests -lrb- for soldiers -rrb- in the future than fewer , " said kerstin müller , the party 's foreign policy spokesman in the parliament . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers admit to taking horrific photos the bundeswehr said three of its soldiers have owned up to posing for pictures with human skulls in afghanistan , but questions remain as to what the military knew about the scandal and when .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- chancellor unleashes new defense spending debate in recent years , germany 's army has changed drastically and some say should change more .
created in the cold war era , the bundeswehr no longer has to worry about defending its eastern border from a soviet tank invasion .
-lrb- 07.09.2006 -rrb- germany wants to pull troops out of bosnia from december berlin will begin gradually withdrawing its troops deployed with the international peacekeeping force in bosnia as early as december , german defense minister franz josef jung announced .
-lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- surveys do you think the bundeswehr should reduce its involvement in crisis areas abroad ?

most said they were n't surprised by the scandal . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a veteran of the war in iraq , i find myself completely unsurprised at these photos .
of course , the photos are shocking and the world has not seen german soldiers acting in such a manner for many years .
but is anyone really surprised ?
to charge someone with moral misconduct in a war , to coin the line from a famous war movie : " is a bit like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " .
i can not think of any military in the world that is innocent of such crimes .
a proper response should include better training , supervision , and of course , holding those responsible accountable .
but to draw any wider conclusions is a hysteric overreaction that belongs in the tabloids . - andy j. , usa it is unfortunate the young men posed with skulls , but the fact they were skulls means the bodies were dead before the german soldiers got there , so they did not kill the people .
in any case i see no broader implication than that the skulls were there in a former battle zone and they showed disrespect for the dead , friend or foe , whoever they were . - donal o 'collaugh , dublin i think the german soldiers involved in ' skull gate ' are guilty of very bad judgment .
still , i think any punishment administered should be somewhat light .
i can think of worse crimes than posing with the skulls of those long since deceased .
decapitating a bound and frightened civilian journalist or contractor live on television comes to mind . - jeff n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has come under scrutiny following the scandal the german government should handle this affair with their soldiers and the us should mind their own business . - joyce purdue it is laughable , very laughable and unbelievable the comments of the british and french .
for all the atrocities committed by both armies in their territories in africa they have the audacity to point fingers at germans ? - ernst stetz any one who thinks that this is an isolated incident has never served in the military .
this happens whenever you dehumanize the opponent .
these same atrocities are taking place in all of the nato and coalition military services .
it is a virus that ends up dehumanizing the soldier who does the act and the combatant who experiences the act .
after a soldier has done something like this , do you think that he can go back to civilian life and forget this ever happened ? - lee cisco one question for those expressing outrage over the photos - have you ever been in combat or a war zone for an extended time ?
troops all over the world do this kind of thing as a means of relieving stress from being in a hostile environment .
if you have a problem , then bring the troops home , and never send them in harm 's way ever again . - arden reinhardt knapp the german soldiers , who did the disrespectful actions to the dead , should be punished as they do n't represent the germans , they represent the worst of mankind . - babiker , sudan no matter where you go in the world , there is always somebody who has enlisted as a soldier letting off steam or just showing he is a tough guy , basically being scared like anyone else , but covering up without realizing the cruelty of the prank he performs .
one must grant allowances even if their actions are not understandable .
soldiers are soldiers but they are also human beings with all their shortcomings . - h.h. fehse compilied by dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reconsiders sending troops on foreign missions senior politicians on sunday said germany should rethink its role in foreign peacekeeping missions as the scandal over soldiers playing with skulls in afghanistan battered the army 's image .

the german representatives made an appeal for greater transparency and mutual trust in the conflict over iran 's nuclear program . ute zapf , head of the delegation and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the talks " good and informative , " adding that re-implementing the addendum to the protocol from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would be a step in the right direction . the addendum would allow for unannounced inspections by iaea representatives and the installation of cameras in the nuclear plants .

the two-day conference will look at ways to reverse the europe-wide trend of a falling birth rate and a graying population that experts fear might have a devastating effect on the continent 's economy as well as social structure . governments in the european union must set up more flexible working conditions , such as cuts in working hours when parents are caring for younger children , to be made up at a later stage in life , vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment commissioner told reporters on monday . " staying at home and taking care of the kids should not mean losing out in a career , " said spidla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates are plummeting across most of europe eu member states need to draw up policies that would enable women to balance their work with having the number of children they want , spidla added . most europeans would actually like to have at two children . " fathers who stay at home are not wimps .
and working mothers are not rabenmutter , -lrb- a derogatory german term for women who are not stay-at-home mums -rrb- , " said spidla . sinking birth rates the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . the birthrate in germany , at 1.36 per woman , is slightly below the european union average .

the two-day conference will look at ways to reverse the europe-wide trend of a falling birth rate and a graying population that experts fear might have a devastating effect on the continent 's economy as well as social structure . governments in the european union must set up more flexible working conditions , such as cuts in working hours when parents are caring for younger children , to be made up at a later stage in life , vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment commissioner told reporters on monday . " staying at home and taking care of the kids should not mean losing out in a career , " said spidla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates are plummeting across most of europe eu member states need to draw up policies that would enable women to balance their work with having the number of children they want , spidla added . most europeans would actually like to have at two children . " fathers who stay at home are not wimps .
and working mothers are not rabenmutter , -lrb- a derogatory german term for women who are not stay-at-home mums -rrb- , " said spidla . sinking birth rates the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . the birthrate in germany , at 1.36 per woman , is slightly below the european union average . " in the future , we will have to look at all policies through demographic glasses , " said spidla .
" changes will be evident in the labor market , the health care and pension system , but demographic ageing will also be a challenge for our educational systems , our urban planning , housing facilities or infrastructure .

but president mahmoud ahmadinejad said un sanctions wo n't have an impact . six members of germany 's parliamentary committee for disarmament , arms control and non-proliferation met with iranian government leaders in teheran on monday .
the german representatives made an appeal for greater transparency and mutual trust in the conflict over iran 's nuclear program . ute zapf , head of the delegation and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called the talks " good and informative , " adding that re-implementing the addendum to the protocol from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- would be a step in the right direction . the addendum would allow for unannounced inspections by iaea representatives and the installation of cameras in the nuclear plants . " the good news is that we are looking for open dialogue ; the bad news is that , in my opinion , the positions remain extremely rigid , " said delegation member karl-theodor guttenberg of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . un sanctions possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director said it 's still a possibility that iran is building nuclear weapons germany , great britain and france have drafted a list of proposed economic sanctions being discussed by the un security council .
russia , one of the council 's veto-holding permanent members , has so far called the measures too strict , though some members of the russian parliament said tuesday that the country would have to support the proposed sanctions . " the russian political leadership will apparently have to join a new resolution on iran proposed by britain , germany and france that envisages limited economic sanctions on iran , " yuri volkov , a deputy speaker of the state duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , said in a statement . ahmadinejad said sanctions pointless in a speech on monday in varamin near teheran , ahmadinejad said the proposed un sanctions against his country would have no impact except to " lead to more motivation of the iranian youth . " he did not refer in his speech to last week 's expansion of his country 's uranium enrichment program .
a second 164-machine nuclear centrifuge cascade , used to enrich uranium hexafluoride gas for nuclear fuel , were made operational . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad says iran 's nuclear program is peaceful , but the west is n't convinced iran continues to reject international claims that it is seeking to build atomic weapons and insists on its right to peaceful nuclear technology under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the united states and european union , however , remain concerned about a possible nuclear program as well as past anti-semitic statements from the iranian leader . " president ahmadinejad is sometimes a bit populist in his speeches to the population .
i think you have to always consider that , " zapf said .
" but if he says something like the holocaust never happened , or that israel should be wiped off the map , of course , we take it seriously and we have to protest against that . " iran still defiant , iaea concerned ahmadinejad 's supporters make up the majority in tehran 's parliament and in some parliamentary circles there have demands for a withdrawal from the npt in the event of sanctions , arguing that such measures would demonstrate a lack of respect for iran 's rights under the terms of the treaty . the iaea , however , has not excluded the possibility that iran is indeed building nuclear weapons .
mohamed elbaradei , head of the iaea , said in his annual report that his organization was " not in a position to confirm the peaceful nature of iran 's nuclear program , which is cause for worry , " reported reuters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

but sinti and roma groups say borat is racist and are asking german courts to intervene . german fans of british comedian sacha baron cohen , better known to many as ali g , have been eagerly awaiting the nov .
2 release of his new film borat : cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan . the " mockumentary " featuring a bigoted , fictional reporter from kazakhstan travelling around the united states satirizes the often shocking prejudices of ordinary americans .
but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .
but there have been no announcements about plans to change the film before it opens in german cinemas . " will it harm the car ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat arrived in london on wednesday for the film 's uk premier the controversy centers on how one interprets the borat figure , a provincial journalist in a bad moustache and cheap suit , who spouts anti-semitic , racist and sexist prejudices in comically broken english .
for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .
they 're never given a chance to speak for themselves . " kazakhstan not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat also stirred up trouble at the 2005 mtv europe music awards this is n't the first time the borat figure has gotten cohen in trouble .

but sinti and roma groups say borat is racist and are asking german courts to intervene . german fans of british comedian sacha baron cohen , better known to many as ali g , have been eagerly awaiting the nov .
2 release of his new film borat : cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan . the " mockumentary " featuring a bigoted , fictional reporter from kazakhstan travelling around the united states satirizes the often shocking prejudices of ordinary americans .
but the satire has fallen flat with sinti and roma in germany , who say the movie itself is discriminatory . the european center for anti-ziganism research or ezaf in hamburg has filed a series of criminal complaints , arguing that the movie incites violence against sinti and roma .
court cases are pending in five german cities against cohen , the film 's german distributor , 20th century fox , and a number of television stations and newspapers that ran promotional material for the movie . in response , 20th century fox removed all scenes with references to " gypsies , " a term sinti and roma consider offensive , from television promotional spots for the film .
it also took the movie 's german-language website off-line . 20th century fox germany sales director mychael berg wrote to the ezaf assuring the organization that the distributor had no intention of insulting sinti and roma .
but there have been no announcements about plans to change the film before it opens in german cinemas . " will it harm the car ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat arrived in london on wednesday for the film 's uk premier the controversy centers on how one interprets the borat figure , a provincial journalist in a bad moustache and cheap suit , who spouts anti-semitic , racist and sexist prejudices in comically broken english .
for fans , cohen , who is jewish , uses his alter ego as a means of revealing and ridiculing the deep-seated biases of his unwitting interview partners . but detractors worry that cohen 's wildly popular figure also makes prejudice seem cool .
sinti and roma in germany have objected in particular to one film scene between borat and a provincial american car dealer . borat : " if i drive through a crowd of gypsies , will it do any harm to the car ? "
car dealer : " it depends on how hard you gonna hit them . "
borat : " really hard . " for the chairman of the ezaf , marko d. knudsen , scenes like this amount to an incitement to violence against sinti and roma . " the satire is n't put into context , " knudsen said .
" in contrast to other groups satirized in the film , such as feminists , sinti and roma are invisible .
they 're never given a chance to speak for themselves . " kazakhstan not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borat also stirred up trouble at the 2005 mtv europe music awards this is n't the first time the borat figure has gotten cohen in trouble .
officials for the kazakh government have repeatedly protested against the caricature , saying it casts their country in a poor light . in early october , the kazakh ambassador to the uk wrote a long article for the guardian newspaper accusing cohen of slandering the former soviet republic . the overwhelming majority of internet respondents disagreed , saying the satiric intent of cohen 's parody was obvious .
still , 20th century fox in america has decided to restrict the release of the borat movie in the us to 800 cinemas - instead of the 2000 originally planned . there is no word on when the courts involved in the german cases may reach their decisions .
but if borat opens as planned on thursday in germany , there 'll be lots of laughter among fans - and lots of aggravation among groups that feel they 're being exploited as easy targets . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new comic tests germans ' ability to laugh at hitler the third reich has always provided rich comedic possibilities for other countries looking to poke fun at the germans .

a special task force will now deal with violence and racism in german stadiums . the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , and bundesliga president werner hackmann called the summit after scores of arrests and 23 injured policeman at lower-division matches over the weekend .
in addition to the task force , the dfb will name a full-time security official to coordinate the group 's various efforts to prevent violence . after the meeting , zwanziger said the task force would adopt a two-pronged approach .
" on the one hand , " he said , " we 'll make full use of our legal options and hand out tough punishments .
on the other hand , we 'll work to educate people and create the necessary awareness though better training of our employees and intensive preventative measures - for example , in conjunction with fan projects and fan groups . " last weekend 's violence underscored the need for action .
in the worst incident , 23 policeman were hurt after fans of third-division dynamo dresden tried to storm the field at an away match against hertha berlin 's amateurs .
a total of 22 people were taken into custody in the conflict . " security officials were pelted with gas cartridges and plastic seats , " a spokesman for the berlin police told die welt newspaper on monday .

" it 's not ok when someone is threatened " for exercising that right .
he called on politicians to do everything they could to throw their weight behind deligöz . the green party 's co-leader in parliament , renate künast , has already complained to turkey 's ambassador in berlin of " unacceptable " reactions in turkish media to deligöz ' comments . newspapers in turkey had called deligöz a " turkish nazi " and a " disgrace to mankind . " meeting with islamic groups künast invited several islamic organizations for discussions on tuesday , including the islamic council , the turkish association of berlin and brandenburg and the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs .
several representatives stressed that they did not agree with deligöz ' opinion , but condemned the threats she had received . " what she said is nonsense to me , " said chairman of the turkish community in germany , kenan kolat .
but he added that it was important that " she is allowed to spread this nonsense .

this is where you live , so take off your veils . " after the meeting on tuesday , deligöz stressed that she would not allow herself to be intimidated , and that she stood by her opinion on headscarves in germany . " i am going to live my life from now on just as i have up to now , " she said .
" i stand by my comments and i have no reason to deviate from them whatsoever . " integration of germany 's muslim population has been a hot-button issue in germany for some time .
it has become a priority for chancellor angela merkel 's government as concern grows about islamic radicalisation across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims in the country , who are mostly turks . recent moves by a theater in berlin to cancel a opera that featured the severing of the heads of religious figures , including that of prophet mohammed , for fear of islamist attacks was strongly condemned by politicians .
though the opera has since been reinstated , the incident has served to underline the growing debate on freedom of speech in europe and whether it should have limits when it comes to offending religious sensibilities . support from the right wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservative christian democratic parliamentary group , called on germany and its leaders to " show some backbone . " " she -lrb- deligöz -rrb- has earned the unconditional support of all of civilized society , " he told the broadcaster n-tv . bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein , member of the christian social union , said : " it 's sad when backward-looking circles take something as matter of course as the call to take off the headscarf as a reason to issue death threats .

the two-day conference will look at ways to reverse the europe-wide trend of a falling birth rate and a graying population that experts fear might have a devastating effect on the continent 's economy as well as social structure . governments in the european union must set up more flexible working conditions , such as cuts in working hours when parents are caring for younger children , to be made up at a later stage in life , vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment commissioner told reporters on monday . " staying at home and taking care of the kids should not mean losing out in a career , " said spidla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birth rates are plummeting across most of europe eu member states need to draw up policies that would enable women to balance their work with having the number of children they want , spidla added . most europeans would actually like to have at two children . " fathers who stay at home are not wimps .
and working mothers are not rabenmutter , -lrb- a derogatory german term for women who are not stay-at-home mums -rrb- , " said spidla . sinking birth rates the average number of children per woman across the eu is at 1.5 , but 2.1 are needed to replace a previous generation . the birthrate in germany , at 1.36 per woman , is slightly below the european union average . " in the future , we will have to look at all policies through demographic glasses , " said spidla .
" changes will be evident in the labor market , the health care and pension system , but demographic ageing will also be a challenge for our educational systems , our urban planning , housing facilities or infrastructure . " spidla welcomed germany 's plans for setting up a " european alliance for families " aimed at supporting family friendly work policies in eu member states .
germany takes over the rotating eu presidency from finland in january . the eu , however , would not plan any concrete legal proposals to tackle the lack of a good balance between work and family life but leave mapping out new policies to the bloc 's member states . policy tools to battle trend " family-friendliness is also a major location factor for european enterprises engaged in global competition , " said german minister for family affairs ursula von der leyen , adding that a balance between work and family life would also increase productivity . von der leyen , a mother of seven , also presented new german initiatives such as the introduction of a salary for parents , which will amount to a maximum of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,284 -rrb- per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : policies that enable fathers to take a more active parenting role finnish minister for social affairs , tuula haatainen called for " universal childcare services " to help in particular women better unite career and family life . the eu commission earlier this month presented a new strategy to address demographic change in the 25-member union .
the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- is expected to shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , taking into account 1.8 million immigrants annually . falling birth rates , rising life expectancy and the retirement of the baby-boomer generation mean that by 2050 , two workers will be paying for one pensioner . in almost all european countries , having a child pushed down the employment rate of women between 20-49 years by more than 14 percent , while it drove up men 's by almost 6 percent , the commission said earlier . the continuing struggle to balance work and home not only forces women to quit their job , but also lowers fertility rates , the eu executive said , adding that this had a negative impact on the bloc 's already sluggish economy . national action plans drawn up by member states so far ' showed less visibility and a loss of momentum of gender issues , ' according to the commission . dw staff / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : study : men in germany are scared to start families low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births .
-lrb- 29.06.2006 -rrb- dw-world : german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .
they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money .

in television interviews , he said the emphasis would be economic development , the redistribution of wealth from rich to poor , and education .
lula , as the left-leaning president is known , won more than 60 % of the vote in sunday 's poll , beating his rival geraldo alckmin .
he interprets that as a mandate to continue prioritising the poor .
speaking on brazilian television , the president said a layer of brazilian society had for centuries been marginalised and if those people could be levered up into the middle class everyone would benefit .
in the coming days lula 's challenge is to assemble a solid coalition in brazil 's parliament , and some commentators are pessimistic about prospects for significant legislation .
" i believe that lula will have a very difficult time in brazil for the next four years , " said claudio cuto , a politics professor at the catholic pontificate university of sao paulo .
" governments in brazil need to change the constitution if they want to govern , " he said , adding that the government and the opposition were sharply polarised .
" if you want , for example , to change the tax structures in brazil you have to amend a constitution and so you need super majorities to do it . "
a majority consisting of 60 % of the votes is needed in both the senate and the lower house of the congress to amend the constitution .
such is the challenge in securing that level of support that many here believe change to the political system itself should be the top priority .

at the same time , other data showed average monthly household spending down by 6 % in september compared with a year ago , the biggest fall in five years .
the reports come a day after news that industrial output fell 0.7 % last month .
meanwhile , the bank of japan left its key interest rate at 0.25 % after its latest meeting .
the bank ended its zero interest rate policy in july .
the bank of japan said on tuesday it would gradually adjust monetary policy based on economic and price conditions .
analysts believe this is further indication it may raise interest rates early next year .
pay levels japan 's economy had seen a gradual revival earlier this year after a decade in the deflation doldrums .
accelerating growth , falling unemployment , and a strong economic performance had pushed japan out of a deflationary spiral , and created the confidence to finally raise interest rates .
while the rate of unemployment rose in september from the month before , the figures also showed that the total number of unemployed fell by 50,000 from a year earlier to 2.8 million .
however , analysts said the recent economic figures meant that any further rate rises were likely to be postponed until the start of 2007 .
nli research institute senior economist taro saito said the sustained fall in household spending was due to the unwillingness of japanese firms to increase pay levels .
he added : " the bank of japan may find it more difficult now than before to hike interest rates before the end of this year . "

at the same time , other data showed average monthly household spending down by 6 % in september compared with a year ago , the biggest fall in five years .
the reports come a day after news that industrial output fell 0.7 % last month .
meanwhile , the bank of japan left its key interest rate at 0.25 % after its latest meeting .
the bank ended its zero interest rate policy in july .
the bank of japan said on tuesday it would gradually adjust monetary policy based on economic and price conditions .
analysts believe this is further indication it may raise interest rates early next year .
pay levels japan 's economy had seen a gradual revival earlier this year after a decade in the deflation doldrums .
accelerating growth , falling unemployment , and a strong economic performance had pushed japan out of a deflationary spiral , and created the confidence to finally raise interest rates .
while the rate of unemployment rose in september from the month before , the figures also showed that the total number of unemployed fell by 50,000 from a year earlier to 2.8 million .
however , analysts said the recent economic figures meant that any further rate rises were likely to be postponed until the start of 2007 .
nli research institute senior economist taro saito said the sustained fall in household spending was due to the unwillingness of japanese firms to increase pay levels .
he added : " the bank of japan may find it more difficult now than before to hike interest rates before the end of this year . "

last updated : tuesday , 31 october 2006 , 08:20 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version iran 's desperate kidney traders by nima sarvestani director , kidneys for sale on streets and in town squares in iran , young men and women can be seen holding signs offering their kidneys for sale .
the buying and selling of kidneys in iran is regulated by the state one of them reads : " immediate offer !
kidney for sale , young man , 22 , healthy , blood type o positive .
tel 09122 ... "
every year , 1,400 iranians sell one of their kidneys to a stranger .
at the tehran branch of the association of kidney patients , one of many agencies set up to facilitate the trade , the reception is full of people .
in the narrow , drab corridors , people are waiting in line , either to fill in forms , answer questions , undergo tests or be x-rayed , and finally to be operated on .
activity is intense , bordering on the chaotic .
registers are filled in , photographs of patients are pasted onto small cards , and the telephone rings endlessly .
they want it practically for free ...
they think i 'm selling meat potential kidney donor prices are inquired about and haggled over .
some people get upset at what they see as low prices and leave in anger .
one man wishes to sell because his child has been burned in a fire and he needs the cash for an urgent operation .
another wants to know why he has not received the $ 1,250 -lrb- £ 650 -rrb- he is due from the state .
a third shouts : " they want it practically for free .
they think i 'm selling meat . "
their desperation is obvious .
high expectations mehrdad is 23 years old and in deep financial trouble .
there are 137 agencies around iran and 23 transplant clinics two years ago he was working in the construction industry , had a stable income and was planning to get married .
but just after his wedding he lost his job and his attempts to find a new one were fruitless .
the debts from his wedding were still unpaid and the pile of unpaid rent bills kept growing .
desperate , he decided he would sell a kidney , hoping to receive around $ 7,500 -lrb- £ 4,000 -rrb- for it .
at the clinic mehrdad was told that the number of sellers had increased so drastically over the past year that prices had plummeted , and unfortunately for him he is blood type a , one of the most common ... driving the price even lower .
he was told the most he could expect was $ 3,700 -lrb- £ 2,000 -rrb- .
transplant deal when mehrdad returned to the clinic for his final batch of tests , he was told they had found a match for his kidney .
mehrdad decided to give his kidney to shiva on trust and accept payment after twenty-two year-old shiva had already gone through one transplant operation but her body had rejected it and it had stopped functioning after two years .
her father was still paying the debt from the first transplant .
after much haggling mehrdad and shiva settled on a fee .
the state was to pay mehrdad $ 1,250 -lrb- £ 650 -rrb- and shiva 's family had agreed to pay him another $ 3,000 -lrb- £ 1,600 -rrb- .
it was less than he had hoped , but enough to help him clear his debts .
normally the donor receives half of the money before the transplant takes place but shiva 's father kept playing for time and tried to delay the operation .
it seemed he was having trouble coming up with the cash .
vicious circle shiva -lrb- l -rrb- and mehrdad -lrb- r -rrb- became friends during their ordeal although mehrdad became frustrated and impatient to pay his debts , he and shiva spent a lot of time together at the clinic and a strong friendship blossomed between them .
mehrdad decided to give his kidney to shiva on trust and accept payment after the transplant .
he was nervous about the operation .
" the other night i dreamt i was on the operating table .
they cut open my stomach and said : ' look !
he has no kidneys ! "
two months on from the transplant , both mehrdad and shiva had made a full recovery , but mehrdad 's financial problems are far from over .
the money helped to pay off his debts and he even managed to buy a car to start a new career as a taxi driver , but he was involved in an accident and the car was written off .
unemployed once more , mehrdad reflects on everything that has happened to him .
he opens a letter shiva gave to him on their last day in hospital , in which she refers to him as her " rescuing angel " and continues : " i hope that i will care for your gift in a good way throughout my life and feel that you are with me all the time . "

the islamic finance qualification is designed to boost sharia law know-how .
islamic banking is a fast-growing area with analysts estimating that worldwide the industry is worth between £ 200bn and £ 300bn a year .
uk banks have been quick to cash in , offering mortgages , current accounts and student accounts which comply with sharia law .
under sharia islamic law , making money from money - such as charging interest - is usury and therefore not permitted . "
any organisation that is serious about catering for the growing muslim market needs to understand the detail of islamic finance " lloyds tsb spokesman wealth should be generated only through legitimate trade and investment in assets .
investment in companies involved with alcohol , gambling , tobacco and pornography is strictly off-limits .
' groundbreaking ' the new islamic finance qualification , offered by the uk securities and investment institute , is the first of its type in the world .
people will be able to take the examination at a computer terminal and will be expected to demonstrate that they understand the practical implications of sharia law on money matters .
the qualification is aimed at existing financial advisers , city workers , as well as individuals seeking a career in the sector .
lloyds tsb which was the first uk high street bank to offer islamic financial products throughout its entire branch network welcomed the new qualification as " groundbreaking " .
" any organisation that is serious about catering for the growing muslim market needs to understand the detail of islamic finance , " a lloyds tsb spokesman told bbc news .
he added that developing a " deeper understanding " of islamic finance was important in helping the city of london retain its role as a major financial hub .

security firms are reporting more and more instances of booby-trapped windows codecs - file compressors - required to play some video formats .
some of the codecs let users play types of net-based video , but also have spyware and adware wrapped inside .
others , say experts , are outright fakes that just want to infect victims with data-stealing programs .
audience ratings " everyone is watching movies on their pc , " said david robinson , uk head of security firm norman sandbox , " they are downloading the latest , greatest clips . "
while sites such as youtube and revver try to make it easy to watch video online , many of the downloadable clips posted on the web require extra software , called a codec , to play them .
mr robinson said many security firms were now logging instances in which spyware and adware firms are turning out software bundles that claim to roll together many popular codecs or just have the one needed to play a particular clip .
some of the codecs do help to play clips , but others are disguised as a variety of nuisance or malicious programs .
some rogue codecs plague users with pop-up adverts , while others invisibly install keyloggers that try to grab confidential data .
anti-spyware firm sunbelt software discovered one codec that became a program that found fictitious security problems on a pc and demanded payment to repair them .
many downloads look benign when scanned with an anti-virus program , but , once installed , download updates from other websites that contain the malicious payload .
security firms expect the popularity of clips to be exploited mr robinson said the growth of booby-trapped video codecs was just another example of how hi-tech criminals have moved on from the old days in which a virus only travelled by e-mail .
now , he said , they maintain a diverse portfolio of attack methods and will tailor these to whatever is proving popular online .
mr robinson said his company norman sandbox , which analyses captured samples of malicious code , gets hundreds of new variants of malicious programs submitted to it every day .
david emm , senior technology consultant at anti-virus firm kaspersky labs , said it was only a matter of time before virus writers turned to sites such as youtube and booby-trapped pages showing popular clips with bugs .
" youtube is almost by definition unregulated , " he said , and was ripe for exploitation by malicious hackers .
" it gives an almost endless stream of stuff to tap into . "
already spyware firms are known to be using the popularity of some clips on youtube and social networking site myspace to install their wares on the pcs of more victims .
increasing numbers of malicious attacks were pegged to news or other events , said mr emm , which helped to catch people out .

security firms are reporting more and more instances of booby-trapped windows codecs - file compressors - required to play some video formats .
some of the codecs let users play types of net-based video , but also have spyware and adware wrapped inside .
others , say experts , are outright fakes that just want to infect victims with data-stealing programs .
audience ratings " everyone is watching movies on their pc , " said david robinson , uk head of security firm norman sandbox , " they are downloading the latest , greatest clips . "
while sites such as youtube and revver try to make it easy to watch video online , many of the downloadable clips posted on the web require extra software , called a codec , to play them .
mr robinson said many security firms were now logging instances in which spyware and adware firms are turning out software bundles that claim to roll together many popular codecs or just have the one needed to play a particular clip .
some of the codecs do help to play clips , but others are disguised as a variety of nuisance or malicious programs .
some rogue codecs plague users with pop-up adverts , while others invisibly install keyloggers that try to grab confidential data .
anti-spyware firm sunbelt software discovered one codec that became a program that found fictitious security problems on a pc and demanded payment to repair them .
many downloads look benign when scanned with an anti-virus program , but , once installed , download updates from other websites that contain the malicious payload .
security firms expect the popularity of clips to be exploited mr robinson said the growth of booby-trapped video codecs was just another example of how hi-tech criminals have moved on from the old days in which a virus only travelled by e-mail .
now , he said , they maintain a diverse portfolio of attack methods and will tailor these to whatever is proving popular online .
mr robinson said his company norman sandbox , which analyses captured samples of malicious code , gets hundreds of new variants of malicious programs submitted to it every day .
david emm , senior technology consultant at anti-virus firm kaspersky labs , said it was only a matter of time before virus writers turned to sites such as youtube and booby-trapped pages showing popular clips with bugs .
" youtube is almost by definition unregulated , " he said , and was ripe for exploitation by malicious hackers .
" it gives an almost endless stream of stuff to tap into . "
already spyware firms are known to be using the popularity of some clips on youtube and social networking site myspace to install their wares on the pcs of more victims .
increasing numbers of malicious attacks were pegged to news or other events , said mr emm , which helped to catch people out .

security firms are reporting more and more instances of booby-trapped windows codecs - file compressors - required to play some video formats .
some of the codecs let users play types of net-based video , but also have spyware and adware wrapped inside .
others , say experts , are outright fakes that just want to infect victims with data-stealing programs .
audience ratings " everyone is watching movies on their pc , " said david robinson , uk head of security firm norman sandbox , " they are downloading the latest , greatest clips . "
while sites such as youtube and revver try to make it easy to watch video online , many of the downloadable clips posted on the web require extra software , called a codec , to play them .
mr robinson said many security firms were now logging instances in which spyware and adware firms are turning out software bundles that claim to roll together many popular codecs or just have the one needed to play a particular clip .
some of the codecs do help to play clips , but others are disguised as a variety of nuisance or malicious programs .
some rogue codecs plague users with pop-up adverts , while others invisibly install keyloggers that try to grab confidential data .
anti-spyware firm sunbelt software discovered one codec that became a program that found fictitious security problems on a pc and demanded payment to repair them .
many downloads look benign when scanned with an anti-virus program , but , once installed , download updates from other websites that contain the malicious payload .
mr robinson said the growth of booby-trapped video codecs was just another example of how hi-tech criminals have moved on from the old days in which a virus only travelled by e-mail .
now , he said , they maintain a diverse portfolio of attack methods and will tailor these to whatever is proving popular online .
mr robinson said his company norman sandbox , which analyses captured samples of malicious code , gets hundreds of new variants of malicious programs submitted to it every day .
david emm , senior technology consultant at anti-virus firm kaspersky labs , said it was only a matter of time before virus writers turned to sites such as youtube and booby-trapped pages showing popular clips with bugs .
" youtube is almost by definition unregulated , " he said , and was ripe for exploitation by malicious hackers .
" it gives an almost endless stream of stuff to tap into . "
already spyware firms are known to be using the popularity of some clips on youtube and social networking site myspace to install their wares on the pcs of more victims .
increasing numbers of malicious attacks were pegged to news or other events , said mr emm , which helped to catch people out .
the upcoming halloween holiday is already being exploited by malicious hackers who are baiting websites with viruses and trojans .

an $ 8bn contract was signed by the deputy transport minister and the president of the chinese firm -lrb- ccecc -rrb- .
ccecc president lin rongxin said 50,000 nigerians would work on the 1,315km line which he said was " a design , construct and maintain project " .
nigeria 's leader said the five-year north-south line was the first phase in a 20-year modernisation programme .
president olusegun obasanjo , who watched the signing , said the second phase of the railway project would include a link between the southern oil city of port harcourt and the central city of jos .
the existing railway along these routes has fallen into disrepair and new tracks are to be built under the deal with china .
china recently granted nigeria a loan of $ 2.5bn and much of this is expected to be used in the railway project .
earlier this year nigeria repaid a multi-billion dollar debt it owed to the paris club , becoming the first african nation to settle with its official lenders .
nigeria is one of the world 's biggest oil exporters , but it is also one of the world 's poorest countries , with the majority of the population living on less than $ 1 per day .

what is the current row over faith schools ?
the government has denied caving in to religious leaders by suddenly dropping a plan to force faith schools to take a quarter of their pupils from other backgrounds .
former education secretary lord -lrb- kenneth -rrb- baker proposed a 25 % quota for faith schools as part of a current bill .
education secretary alan johnson signed up to the idea but then dropped it .
he said a voluntary agreement with both church of england and catholic state-funded schools made it unnecessary .
lord baker did n't take that down .
he tabled an amendment in the house of lords to reintroduce the proposal .
lord baker 's plan was defeated .
instead , peers backed a government proposal to allow ofsted , the schools watchdog , to monitor how well schools are doing at promoting " community cohesion " - jargon for how much contact they build with different groups or schools in their wider communities .
how would the quota have worked ?
lord baker said he believed faith schools were separating children at the ages of five and 11 rather than helping them to integrate with each other in an increasingly diverse society .
" we 've only got the example in northern ireland to see where that leads , " he said .
he was primarily concerned about muslim state schools , saying he could not see how these children would be effectively integrated if they did not come into contact with children from other backgrounds .
the government agreed and proposed a quota for all new faith schools .
why was the proposal dropped ?
alan johnson says he has now struck a deal with both churches , the key players , under which they will accept voluntary local arrangements .
england 's faith schools church of england 4,646 roman catholic 2,041 jewish 37 muslim 9 -lrb- expected -rrb- sikh 2 hindu 1 -lrb- expected -rrb- however , the deal is unclear .
in his letter to the catholic education service , which had spearheaded the protests , mr johnson said it was not his intention to prevent schools meeting the demand for places from parents of that religious background .
critically , any demand for places from other families " would be in addition to the demand for faith places " and subject to local circumstances and public consultation .
the catholic education service says the government needs to make clear who exactly would be funding these theoretical extra places - a position supported by other faith groups .
why did faiths oppose the plan ?
faith groups historically are wary of government interference , even though they are part of the state system .
but the crucial factor for all the groups was a fear that if they were forced to take in children from other backgrounds , they would be unable to serve the needs of their own communities .
how many faith schools are there in the uk ?
there are approximately 7,000 such schools in england , the vast majority being christian .
the next largest group is jewish .
policy climbdown ?
any requirement to provide non-faith places , where local circumstances make it appropriate and subject to public consultation , would be in addition to the demand for faith places read alan johnson 's letter in full -lrb- pdf file -rrb- most computers will open pdfs , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .

the association of muslim schools -lrb- ams -rrb- says there will soon be nine state muslim schools .
there are some 140 other muslim schools in the uk but most are so small they are unlikely to become part of the state system .
the ams hopes to see 30 large muslim schools transfer to the state system in the near future .
had the proposed quota become legally enforceable , muslim schools would have been the most affected .
harrow in west london will be home to the first hindu state school in the country following a successful bid for government funding .
is this a new debate ?
not at all .
there have been significant political , social and educational divisions over faith schools for decades .
the critical issue at the heart of the debate is whether they aid or hinder the building of a cohesive society .
prime minister tony blair loudly supports faith schools .
and despite question marks over integration , the government 's much-trumpeted commission on integration and cohesion has been told faith schools are out of bounds .
critically , government policy is to encourage the development of faith groups , regarding them as a useful tool in building stronger communities in a multicultural society .
demand for places tends to be high .
but there are also dissenting voices in all communities , including jews and muslims who regard faith schools as bad for the passage of their children into wider british society .

the government has denied caving in to religious leaders by suddenly dropping a plan to force faith schools to take a quarter of their pupils from other backgrounds .
former education secretary lord -lrb- kenneth -rrb- baker proposed a 25 % quota for faith schools as part of a current bill .
education secretary alan johnson signed up to the idea but then dropped it .
he said a voluntary agreement with both church of england and catholic state-funded schools made it unnecessary .
lord baker did n't take that down .
he tabled an amendment in the house of lords to reintroduce the proposal .
lord baker 's plan was defeated .
instead , peers backed a government proposal to allow ofsted , the schools watchdog , to monitor how well schools are doing at promoting " community cohesion " - jargon for how much contact they build with different groups or schools in their wider communities .
how would the quota have worked ?
lord baker said he believed faith schools were separating children at the ages of five and 11 rather than helping them to integrate with each other in an increasingly diverse society .
" we 've only got the example in northern ireland to see where that leads , " he said .
he was primarily concerned about muslim state schools , saying he could not see how these children would be effectively integrated if they did not come into contact with children from other backgrounds .
the government agreed and proposed a quota for all new faith schools .
why was the proposal dropped ?

how would the quota have worked ?
lord baker said he believed faith schools were separating children at the ages of five and 11 rather than helping them to integrate with each other in an increasingly diverse society .
" we 've only got the example in northern ireland to see where that leads , " he said .
he was primarily concerned about muslim state schools , saying he could not see how these children would be effectively integrated if they did not come into contact with children from other backgrounds .
the government agreed and proposed a quota for all new faith schools .
why was the proposal dropped ?
alan johnson says he has now struck a deal with both churches , the key players , under which they will accept voluntary local arrangements .
england 's faith schools church of england 4,646 roman catholic 2,041 jewish 37 muslim 9 -lrb- expected -rrb- sikh 2 hindu 1 -lrb- expected -rrb- however , the deal is unclear .
in his letter to the catholic education service , which had spearheaded the protests , mr johnson said it was not his intention to prevent schools meeting the demand for places from parents of that religious background .
critically , any demand for places from other families " would be in addition to the demand for faith places " and subject to local circumstances and public consultation .
the catholic education service says the government needs to make clear who exactly would be funding these theoretical extra places - a position supported by other faith groups .
why did faiths oppose the plan ?
faith groups historically are wary of government interference , even though they are part of the state system .
but the crucial factor for all the groups was a fear that if they were forced to take in children from other backgrounds , they would be unable to serve the needs of their own communities .
how many faith schools are there in the uk ?
there are approximately 7,000 such schools in england , the vast majority being christian .
the next largest group is jewish .
policy climbdown ? "
any requirement to provide non-faith places , where local circumstances make it appropriate and subject to public consultation , would be in addition to the demand for faith places " most computers will open pdfs , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
there are two sikh schools but the area of growth is in islamic communities .
the association of muslim schools -lrb- ams -rrb- says there will soon be nine state muslim schools .
there are some 140 other muslim schools in the uk but most are so small they are unlikely to become part of the state system .
the ams hopes to see 30 large muslim schools transfer to the state system in the near future .
had the proposed quota become legally enforceable , muslim schools would have been the most affected .
harrow in west london will be home to the first hindu state school in the country following a successful bid for government funding .
is this a new debate ?
not at all .
there have been significant political , social and educational divisions over faith schools for decades .
the critical issue at the heart of the debate is whether they aid or hinder the building of a cohesive society .
prime minister tony blair loudly supports faith schools .
and despite question marks over integration , the government 's much-trumpeted commission on integration and cohesion has been told faith schools are out of bounds .
critically , government policy is to encourage the development of faith groups , regarding them as a useful tool in building stronger communities in a multicultural society .
demand for places tends to be high .
but there are also dissenting voices in all communities , including jews and muslims who regard faith schools as bad for the passage of their children into wider british society .
