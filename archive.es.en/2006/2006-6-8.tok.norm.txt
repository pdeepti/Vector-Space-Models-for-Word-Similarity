and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .
he told spiegel-online , " we 're the pioneers yet again .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .

but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .
he told spiegel-online , " we 're the pioneers yet again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .
his forthcomi n g book , co-authored with aleksa n dr furse n ko , is called " kruschev 's war : the i n side story of a n america n adversary . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia suppressed information about nazi fugitive newly released cia documents show that the us kept mum about adolf eichmann 's whereabouts to protect a high-ranking german official with a dubious past .

here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?

here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .

the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .

anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .

the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .

if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

" security concerns abused many think the reclamation of the sport must start at the fan base .

for edff coordinator , peter schüngel , projects like these are necessary as a counterweight to commercialization , which he thinks has played a key role in fueling aggression between fans from other cities and countries . " wherever money is being made , it 's a law of nature that security will be optimized so that the process can continue , " the 54-year-old said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much security can actually cause tensions to boil over he is careful to add that when he makes such comments to the press , he does n't intend to sound like a leftist railing against capitalism .

it 's no longer about which team wins on the field .
the bonds between players and supporters have taken a back seat to the bottom line of wealthy owners , many of whom do n't come from the club 's city or even country .

we made it our goal to give the fans a voice , " said the magazine 's editor-in-chief , philipp köster . the 34-year-old pointed out that 11 freunde openly supports groups like baff without going as far as being a mouthpiece for them .

fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 .

" brazil will win the world cup , i hope we make it to the finals and at least finish second , " she said . and fabricio otarola from costa rica said he has never seen an event as big as this ceremony . " it 's amazing and really nice , " he said , adding that if berlin 's opening party was an indication of what was still to come , it would turn out to be a " really great " world cup .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .

fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 . " it 's beautiful , it 's a very well-organized event , " he said .
some fans were not paying much attention to what was happening on stage as they continued singing and dancing to their own songs throughout the night . few match tickets but robledo muccer from porto alegre , brazil , complained about the limited number of tickets that were available . " i am only here in germany for one match because i only managed get one ticket , " he said , adding that he would have loved to watch more games . muccer was not the only one - there was a large number of fans who also complained about failing to secure more than one ticket to their team 's world cup matches .

" poland will win the 2006 world cup , " they told everyone they met . ecuadorian paulina vasquez who has been in berlin for a month already , was more realistic about her country 's chances in the competition . " brazil will win the world cup , i hope we make it to the finals and at least finish second , " she said . and fabricio otarola from costa rica said he has never seen an event as big as this ceremony . " it 's amazing and really nice , " he said , adding that if berlin 's opening party was an indication of what was still to come , it would turn out to be a " really great " world cup .

iran said it saw some positive aspects , although there were some " ambiguities . " " this is an offer to kick off negotiations but there must first be a suspension of -lrb- enrichment -rrb- activities implemented by iran , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters before a meeting with solana , who was in berlin . " it is a broad and comprehensive offer .
i believe it is a huge chance and i hope that we 'll do a bit of negotiating . " the proposals , which have not been made public but include incentives and penalties , seek to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program , which many countries fear will be used to build atomic bombs .
tehran insists that its nuclear aims are purely peaceful . solana said in an interview to appear in thursday 's tagespiegel newspaper that what iran had received were " elements of a proposal which are the basis for later negotiations . " " the package enables iran to have civilian nuclear energy and access to technology , and it offers economic incentives , above all in the energy sector , " the paper quoted solana as saying . " significant chance " merkel urged the iranians to consider the offer seriously , saying this was an opportunity to secure a peaceful resolution to the long nuclear standoff between iran and the west . " i believe that it is a truly significant chance to resolve this conflict diplomatically , " she said .
" and everyone should be aware of his responsibility in this context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in tehran on tuesday iranian officials said the incentives included access to aircraft parts needed to renovate its ageing civilian fleet and the chance to purchase u.s. agricultural technology . eu diplomats have said the package includes an offer of light-water nuclear reactors and security guarantees .

instead , europeans and russians would be the prime contractors . cautious optimism on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he was encouraged by iran 's initial response although he remained cautious . " it sounds like a positive step to me , " bush said in laredo , texas .
" i have said the united states will come and sit down at the table with them as long as they 're willing to suspend their enrichment in a verifiable way .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .

for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling . for the better part of two years , over 80 million germans have been literally bombarded by an advertising blitz that has reached epic proportions .
it would be almost impossible for someone living in the country not to have heard about the world cup . tournament sponsors know this and have sent out an interminable advertising barrage .
mcdonalds and coca-cola aim at armchair coaches ; adidas at potential stars on the pitch ; mastercard at the cash strapped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be it sweet or sweaty , it has to be associated with the world cup the commercialization of the world 's most-watched sporting event , and soccer in general , over the past decade and a half has led to a counter reaction amongst fans . initiatives , demonstrations , and magazines have taken aim at functionaries like fifa president sepp blatter or germany world cup organizer franz beckenbauer , and are calling on fans to " reclaim the game . " security concerns abused many think the reclamation of the sport must start at the fan base .
since violence off the pitch often gains as much attention as the final score on it , fears that hooliganism may scar " the beautiful game " have led to security measures some feel are excessive , preventing fans from even making contact with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody needs a shoulder to lean on - and a bed to sleep in the project " ein dach für fans " -lrb- edff -rrb- , or " one roof for fans , " was founded in dortmund in 2004 to " provide friendly , people-uniting contacts between german and soccer fans from around the world " .
for edff coordinator , peter schüngel , projects like these are necessary as a counterweight to commercialization , which he thinks has played a key role in fueling aggression between fans from other cities and countries . " wherever money is being made , it 's a law of nature that security will be optimized so that the process can continue , " the 54-year-old said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much security can actually cause tensions to boil over he is careful to add that when he makes such comments to the press , he does n't intend to sound like a leftist railing against capitalism .
schüngel admitted that soccer has profited immensely from commercialization , but he said there are limits as to how far security should extend to protect it . " the separation of fans leads to xenophobia .
with the roof project , we bring supporters together .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .

the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .

the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .

that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .

the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is . " positive sig n als from tehera n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz nuclear power is located 270 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south of tehran the iaea has called on tehran , most recently in february , to suspend all uranium enrichment activities .
the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works . " an influential member of the national security committee , rashid jalali jafari , said iran welcomes negotiations but reserves its national rights . " we should accept negotiations , but on the condition that the europeans do not sabotage our national interests , " he told the semi-official news agency mehr . top national security official ali larijani has said the proposals contain " positive steps " but also " ambiguities " - signaling no immediate decision from tehran was likely . no more sa n ctio n s for tehera n ? diplomats say the united states has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if tehran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington has also agreed to join multilateral talks with iran if it suspends its uranium-enrichment actavities , offering the prospect of the first substantive talks between the two arch-enemies for 26 years . diplomats said that if iran negotiations go well , enrichment on iranian soil could be possible - but that such a situation is years away . " it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .
his forthcomi n g book , co-authored with aleksa n dr furse n ko , is called " kruschev 's war : the i n side story of a n america n adversary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

it would be almost impossible for someone living in the country not to have heard about the world cup . tournament sponsors know this and have sent out an interminable advertising barrage .
mcdonalds and coca-cola aim at armchair coaches ; adidas at potential stars on the pitch ; mastercard at the cash strapped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be it sweet or sweaty , it has to be associated with the world cup the commercialization of the world 's most-watched sporting event , and soccer in general , over the past decade and a half has led to a counter reaction amongst fans . initiatives , demonstrations , and magazines have taken aim at functionaries like fifa president sepp blatter or germany world cup organizer franz beckenbauer , and are calling on fans to " reclaim the game . " security concerns abused many think the reclamation of the sport must start at the fan base .
since violence off the pitch often gains as much attention as the final score on it , fears that hooliganism may scar " the beautiful game " have led to security measures some feel are excessive , preventing fans from even making contact with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody needs a shoulder to lean on - and a bed to sleep in the project " ein dach für fans " -lrb- edff -rrb- , or " one roof for fans , " was founded in dortmund in 2004 to " provide friendly , people-uniting contacts between german and soccer fans from around the world " .
for edff coordinator , peter schüngel , projects like these are necessary as a counterweight to commercialization , which he thinks has played a key role in fueling aggression between fans from other cities and countries . " wherever money is being made , it 's a law of nature that security will be optimized so that the process can continue , " the 54-year-old said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much security can actually cause tensions to boil over he is careful to add that when he makes such comments to the press , he does n't intend to sound like a leftist railing against capitalism .
schüngel admitted that soccer has profited immensely from commercialization , but he said there are limits as to how far security should extend to protect it . " the separation of fans leads to xenophobia .
with the roof project , we bring supporters together .
i ca n't but recall a saying from an englishman about soccer fans : ' we 're friends and rivals in a common affair ' , " he said . " eat the rich " the heads of the alliance of active football fans -lrb- baff -rrb- have minced no words in expressing their distaste for the overkill of corporate sponsorship at the world cup .
on their web site , baff turned the world cup mascot - the oversized , cuddly , but unloved lion goleo - into prolleo , a beer-guzzling , teeth-baring lion , escorted by a bottle of lager . prolleo 's raison d 'etre can be read on the back of his blue jeans vest : " eat the rich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo may be sweet , but for baff the lion symbolizes cold commercialization it is exactly money , or to be more specific , the need of supporters to have lots of money to view soccer matches , that drives baff .
vip areas , the world cup ticket lottery , and the privileges of sponsors have created a gap that leaves the " poor " fan standing on the outside , looking in . giving fans a voice the media hype regarding the world cup and the sport overall has left many a soccer supporter alienated .
it 's no longer about which team wins on the field .
the bonds between players and supporters have taken a back seat to the bottom line of wealthy owners , many of whom do n't come from the club 's city or even country .
russian tycoon roman abramovich , owner of london 's chelsea , or american billionaire malcolm glazer , who owns manchester united , are prime examples . the german soccer magazine 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- was born as a result of this fan-team deficit at the turn of the millennium . " i think the big problem at that time was that there was no publication where people could raise their voice against the commercialization of the sport .
we made it our goal to give the fans a voice , " said the magazine 's editor-in-chief , philipp köster . the 34-year-old pointed out that 11 freunde openly supports groups like baff without going as far as being a mouthpiece for them .
as a businessman trying to turn a profit , he knows 11 freunde walks a thin line between being called hypocritical if too many ads appear , and the alternative - closing up shop . for his publication , the world cup will be a chance to focus on the events that are n't in the spotlight .
the fans have been " worn down " by what köster called a " spectacle of commerce . "

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?

the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity .

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is . " positive sig n als from tehera n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz nuclear power is located 270 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south of tehran the iaea has called on tehran , most recently in february , to suspend all uranium enrichment activities .
the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works . " an influential member of the national security committee , rashid jalali jafari , said iran welcomes negotiations but reserves its national rights . " we should accept negotiations , but on the condition that the europeans do not sabotage our national interests , " he told the semi-official news agency mehr . top national security official ali larijani has said the proposals contain " positive steps " but also " ambiguities " - signaling no immediate decision from tehran was likely . no more sa n ctio n s for tehera n ? diplomats say the united states has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if tehran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington has also agreed to join multilateral talks with iran if it suspends its uranium-enrichment actavities , offering the prospect of the first substantive talks between the two arch-enemies for 26 years . diplomats said that if iran negotiations go well , enrichment on iranian soil could be possible - but that such a situation is years away . " it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .
his forthcomi n g book , co-authored with aleksa n dr furse n ko , is called " kruschev 's war : the i n side story of a n america n adversary .

for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling . for the better part of two years , over 80 million germans have been literally bombarded by an advertising blitz that has reached epic proportions .
it would be almost impossible for someone living in the country not to have heard about the world cup . tournament sponsors know this and have sent out an interminable advertising barrage .
mcdonalds and coca-cola aim at armchair coaches ; adidas at potential stars on the pitch ; mastercard at the cash strapped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be it sweet or sweaty , it has to be associated with the world cup the commercialization of the world 's most-watched sporting event , and soccer in general , over the past decade and a half has led to a counter reaction amongst fans . initiatives , demonstrations , and magazines have taken aim at functionaries like fifa president sepp blatter or germany world cup organizer franz beckenbauer , and are calling on fans to " reclaim the game . " security concerns abused many think the reclamation of the sport must start at the fan base .
since violence off the pitch often gains as much attention as the final score on it , fears that hooliganism may scar " the beautiful game " have led to security measures some feel are excessive , preventing fans from even making contact with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody needs a shoulder to lean on - and a bed to sleep in the project " ein dach für fans " -lrb- edff -rrb- , or " one roof for fans , " was founded in dortmund in 2004 to " provide friendly , people-uniting contacts between german and soccer fans from around the world " .
for edff coordinator , peter schüngel , projects like these are necessary as a counterweight to commercialization , which he thinks has played a key role in fueling aggression between fans from other cities and countries . " wherever money is being made , it 's a law of nature that security will be optimized so that the process can continue , " the 54-year-old said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much security can actually cause tensions to boil over he is careful to add that when he makes such comments to the press , he does n't intend to sound like a leftist railing against capitalism .
schüngel admitted that soccer has profited immensely from commercialization , but he said there are limits as to how far security should extend to protect it . " the separation of fans leads to xenophobia .
with the roof project , we bring supporters together .
i ca n't but recall a saying from an englishman about soccer fans : ' we 're friends and rivals in a common affair ' , " he said . " eat the rich " the heads of the alliance of active football fans -lrb- baff -rrb- have minced no words in expressing their distaste for the overkill of corporate sponsorship at the world cup .
on their web site , baff turned the world cup mascot - the oversized , cuddly , but unloved lion goleo - into prolleo , a beer-guzzling , teeth-baring lion , escorted by a bottle of lager . prolleo 's raison d 'etre can be read on the back of his blue jeans vest : " eat the rich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo may be sweet , but for baff the lion symbolizes cold commercialization it is exactly money , or to be more specific , the need of supporters to have lots of money to view soccer matches , that drives baff .
vip areas , the world cup ticket lottery , and the privileges of sponsors have created a gap that leaves the " poor " fan standing on the outside , looking in . giving fans a voice the media hype regarding the world cup and the sport overall has left many a soccer supporter alienated .
it 's no longer about which team wins on the field .
the bonds between players and supporters have taken a back seat to the bottom line of wealthy owners , many of whom do n't come from the club 's city or even country .
russian tycoon roman abramovich , owner of london 's chelsea , or american billionaire malcolm glazer , who owns manchester united , are prime examples . the german soccer magazine 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- was born as a result of this fan-team deficit at the turn of the millennium . " i think the big problem at that time was that there was no publication where people could raise their voice against the commercialization of the sport .
we made it our goal to give the fans a voice , " said the magazine 's editor-in-chief , philipp köster . the 34-year-old pointed out that 11 freunde openly supports groups like baff without going as far as being a mouthpiece for them .
as a businessman trying to turn a profit , he knows 11 freunde walks a thin line between being called hypocritical if too many ads appear , and the alternative - closing up shop . for his publication , the world cup will be a chance to focus on the events that are n't in the spotlight .
the fans have been " worn down " by what köster called a " spectacle of commerce . "

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is . " positive sig n als from tehera n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz nuclear power is located 270 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south of tehran the iaea has called on tehran , most recently in february , to suspend all uranium enrichment activities .
the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works . " an influential member of the national security committee , rashid jalali jafari , said iran welcomes negotiations but reserves its national rights . " we should accept negotiations , but on the condition that the europeans do not sabotage our national interests , " he told the semi-official news agency mehr . top national security official ali larijani has said the proposals contain " positive steps " but also " ambiguities " - signaling no immediate decision from tehran was likely . no more sa n ctio n s for tehera n ? diplomats say the united states has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if tehran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington has also agreed to join multilateral talks with iran if it suspends its uranium-enrichment actavities , offering the prospect of the first substantive talks between the two arch-enemies for 26 years . diplomats said that if iran negotiations go well , enrichment on iranian soil could be possible - but that such a situation is years away . " it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .
it said the west would be ready to negotiate on other terms of the offer .

" it is a broad and comprehensive offer .
i believe it is a huge chance and i hope that we 'll do a bit of negotiating . " the proposals , which have not been made public but include incentives and penalties , seek to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program , which many countries fear will be used to build atomic bombs .
tehran insists that its nuclear aims are purely peaceful . solana said in an interview to appear in thursday 's tagespiegel newspaper that what iran had received were " elements of a proposal which are the basis for later negotiations . " " the package enables iran to have civilian nuclear energy and access to technology , and it offers economic incentives , above all in the energy sector , " the paper quoted solana as saying . " significant chance " merkel urged the iranians to consider the offer seriously , saying this was an opportunity to secure a peaceful resolution to the long nuclear standoff between iran and the west .

" and everyone should be aware of his responsibility in this context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in tehran on tuesday iranian officials said the incentives included access to aircraft parts needed to renovate its ageing civilian fleet and the chance to purchase u.s. agricultural technology . eu diplomats have said the package includes an offer of light-water nuclear reactors and security guarantees .

instead , europeans and russians would be the prime contractors . cautious optimism on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he was encouraged by iran 's initial response although he remained cautious . " it sounds like a positive step to me , " bush said in laredo , texas .
" i have said the united states will come and sit down at the table with them as long as they 're willing to suspend their enrichment in a verifiable way .

iran said it saw some positive aspects , although there were some " ambiguities . " " this is an offer to kick off negotiations but there must first be a suspension of -lrb- enrichment -rrb- activities implemented by iran , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters before a meeting with solana , who was in berlin . " it is a broad and comprehensive offer .
i believe it is a huge chance and i hope that we 'll do a bit of negotiating . " the proposals , which have not been made public but include incentives and penalties , seek to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program , which many countries fear will be used to build atomic bombs .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .

" germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .
he told spiegel-online , " we 're the pioneers yet again .

the bonds between players and supporters have taken a back seat to the bottom line of wealthy owners , many of whom do n't come from the club 's city or even country .
russian tycoon roman abramovich , owner of london 's chelsea , or american billionaire malcolm glazer , who owns manchester united , are prime examples . the german soccer magazine 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- was born as a result of this fan-team deficit at the turn of the millennium . " i think the big problem at that time was that there was no publication where people could raise their voice against the commercialization of the sport .
we made it our goal to give the fans a voice , " said the magazine 's editor-in-chief , philipp köster . the 34-year-old pointed out that 11 freunde openly supports groups like baff without going as far as being a mouthpiece for them .
as a businessman trying to turn a profit , he knows 11 freunde walks a thin line between being called hypocritical if too many ads appear , and the alternative - closing up shop . for his publication , the world cup will be a chance to focus on the events that are n't in the spotlight .
the fans have been " worn down " by what köster called a " spectacle of commerce . "

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .

unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?

for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling . for the better part of two years , over 80 million germans have been literally bombarded by an advertising blitz that has reached epic proportions .
it would be almost impossible for someone living in the country not to have heard about the world cup . tournament sponsors know this and have sent out an interminable advertising barrage .
mcdonalds and coca-cola aim at armchair coaches ; adidas at potential stars on the pitch ; mastercard at the cash strapped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be it sweet or sweaty , it has to be associated with the world cup the commercialization of the world 's most-watched sporting event , and soccer in general , over the past decade and a half has led to a counter reaction amongst fans . initiatives , demonstrations , and magazines have taken aim at functionaries like fifa president sepp blatter or germany world cup organizer franz beckenbauer , and are calling on fans to " reclaim the game . " security concerns abused many think the reclamation of the sport must start at the fan base .
since violence off the pitch often gains as much attention as the final score on it , fears that hooliganism may scar " the beautiful game " have led to security measures some feel are excessive , preventing fans from even making contact with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody needs a shoulder to lean on - and a bed to sleep in the project " ein dach für fans " -lrb- edff -rrb- , or " one roof for fans , " was founded in dortmund in 2004 to " provide friendly , people-uniting contacts between german and soccer fans from around the world " .
for edff coordinator , peter schüngel , projects like these are necessary as a counterweight to commercialization , which he thinks has played a key role in fueling aggression between fans from other cities and countries . " wherever money is being made , it 's a law of nature that security will be optimized so that the process can continue , " the 54-year-old said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much security can actually cause tensions to boil over he is careful to add that when he makes such comments to the press , he does n't intend to sound like a leftist railing against capitalism .
schüngel admitted that soccer has profited immensely from commercialization , but he said there are limits as to how far security should extend to protect it . " the separation of fans leads to xenophobia .
with the roof project , we bring supporters together .
i ca n't but recall a saying from an englishman about soccer fans : ' we 're friends and rivals in a common affair ' , " he said . " eat the rich " the heads of the alliance of active football fans -lrb- baff -rrb- have minced no words in expressing their distaste for the overkill of corporate sponsorship at the world cup .
on their web site , baff turned the world cup mascot - the oversized , cuddly , but unloved lion goleo - into prolleo , a beer-guzzling , teeth-baring lion , escorted by a bottle of lager . prolleo 's raison d 'etre can be read on the back of his blue jeans vest : " eat the rich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo may be sweet , but for baff the lion symbolizes cold commercialization it is exactly money , or to be more specific , the need of supporters to have lots of money to view soccer matches , that drives baff .
vip areas , the world cup ticket lottery , and the privileges of sponsors have created a gap that leaves the " poor " fan standing on the outside , looking in . giving fans a voice the media hype regarding the world cup and the sport overall has left many a soccer supporter alienated .
it 's no longer about which team wins on the field .
the bonds between players and supporters have taken a back seat to the bottom line of wealthy owners , many of whom do n't come from the club 's city or even country .
russian tycoon roman abramovich , owner of london 's chelsea , or american billionaire malcolm glazer , who owns manchester united , are prime examples . the german soccer magazine 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- was born as a result of this fan-team deficit at the turn of the millennium . " i think the big problem at that time was that there was no publication where people could raise their voice against the commercialization of the sport .
we made it our goal to give the fans a voice , " said the magazine 's editor-in-chief , philipp köster . the 34-year-old pointed out that 11 freunde openly supports groups like baff without going as far as being a mouthpiece for them .
as a businessman trying to turn a profit , he knows 11 freunde walks a thin line between being called hypocritical if too many ads appear , and the alternative - closing up shop . for his publication , the world cup will be a chance to focus on the events that are n't in the spotlight .
the fans have been " worn down " by what köster called a " spectacle of commerce . "
what everybody most wants now is for the games simply to begin . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving shelter to soccer fans instead of sending soccer fans to the family tree to look for long-lost german relatives with a free room , a number of internet sites are connecting fans to thousands of empty guest beds and extra sofas in german homes .
-lrb- june 3 , 2006 -rrb- eleven friends and their love of soccer for the past five years , a scrappy fan-focused soccer magazine has been winning hearts in germany .
a year before the world cup , " 11 freunde " is the resounding fan favorite - and publishers are starting to notice .

he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

it said the west would be ready to negotiate on other terms of the offer . european union foreign policy chief javier solana delivered the offer to tehran on tuesday , with a delegation of senior officials from the " eu3 " - france , britain and germany - and from russia .
iran said it saw some positive aspects , although there were some " ambiguities . " " this is an offer to kick off negotiations but there must first be a suspension of -lrb- enrichment -rrb- activities implemented by iran , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters before a meeting with solana , who was in berlin . " it is a broad and comprehensive offer .
i believe it is a huge chance and i hope that we 'll do a bit of negotiating . " the proposals , which have not been made public but include incentives and penalties , seek to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program , which many countries fear will be used to build atomic bombs .
tehran insists that its nuclear aims are purely peaceful . solana said in an interview to appear in thursday 's tagespiegel newspaper that what iran had received were " elements of a proposal which are the basis for later negotiations . " " the package enables iran to have civilian nuclear energy and access to technology , and it offers economic incentives , above all in the energy sector , " the paper quoted solana as saying . " significant chance " merkel urged the iranians to consider the offer seriously , saying this was an opportunity to secure a peaceful resolution to the long nuclear standoff between iran and the west . " i believe that it is a truly significant chance to resolve this conflict diplomatically , " she said .
" and everyone should be aware of his responsibility in this context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in tehran on tuesday iranian officials said the incentives included access to aircraft parts needed to renovate its ageing civilian fleet and the chance to purchase u.s. agricultural technology . eu diplomats have said the package includes an offer of light-water nuclear reactors and security guarantees .
western diplomats said the us was not expected to provide nuclear technology or equipment directly to iran .
instead , europeans and russians would be the prime contractors . cautious optimism on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he was encouraged by iran 's initial response although he remained cautious . " it sounds like a positive step to me , " bush said in laredo , texas .
" i have said the united states will come and sit down at the table with them as long as they 're willing to suspend their enrichment in a verifiable way . " but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned against too much optimism and said he expected a decision from iran by the time the group of eight foreign ministers meet in moscow at the end of june . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran gives cautious reception to nuclear offer iran on tuesday gave a cautious reception to an international proposal aimed at resolving the crisis over its disputed nuclear drive , saying the offer contains " positive steps " but also " ambiguities .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 . " it 's beautiful , it 's a very well-organized event , " he said .
some fans were not paying much attention to what was happening on stage as they continued singing and dancing to their own songs throughout the night . few match tickets but robledo muccer from porto alegre , brazil , complained about the limited number of tickets that were available . " i am only here in germany for one match because i only managed get one ticket , " he said , adding that he would have loved to watch more games . muccer was not the only one - there was a large number of fans who also complained about failing to secure more than one ticket to their team 's world cup matches .
most said they will be in berlin for the duration of the world cup and will watch other games at the public viewing camps , some of which carry up to 10,000 fans . ambitious fa n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from different walks of life but together for the world cup in berlin some fans took the opportunity to show their ambitions as they bragged that their teams were better prepared and ready to lift the world cup . polish friends wojciech szpata and maciy zurawik , from jelenia gora , poland , clad in their country 's colors , were among the ambitious ones . " poland will win the 2006 world cup , " they told everyone they met . ecuadorian paulina vasquez who has been in berlin for a month already , was more realistic about her country 's chances in the competition . " brazil will win the world cup , i hope we make it to the finals and at least finish second , " she said . and fabricio otarola from costa rica said he has never seen an event as big as this ceremony . " it 's amazing and really nice , " he said , adding that if berlin 's opening party was an indication of what was still to come , it would turn out to be a " really great " world cup .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

i believe it is a huge chance and i hope that we 'll do a bit of negotiating . " the proposals , which have not been made public but include incentives and penalties , seek to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program , which many countries fear will be used to build atomic bombs .
tehran insists that its nuclear aims are purely peaceful . solana said in an interview to appear in thursday 's tagespiegel newspaper that what iran had received were " elements of a proposal which are the basis for later negotiations . " " the package enables iran to have civilian nuclear energy and access to technology , and it offers economic incentives , above all in the energy sector , " the paper quoted solana as saying .

instead , europeans and russians would be the prime contractors . cautious optimism on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he was encouraged by iran 's initial response although he remained cautious . " it sounds like a positive step to me , " bush said in laredo , texas .
" i have said the united states will come and sit down at the table with them as long as they 're willing to suspend their enrichment in a verifiable way .

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use .

"
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .

" it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .

the so-called " fan mile " area , which has been set up along a major boulevard to the west of the gate , came to a stand-still as fans came in droves and took the opportunity to bond in true world cup spirit . large scree n displays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting into the world cup spirit at the brandenburger tor most relied on the large screen displays to witness what was happening as not everyone could catch a glimpse of the stage .
there were huge roars of appreciation from the fans when pictures of previous world cup heroes , such as argentina 's diego maradona , brazil 's pele and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , were shown .
fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 . " it 's beautiful , it 's a very well-organized event , " he said .
some fans were not paying much attention to what was happening on stage as they continued singing and dancing to their own songs throughout the night . few match tickets but robledo muccer from porto alegre , brazil , complained about the limited number of tickets that were available . " i am only here in germany for one match because i only managed get one ticket , " he said , adding that he would have loved to watch more games . muccer was not the only one - there was a large number of fans who also complained about failing to secure more than one ticket to their team 's world cup matches .

" poland will win the 2006 world cup , " they told everyone they met . ecuadorian paulina vasquez who has been in berlin for a month already , was more realistic about her country 's chances in the competition . " brazil will win the world cup , i hope we make it to the finals and at least finish second , " she said . and fabricio otarola from costa rica said he has never seen an event as big as this ceremony . " it 's amazing and really nice , " he said , adding that if berlin 's opening party was an indication of what was still to come , it would turn out to be a " really great " world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2006 eu says it will help palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is promising to push for millions in aid the eu is trying to create a special aid fund for palestinians that would bypass the hamas-led palestinian government . the eu is considering aid worth $ 42 million -lrb- 34 million euros -rrb- per month for palestinians that would pay some workers directly and bypass the hamas government . the proposal , as reported by reuters , still needs approval by the quartet of middle east mediators - the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations . foreign policy chief javier solana said this week that the eu would not abandon the palestinians and hoped that the special aid fund would be in place by early next month . " the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah .
" the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 . " avoidi n g fi n a n cial meltdow n the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues .
that is because hamas has refused to recognize israel , renounce violence or honor the peace agreements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana hopes the aid will be delivered by july to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government .

it said the west would be ready to negotiate on other terms of the offer . european union foreign policy chief javier solana delivered the offer to tehran on tuesday , with a delegation of senior officials from the " eu3 " - france , britain and germany - and from russia .
iran said it saw some positive aspects , although there were some " ambiguities . " " this is an offer to kick off negotiations but there must first be a suspension of -lrb- enrichment -rrb- activities implemented by iran , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters before a meeting with solana , who was in berlin . " it is a broad and comprehensive offer .
i believe it is a huge chance and i hope that we 'll do a bit of negotiating . " the proposals , which have not been made public but include incentives and penalties , seek to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program , which many countries fear will be used to build atomic bombs .
tehran insists that its nuclear aims are purely peaceful . solana said in an interview to appear in thursday 's tagespiegel newspaper that what iran had received were " elements of a proposal which are the basis for later negotiations . " " the package enables iran to have civilian nuclear energy and access to technology , and it offers economic incentives , above all in the energy sector , " the paper quoted solana as saying . " significant chance " merkel urged the iranians to consider the offer seriously , saying this was an opportunity to secure a peaceful resolution to the long nuclear standoff between iran and the west . " i believe that it is a truly significant chance to resolve this conflict diplomatically , " she said .
" and everyone should be aware of his responsibility in this context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in tehran on tuesday iranian officials said the incentives included access to aircraft parts needed to renovate its ageing civilian fleet and the chance to purchase u.s. agricultural technology . eu diplomats have said the package includes an offer of light-water nuclear reactors and security guarantees .
western diplomats said the us was not expected to provide nuclear technology or equipment directly to iran .
instead , europeans and russians would be the prime contractors . cautious optimism on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he was encouraged by iran 's initial response although he remained cautious . " it sounds like a positive step to me , " bush said in laredo , texas .
" i have said the united states will come and sit down at the table with them as long as they 're willing to suspend their enrichment in a verifiable way . " but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned against too much optimism and said he expected a decision from iran by the time the group of eight foreign ministers meet in moscow at the end of june . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran gives cautious reception to nuclear offer iran on tuesday gave a cautious reception to an international proposal aimed at resolving the crisis over its disputed nuclear drive , saying the offer contains " positive steps " but also " ambiguities .

it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .

if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .

while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .

anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .

the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .

" the prime minister announces the killing of jordanian abu musab al-zarqawi , the head of an organization known as al qaeda in mesopotamia , " the television reported .
the report said zarqawi had been killed south of baghdad . nuri al-maliki announced thursday that al-zarqawi " has been eliminated . " " what happened ... is the result of collaboration from people who facilitated the operation conducted by iraqi police and multinational forces , " maliki told reporters . " this is a message to those who chose the path of violence to change their direction before it is too late .
i thank our forces , our police and the multinational forces for what they are doing in pursuing the terrorists , " the iraqi prime minister said . us news network abc reported on thursday that al-zarqawi was killed in a joint attack by us helicopters and iraqi forces .
it said us helicopters hit a house near baquba , 40 miles -lrb- 65 km -rrb- north of baghdad , at 6 p.m. local time on wednesday .
" zarqawi was apparently injured at first ...
the americans found him .
they handed him over to the iraqis and he later died of his injuries , " abc said . it said seven people were hit in the helicopter attack , including two women , but it was not clear how many were killed or wounded . us forces confirm killing general george w. casey jr , head of us-led forces in iraq , told a press conference that zarqawi and one of his key lieutenants , spiritual advisor sheikh abdel rahman , were killed at 6:15 pm -lrb- 1415 cet -rrb- wednesday in an air strike on an isolated safe house .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .

at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .
his forthcomi n g book , co-authored with aleksa n dr furse n ko , is called " kruschev 's war : the i n side story of a n america n adversary .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity .

funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .

and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.06.2006 some soccer fans want to reclaim the game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans want to take the power back and reclaim soccer the world cup , which starts friday , will be the culmination of two years of hype that has left no marketing stone unturned .
for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling . for the better part of two years , over 80 million germans have been literally bombarded by an advertising blitz that has reached epic proportions .
it would be almost impossible for someone living in the country not to have heard about the world cup . tournament sponsors know this and have sent out an interminable advertising barrage .
mcdonalds and coca-cola aim at armchair coaches ; adidas at potential stars on the pitch ; mastercard at the cash strapped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be it sweet or sweaty , it has to be associated with the world cup the commercialization of the world 's most-watched sporting event , and soccer in general , over the past decade and a half has led to a counter reaction amongst fans . initiatives , demonstrations , and magazines have taken aim at functionaries like fifa president sepp blatter or germany world cup organizer franz beckenbauer , and are calling on fans to " reclaim the game . " security concerns abused many think the reclamation of the sport must start at the fan base .
since violence off the pitch often gains as much attention as the final score on it , fears that hooliganism may scar " the beautiful game " have led to security measures some feel are excessive , preventing fans from even making contact with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody needs a shoulder to lean on - and a bed to sleep in the project " ein dach für fans " -lrb- edff -rrb- , or " one roof for fans , " was founded in dortmund in 2004 to " provide friendly , people-uniting contacts between german and soccer fans from around the world " .
for edff coordinator , peter schüngel , projects like these are necessary as a counterweight to commercialization , which he thinks has played a key role in fueling aggression between fans from other cities and countries . " wherever money is being made , it 's a law of nature that security will be optimized so that the process can continue , " the 54-year-old said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much security can actually cause tensions to boil over he is careful to add that when he makes such comments to the press , he does n't intend to sound like a leftist railing against capitalism .
schüngel admitted that soccer has profited immensely from commercialization , but he said there are limits as to how far security should extend to protect it . " the separation of fans leads to xenophobia .
with the roof project , we bring supporters together .
i ca n't but recall a saying from an englishman about soccer fans : ' we 're friends and rivals in a common affair ' , " he said . " eat the rich " the heads of the alliance of active football fans -lrb- baff -rrb- have minced no words in expressing their distaste for the overkill of corporate sponsorship at the world cup .
on their web site , baff turned the world cup mascot - the oversized , cuddly , but unloved lion goleo - into prolleo , a beer-guzzling , teeth-baring lion , escorted by a bottle of lager . prolleo 's raison d 'etre can be read on the back of his blue jeans vest : " eat the rich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo may be sweet , but for baff the lion symbolizes cold commercialization it is exactly money , or to be more specific , the need of supporters to have lots of money to view soccer matches , that drives baff .
vip areas , the world cup ticket lottery , and the privileges of sponsors have created a gap that leaves the " poor " fan standing on the outside , looking in . giving fans a voice the media hype regarding the world cup and the sport overall has left many a soccer supporter alienated .
it 's no longer about which team wins on the field .
the bonds between players and supporters have taken a back seat to the bottom line of wealthy owners , many of whom do n't come from the club 's city or even country .
russian tycoon roman abramovich , owner of london 's chelsea , or american billionaire malcolm glazer , who owns manchester united , are prime examples . the german soccer magazine 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- was born as a result of this fan-team deficit at the turn of the millennium . " i think the big problem at that time was that there was no publication where people could raise their voice against the commercialization of the sport .
we made it our goal to give the fans a voice , " said the magazine 's editor-in-chief , philipp köster . the 34-year-old pointed out that 11 freunde openly supports groups like baff without going as far as being a mouthpiece for them .
as a businessman trying to turn a profit , he knows 11 freunde walks a thin line between being called hypocritical if too many ads appear , and the alternative - closing up shop . for his publication , the world cup will be a chance to focus on the events that are n't in the spotlight .
the fans have been " worn down " by what köster called a " spectacle of commerce . "

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is . " positive sig n als from tehera n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz nuclear power is located 270 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south of tehran the iaea has called on tehran , most recently in february , to suspend all uranium enrichment activities .
the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works . " an influential member of the national security committee , rashid jalali jafari , said iran welcomes negotiations but reserves its national rights . " we should accept negotiations , but on the condition that the europeans do not sabotage our national interests , " he told the semi-official news agency mehr . top national security official ali larijani has said the proposals contain " positive steps " but also " ambiguities " - signaling no immediate decision from tehran was likely . no more sa n ctio n s for tehera n ? diplomats say the united states has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if tehran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington has also agreed to join multilateral talks with iran if it suspends its uranium-enrichment actavities , offering the prospect of the first substantive talks between the two arch-enemies for 26 years . diplomats said that if iran negotiations go well , enrichment on iranian soil could be possible - but that such a situation is years away . " it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2006 iran open to nuclear talks but will not discuss technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad in front of a picture of iran 's ayatollah ali khamenei iran 's controversial president mahmoud ahmadinejad said he was willing to get back to the negotiating table regarding his country 's disputed nuclear program .
but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is . " positive sig n als from tehera n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz nuclear power is located 270 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south of tehran the iaea has called on tehran , most recently in february , to suspend all uranium enrichment activities .
the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works . " an influential member of the national security committee , rashid jalali jafari , said iran welcomes negotiations but reserves its national rights . " we should accept negotiations , but on the condition that the europeans do not sabotage our national interests , " he told the semi-official news agency mehr . top national security official ali larijani has said the proposals contain " positive steps " but also " ambiguities " - signaling no immediate decision from tehran was likely . no more sa n ctio n s for tehera n ? diplomats say the united states has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if tehran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington has also agreed to join multilateral talks with iran if it suspends its uranium-enrichment actavities , offering the prospect of the first substantive talks between the two arch-enemies for 26 years . diplomats said that if iran negotiations go well , enrichment on iranian soil could be possible - but that such a situation is years away . " it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .
it said the west would be ready to negotiate on other terms of the offer .
-lrb- june 8 , 2006 -rrb- iran gives cautious reception to nuclear offer iran on tuesday gave a cautious reception to an international proposal aimed at resolving the crisis over its disputed nuclear drive , saying the offer contains " positive steps " but also " ambiguities . "
-lrb- june 6 , 2006 -rrb- solana heads to iran with package of incentives european union foreign policy chief javier solana was expected in tehran late monday to submit an international nuclear proposal to iran 's leadership which has already said it 's prepared to study the offer .

there were huge roars of appreciation from the fans when pictures of previous world cup heroes , such as argentina 's diego maradona , brazil 's pele and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , were shown .
fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 . " it 's beautiful , it 's a very well-organized event , " he said .
some fans were not paying much attention to what was happening on stage as they continued singing and dancing to their own songs throughout the night . few match tickets but robledo muccer from porto alegre , brazil , complained about the limited number of tickets that were available . " i am only here in germany for one match because i only managed get one ticket , " he said , adding that he would have loved to watch more games . muccer was not the only one - there was a large number of fans who also complained about failing to secure more than one ticket to their team 's world cup matches .

" poland will win the 2006 world cup , " they told everyone they met . ecuadorian paulina vasquez who has been in berlin for a month already , was more realistic about her country 's chances in the competition . " brazil will win the world cup , i hope we make it to the finals and at least finish second , " she said . and fabricio otarola from costa rica said he has never seen an event as big as this ceremony . " it 's amazing and really nice , " he said , adding that if berlin 's opening party was an indication of what was still to come , it would turn out to be a " really great " world cup .

for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling . for the better part of two years , over 80 million germans have been literally bombarded by an advertising blitz that has reached epic proportions .
it would be almost impossible for someone living in the country not to have heard about the world cup . tournament sponsors know this and have sent out an interminable advertising barrage .
mcdonalds and coca-cola aim at armchair coaches ; adidas at potential stars on the pitch ; mastercard at the cash strapped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be it sweet or sweaty , it has to be associated with the world cup the commercialization of the world 's most-watched sporting event , and soccer in general , over the past decade and a half has led to a counter reaction amongst fans . initiatives , demonstrations , and magazines have taken aim at functionaries like fifa president sepp blatter or germany world cup organizer franz beckenbauer , and are calling on fans to " reclaim the game . " security concerns abused many think the reclamation of the sport must start at the fan base .
since violence off the pitch often gains as much attention as the final score on it , fears that hooliganism may scar " the beautiful game " have led to security measures some feel are excessive , preventing fans from even making contact with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody needs a shoulder to lean on - and a bed to sleep in the project " ein dach für fans " -lrb- edff -rrb- , or " one roof for fans , " was founded in dortmund in 2004 to " provide friendly , people-uniting contacts between german and soccer fans from around the world " .
for edff coordinator , peter schüngel , projects like these are necessary as a counterweight to commercialization , which he thinks has played a key role in fueling aggression between fans from other cities and countries . " wherever money is being made , it 's a law of nature that security will be optimized so that the process can continue , " the 54-year-old said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much security can actually cause tensions to boil over he is careful to add that when he makes such comments to the press , he does n't intend to sound like a leftist railing against capitalism .
schüngel admitted that soccer has profited immensely from commercialization , but he said there are limits as to how far security should extend to protect it . " the separation of fans leads to xenophobia .
with the roof project , we bring supporters together .
i ca n't but recall a saying from an englishman about soccer fans : ' we 're friends and rivals in a common affair ' , " he said . " eat the rich " the heads of the alliance of active football fans -lrb- baff -rrb- have minced no words in expressing their distaste for the overkill of corporate sponsorship at the world cup .
on their web site , baff turned the world cup mascot - the oversized , cuddly , but unloved lion goleo - into prolleo , a beer-guzzling , teeth-baring lion , escorted by a bottle of lager . prolleo 's raison d 'etre can be read on the back of his blue jeans vest : " eat the rich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo may be sweet , but for baff the lion symbolizes cold commercialization it is exactly money , or to be more specific , the need of supporters to have lots of money to view soccer matches , that drives baff .
vip areas , the world cup ticket lottery , and the privileges of sponsors have created a gap that leaves the " poor " fan standing on the outside , looking in . giving fans a voice the media hype regarding the world cup and the sport overall has left many a soccer supporter alienated .
it 's no longer about which team wins on the field .
the bonds between players and supporters have taken a back seat to the bottom line of wealthy owners , many of whom do n't come from the club 's city or even country .
russian tycoon roman abramovich , owner of london 's chelsea , or american billionaire malcolm glazer , who owns manchester united , are prime examples . the german soccer magazine 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- was born as a result of this fan-team deficit at the turn of the millennium . " i think the big problem at that time was that there was no publication where people could raise their voice against the commercialization of the sport .
we made it our goal to give the fans a voice , " said the magazine 's editor-in-chief , philipp köster . the 34-year-old pointed out that 11 freunde openly supports groups like baff without going as far as being a mouthpiece for them .
as a businessman trying to turn a profit , he knows 11 freunde walks a thin line between being called hypocritical if too many ads appear , and the alternative - closing up shop . for his publication , the world cup will be a chance to focus on the events that are n't in the spotlight .
the fans have been " worn down " by what köster called a " spectacle of commerce . "
what everybody most wants now is for the games simply to begin . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving shelter to soccer fans instead of sending soccer fans to the family tree to look for long-lost german relatives with a free room , a number of internet sites are connecting fans to thousands of empty guest beds and extra sofas in german homes .
-lrb- june 3 , 2006 -rrb- eleven friends and their love of soccer for the past five years , a scrappy fan-focused soccer magazine has been winning hearts in germany .

it said the west would be ready to negotiate on other terms of the offer . european union foreign policy chief javier solana delivered the offer to tehran on tuesday , with a delegation of senior officials from the " eu3 " - france , britain and germany - and from russia .
iran said it saw some positive aspects , although there were some " ambiguities . " " this is an offer to kick off negotiations but there must first be a suspension of -lrb- enrichment -rrb- activities implemented by iran , " chancellor angela merkel told reporters before a meeting with solana , who was in berlin . " it is a broad and comprehensive offer .
i believe it is a huge chance and i hope that we 'll do a bit of negotiating . " the proposals , which have not been made public but include incentives and penalties , seek to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program , which many countries fear will be used to build atomic bombs .
tehran insists that its nuclear aims are purely peaceful . solana said in an interview to appear in thursday 's tagespiegel newspaper that what iran had received were " elements of a proposal which are the basis for later negotiations . " " the package enables iran to have civilian nuclear energy and access to technology , and it offers economic incentives , above all in the energy sector , " the paper quoted solana as saying . " significant chance " merkel urged the iranians to consider the offer seriously , saying this was an opportunity to secure a peaceful resolution to the long nuclear standoff between iran and the west . " i believe that it is a truly significant chance to resolve this conflict diplomatically , " she said .
" and everyone should be aware of his responsibility in this context . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana in tehran on tuesday iranian officials said the incentives included access to aircraft parts needed to renovate its ageing civilian fleet and the chance to purchase u.s. agricultural technology . eu diplomats have said the package includes an offer of light-water nuclear reactors and security guarantees .
western diplomats said the us was not expected to provide nuclear technology or equipment directly to iran .
instead , europeans and russians would be the prime contractors . cautious optimism on tuesday , us president george w. bush said he was encouraged by iran 's initial response although he remained cautious . " it sounds like a positive step to me , " bush said in laredo , texas .
" i have said the united states will come and sit down at the table with them as long as they 're willing to suspend their enrichment in a verifiable way .

" the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah .

" we are working on a mechanism to put the money in a context of humanitarian aid in broader context and to get as many donors in the same mechanism , " solana said , hoping that the matter would be finalized quickly . after hamas took over in march , it has been unable to cover salaries for civil servants sparking riots and fears of a civil war . oppositio n to the pla n eu officials said that approval is still dependent on washington which is opposing directly paying palestinian salaries because it takes pressure off hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas wants hamas to agree to a compromise with israel instead , the plan calls for about $ 30 million in " social allowances " which would cover about a quarter of the palestinian authority 's monthly wage expenditures . according to the plan , donors would transfer money into bank accounts under abbas ' office that would flow directly to beneficiaries .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .
his forthcomi n g book , co-authored with aleksa n dr furse n ko , is called " kruschev 's war : the i n side story of a n america n adversary .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .
he told spiegel-online , " we 're the pioneers yet again .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .

nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .

anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .

the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is . " positive sig n als from tehera n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz nuclear power is located 270 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south of tehran the iaea has called on tehran , most recently in february , to suspend all uranium enrichment activities .
the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works . " an influential member of the national security committee , rashid jalali jafari , said iran welcomes negotiations but reserves its national rights . " we should accept negotiations , but on the condition that the europeans do not sabotage our national interests , " he told the semi-official news agency mehr . top national security official ali larijani has said the proposals contain " positive steps " but also " ambiguities " - signaling no immediate decision from tehran was likely . no more sa n ctio n s for tehera n ? diplomats say the united states has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if tehran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington has also agreed to join multilateral talks with iran if it suspends its uranium-enrichment actavities , offering the prospect of the first substantive talks between the two arch-enemies for 26 years . diplomats said that if iran negotiations go well , enrichment on iranian soil could be possible - but that such a situation is years away . " it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .

he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is . " positive sig n als from tehera n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz nuclear power is located 270 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south of tehran the iaea has called on tehran , most recently in february , to suspend all uranium enrichment activities .
the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works .

" it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is . " positive sig n als from tehera n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz nuclear power is located 270 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south of tehran the iaea has called on tehran , most recently in february , to suspend all uranium enrichment activities .
the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works . " an influential member of the national security committee , rashid jalali jafari , said iran welcomes negotiations but reserves its national rights . " we should accept negotiations , but on the condition that the europeans do not sabotage our national interests , " he told the semi-official news agency mehr . top national security official ali larijani has said the proposals contain " positive steps " but also " ambiguities " - signaling no immediate decision from tehran was likely . no more sa n ctio n s for tehera n ? diplomats say the united states has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if tehran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington has also agreed to join multilateral talks with iran if it suspends its uranium-enrichment actavities , offering the prospect of the first substantive talks between the two arch-enemies for 26 years . diplomats said that if iran negotiations go well , enrichment on iranian soil could be possible - but that such a situation is years away . " it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is . " positive sig n als from tehera n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natanz nuclear power is located 270 km -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- south of tehran the iaea has called on tehran , most recently in february , to suspend all uranium enrichment activities .
the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works . " an influential member of the national security committee , rashid jalali jafari , said iran welcomes negotiations but reserves its national rights . " we should accept negotiations , but on the condition that the europeans do not sabotage our national interests , " he told the semi-official news agency mehr . top national security official ali larijani has said the proposals contain " positive steps " but also " ambiguities " - signaling no immediate decision from tehran was likely . no more sa n ctio n s for tehera n ? diplomats say the united states has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if tehran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington has also agreed to join multilateral talks with iran if it suspends its uranium-enrichment actavities , offering the prospect of the first substantive talks between the two arch-enemies for 26 years . diplomats said that if iran negotiations go well , enrichment on iranian soil could be possible - but that such a situation is years away . " it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .
it said the west would be ready to negotiate on other terms of the offer .
-lrb- june 8 , 2006 -rrb- iran gives cautious reception to nuclear offer iran on tuesday gave a cautious reception to an international proposal aimed at resolving the crisis over its disputed nuclear drive , saying the offer contains " positive steps " but also " ambiguities . "

the so-called " fan mile " area , which has been set up along a major boulevard to the west of the gate , came to a stand-still as fans came in droves and took the opportunity to bond in true world cup spirit . large scree n displays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting into the world cup spirit at the brandenburger tor most relied on the large screen displays to witness what was happening as not everyone could catch a glimpse of the stage .
there were huge roars of appreciation from the fans when pictures of previous world cup heroes , such as argentina 's diego maradona , brazil 's pele and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , were shown .
fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 . " it 's beautiful , it 's a very well-organized event , " he said .
some fans were not paying much attention to what was happening on stage as they continued singing and dancing to their own songs throughout the night . few match tickets but robledo muccer from porto alegre , brazil , complained about the limited number of tickets that were available . " i am only here in germany for one match because i only managed get one ticket , " he said , adding that he would have loved to watch more games . muccer was not the only one - there was a large number of fans who also complained about failing to secure more than one ticket to their team 's world cup matches .

" poland will win the 2006 world cup , " they told everyone they met . ecuadorian paulina vasquez who has been in berlin for a month already , was more realistic about her country 's chances in the competition . " brazil will win the world cup , i hope we make it to the finals and at least finish second , " she said . and fabricio otarola from costa rica said he has never seen an event as big as this ceremony . " it 's amazing and really nice , " he said , adding that if berlin 's opening party was an indication of what was still to come , it would turn out to be a " really great " world cup .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

" the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas in the west bank town of ramallah .
" the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 . " avoidi n g fi n a n cial meltdow n the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues .
that is because hamas has refused to recognize israel , renounce violence or honor the peace agreements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana hopes the aid will be delivered by july to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . " we are working on a mechanism to put the money in a context of humanitarian aid in broader context and to get as many donors in the same mechanism , " solana said , hoping that the matter would be finalized quickly . after hamas took over in march , it has been unable to cover salaries for civil servants sparking riots and fears of a civil war . oppositio n to the pla n eu officials said that approval is still dependent on washington which is opposing directly paying palestinian salaries because it takes pressure off hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas wants hamas to agree to a compromise with israel instead , the plan calls for about $ 30 million in " social allowances " which would cover about a quarter of the palestinian authority 's monthly wage expenditures . according to the plan , donors would transfer money into bank accounts under abbas ' office that would flow directly to beneficiaries .
and audits would ensure that money did not get diverted to hamas .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

the so-called " fan mile " area , which has been set up along a major boulevard to the west of the gate , came to a stand-still as fans came in droves and took the opportunity to bond in true world cup spirit . large scree n displays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting into the world cup spirit at the brandenburger tor most relied on the large screen displays to witness what was happening as not everyone could catch a glimpse of the stage .
there were huge roars of appreciation from the fans when pictures of previous world cup heroes , such as argentina 's diego maradona , brazil 's pele and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , were shown .
fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 . " it 's beautiful , it 's a very well-organized event , " he said .
some fans were not paying much attention to what was happening on stage as they continued singing and dancing to their own songs throughout the night . few match tickets but robledo muccer from porto alegre , brazil , complained about the limited number of tickets that were available . " i am only here in germany for one match because i only managed get one ticket , " he said , adding that he would have loved to watch more games . muccer was not the only one - there was a large number of fans who also complained about failing to secure more than one ticket to their team 's world cup matches .
most said they will be in berlin for the duration of the world cup and will watch other games at the public viewing camps , some of which carry up to 10,000 fans . ambitious fa n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from different walks of life but together for the world cup in berlin some fans took the opportunity to show their ambitions as they bragged that their teams were better prepared and ready to lift the world cup . polish friends wojciech szpata and maciy zurawik , from jelenia gora , poland , clad in their country 's colors , were among the ambitious ones . " poland will win the 2006 world cup , " they told everyone they met . ecuadorian paulina vasquez who has been in berlin for a month already , was more realistic about her country 's chances in the competition . " brazil will win the world cup , i hope we make it to the finals and at least finish second , " she said . and fabricio otarola from costa rica said he has never seen an event as big as this ceremony . " it 's amazing and really nice , " he said , adding that if berlin 's opening party was an indication of what was still to come , it would turn out to be a " really great " world cup .
" our country is small , we do n't see such big events often . " isaac mahlangu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de some soccer fans want to reclaim the game the world cup , which starts friday , will be the culmination of two years of hype that has left no marketing stone unturned .
for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling .

the so-called " fan mile " area , which has been set up along a major boulevard to the west of the gate , came to a stand-still as fans came in droves and took the opportunity to bond in true world cup spirit . large scree n displays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting into the world cup spirit at the brandenburger tor most relied on the large screen displays to witness what was happening as not everyone could catch a glimpse of the stage .
there were huge roars of appreciation from the fans when pictures of previous world cup heroes , such as argentina 's diego maradona , brazil 's pele and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , were shown .
fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 . " it 's beautiful , it 's a very well-organized event , " he said .
some fans were not paying much attention to what was happening on stage as they continued singing and dancing to their own songs throughout the night . few match tickets but robledo muccer from porto alegre , brazil , complained about the limited number of tickets that were available . " i am only here in germany for one match because i only managed get one ticket , " he said , adding that he would have loved to watch more games . muccer was not the only one - there was a large number of fans who also complained about failing to secure more than one ticket to their team 's world cup matches .

" poland will win the 2006 world cup , " they told everyone they met . ecuadorian paulina vasquez who has been in berlin for a month already , was more realistic about her country 's chances in the competition . " brazil will win the world cup , i hope we make it to the finals and at least finish second , " she said . and fabricio otarola from costa rica said he has never seen an event as big as this ceremony . " it 's amazing and really nice , " he said , adding that if berlin 's opening party was an indication of what was still to come , it would turn out to be a " really great " world cup .

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday .

the so-called " fan mile " area , which has been set up along a major boulevard to the west of the gate , came to a stand-still as fans came in droves and took the opportunity to bond in true world cup spirit . large scree n displays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting into the world cup spirit at the brandenburger tor most relied on the large screen displays to witness what was happening as not everyone could catch a glimpse of the stage .
there were huge roars of appreciation from the fans when pictures of previous world cup heroes , such as argentina 's diego maradona , brazil 's pele and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , were shown .
fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 . " it 's beautiful , it 's a very well-organized event , " he said .
some fans were not paying much attention to what was happening on stage as they continued singing and dancing to their own songs throughout the night . few match tickets but robledo muccer from porto alegre , brazil , complained about the limited number of tickets that were available . " i am only here in germany for one match because i only managed get one ticket , " he said , adding that he would have loved to watch more games . muccer was not the only one - there was a large number of fans who also complained about failing to secure more than one ticket to their team 's world cup matches .
most said they will be in berlin for the duration of the world cup and will watch other games at the public viewing camps , some of which carry up to 10,000 fans . ambitious fa n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from different walks of life but together for the world cup in berlin some fans took the opportunity to show their ambitions as they bragged that their teams were better prepared and ready to lift the world cup . polish friends wojciech szpata and maciy zurawik , from jelenia gora , poland , clad in their country 's colors , were among the ambitious ones . " poland will win the 2006 world cup , " they told everyone they met . ecuadorian paulina vasquez who has been in berlin for a month already , was more realistic about her country 's chances in the competition . " brazil will win the world cup , i hope we make it to the finals and at least finish second , " she said . and fabricio otarola from costa rica said he has never seen an event as big as this ceremony . " it 's amazing and really nice , " he said , adding that if berlin 's opening party was an indication of what was still to come , it would turn out to be a " really great " world cup .
" our country is small , we do n't see such big events often .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .
he told spiegel-online , " we 're the pioneers yet again .

he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .
he told spiegel-online , " we 're the pioneers yet again .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

but he warned the west of trying to dictate too much . amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over iran 's controversial nuclear aims , iranian president ahmadinejad said on thursday he was open to nuclear talks with the west , but that technology was not up for discussion . " we will negotiate about common concerns and for clearing up misunderstandings in the international atmosphere , " ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast on state television .
" but we will never negotiate about what kind of technology we want to use . " the international package - which offers trade , diplomatic and technology incentives in return for a freeze of uranium enrichment - was drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . iran faces robust un security council action , including a range of possible sanctions , if it rejects the offer . to e n rich or n ot to e n rich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists that its nuclear program has been created for peaceful purposes according to diplomatic sources in vienna and tehran , the offer would eventually allow iran to enrich uranium on its territory , but only after the approval of the international community . the united states on wednesday refused to confirm or deny those reports , dismissing them as " hypothetical and theoretical . "
it reiterated that iran must suspend all uranium enrichment on its soil as a condition for washington 's participation in negotiations with the islamic republic . iran insists its nuclear program is designed purely to generate electricity but the united states and others are concerned tehran is secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons . a sudde n decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea head mohamed el baradei will issue a written report on recent developments meanwhile , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- was set to issue a report on " the latest observations from inspectors who have just reported their latest information from -lrb- the iranian enrichment facility in -rrb- natanz , " iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . diplomats said iaea director mohamed el baradei had decided only this week to issue a written report , having originally planned to make an oral presentation when the board meets on monday . " it must be a very sudden decision , " a senior european diplomat said , adding that the report was expected to be short , from one-and-a-half to three pages .
" but it will be interesting to see what they have to say on natanz and on what the situation there is .

the last report , on april 28 , made clear that iran was not heeding the iaea 's call to suspend uranium enrichment . iaea inspectors monitor natanz , in central iran , as part of routine safeguards under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . iran has since april 11 been enriching uranium at a centrifuge cascade in natanz , but only to levels of up to five percent , which is refined enough for nuclear fuel but far below what is needed for weapons work . eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who presented the proposal in tehran on tuesday , said the next day he was " more optimistic today than a month ago " - when iran was ruling out any talk of halting sensitive nuclear work . disse n ti n g voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana , left , met with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on tuesday but while foreign minister manouchehr mottaki vowed that the proposals would be " carefully " studied , some iranian mps were signaling their opposition to the offer . " we can not suspend our peaceful nuclear activities , " the head of parliament 's education committee , ali abbaspour , told student news agency isna thursday .
" we are ready to guarantee that our activity is peaceful .
but we can not accept that we deprive ourselves of scientific research and works . " an influential member of the national security committee , rashid jalali jafari , said iran welcomes negotiations but reserves its national rights . " we should accept negotiations , but on the condition that the europeans do not sabotage our national interests , " he told the semi-official news agency mehr . top national security official ali larijani has said the proposals contain " positive steps " but also " ambiguities " - signaling no immediate decision from tehran was likely . no more sa n ctio n s for tehera n ? diplomats say the united states has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if tehran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington has also agreed to join multilateral talks with iran if it suspends its uranium-enrichment actavities , offering the prospect of the first substantive talks between the two arch-enemies for 26 years . diplomats said that if iran negotiations go well , enrichment on iranian soil could be possible - but that such a situation is years away . " it leaves the door open to enrichment under certain caveats , " a european diplomat told afp in vienna , referring to what would almost certainly be a process of many years to verify that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . the package only calls on iran to " suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities " in order to resume talks with european negotiators britain , france and germany , and perhaps the united states and even iranian allies russia and china , the diplomat said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks iran to take solana offer seriously germany told iran on wednesday that it must halt enrichment work under an incentive package to end its nuclear dispute with the west .

" a n ovelty for germa n y merkel is following in the footsteps of us president bush and his predecessors , who have been communicating with their nation in weekly radio addresses for decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he started it all : u.s. president franklin roosevelt the us tradition goes back to president franklin delano roosevelt , who introduced the practice of routine radio broadcasts in the 1930s .
during the second world war , fdr 's radio broadcasts - which he cozily referred to as " fireside chats " - significantly boosted american morale and greatly contributed to the president 's popularity . by opting for video-podcast internet technology rather than using radio or television to talk to citizens , merkel - a former scientist turned politician - is ushering in a new era in the development of internet-mediated digital democracy . " merkel is the first head of government to be using the video podcast medium , " steg said . the first female chancellor in german history is known for being technologically savvy .
she routinely communicates with her ministers via sms - a text messaging practice using cell phone keypads , which is a widely popular , if not exactly efficient , form of communication in europe , especially among teenagers . noble goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-tasking , multi-media kind of chancellor : angela merkel merkel 's video podcasts - or vodcasts , as they are sometimes referred to - will not replace the chancellor 's traditional new year 's address on television .
but , as the government spokesperson pointed out , the goal of the video podcasts will be " to stay true to the ancient democratic principle of informing people as well as possible so that they can form their own opinion . " the chancellor 's messages will be formatted to be viewed on computer screens .
a cell phone version is also in the making .
each podcast will be two to three minutes long and available on the chancellor 's website under the catchy motto " chancellor direct . " it is yet to be seen how popular merkel 's videocasts will be .
merkel is an extremely well-liked chancellor , yet she still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
one comedy show , for example , includes a regular segment called " angie 's diary , " in which a bearded actor , wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , reads stories from the chancellor 's imaginary diary . no glitches , please ! with her video podcasts in the digital form , merkel will now open herself to all sorts of artistic re-interpretations in the style of mtv mashups .
be prepared for a new video of angela merkel and nelly furtado , set to a drum-and-bass sample , on an ipod near you . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already as teenagers , europeans develop a love affair with their cell phones the chancellery will in any case have to make sure that the process of downloading and viewing merkel 's video messages is smooth and easy , and that her web site never displays the dreaded - and politically incorrect - error message " access denied . " germans , on the other hand , are no strangers technological glitches as far as their elected leaders are concerned .
in 1987 , hundreds of thousands of germans experienced an eerie sense of deja-vu while watching the new year 's television address of then chancellor helmut kohl .
as it later turned out , a german broadcaster had aired the tape with kohl 's new year 's address from the previous year by mistake . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world-shaping angies a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .

" no , " they respond .
" we rock the world . "

here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .

to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .

i believe it is a huge chance and i hope that we 'll do a bit of negotiating . " the proposals , which have not been made public but include incentives and penalties , seek to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program , which many countries fear will be used to build atomic bombs .
tehran insists that its nuclear aims are purely peaceful . solana said in an interview to appear in thursday 's tagespiegel newspaper that what iran had received were " elements of a proposal which are the basis for later negotiations .

and the uniforms will also be exchanged for new ones bearing the t-com logo -lrb- t-com 's corporate color is hot pink . -rrb-
the deal , reported at 60 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- , was announced by deutsche telekom board member walter raizner wednesday in munich .
t-com is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . professional soccer teams in england , france , austria and many other european countries already wear the names of corporate sponsors .
some discussion of deutsche telekom 's new sponsorship is to be expected , christian seifert , head negotiator for the bundesliga , told the associated press , but " the question is , why are we only just starting it now ? " the uniform and name changes can not be implemented in the 2006/2007 season for logistical reasons related to the world cup , but come august 2007 , " every fan who buys a jersey will be wearing a telekom ad on his body , " dresdner bank 's chris-oliver schickentanz told spiegel-online news site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile advertisements that jump , run and score battle of the broadcasters but jerseys and logos are only the half of it .
the sponsorship deal came about during the months of intense negotiations that ensued after the bundesliga put broadcasting rights of all games up for bids . deutsche telekom won the right to broadcast all bundesliga games - but only via broadband internet , which should be available soon in germany 's 10 largest cities .
rights to the games on cable and satellite television , including public broadcasts in pubs and bars , went to pay broadcaster arena .
this was an upset to premiere , the subscription broadcaster who had previously owned the television broadcasting rights to bundesliga games . the business of blunders premiere , however , picked up on a crucial loophole in this high-profile deal and tried to join forces with deutsche telekom to finally score a goal - or at least a few euros .
it does n't take an it expert to know that viewing internet broadcasts on television has been possible for a while now , a point the bundesliga apparently had n't considered when they put the broadcasting rights up for sale . the bundesliga did recognize that deutsche telekom 's right to internet broadcasts technically included television , even though arena had paid more than four times as much for the formal television rights .
but in order to avoid any legal complications , the bonn-based telecommunications giant decided to abdicate their implied television broadcasting rights , which they handed over to premiere in an official agreement .
the bundesliga will give them a rebate on the original price for their " generosity . " unfortunately for premiere , the munich-based station will only be able to broadcast to a small portion of their customers - those with the appropriate broadband technology from deutsche telekom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich based subscription broadcaster will soon lose its exclusive rights to broadcast bundesliga games live via cable and satellite winners and losers deutsche telekom has plenty of reasons to cheer , but the bundesliga also sees itself as a winner .
funds from the new sponsor can help " keep soccer at the highest level , " said bundesliga president werner hackmann , according to reuters .
" for the fan on the street , it 's important to know where he can get what , " he added .
and arena ceo christoph bellmer was pleased that it was finally clear to fans that live bundesliga games via cable and satellite would be exclusively available from arena . every game has a loser and premiere got the short straw this time , but - in spite of a 6 percent drop in stock on wednesday - they were n't letting that get them down .
even though their customer base for live bundesliga games is restricted by the new technology , premiere director georg kofler 's cup is half full .

the so-called " fan mile " area , which has been set up along a major boulevard to the west of the gate , came to a stand-still as fans came in droves and took the opportunity to bond in true world cup spirit . large scree n displays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting into the world cup spirit at the brandenburger tor most relied on the large screen displays to witness what was happening as not everyone could catch a glimpse of the stage .
there were huge roars of appreciation from the fans when pictures of previous world cup heroes , such as argentina 's diego maradona , brazil 's pele and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , were shown .
fans , decked out in the countries ' colors , flew their flags high , some beating drums and belting out songs as if they were in a singing competition . for marc wagner , from falkensee outside berlin , the event was as good as an official one could have been - berliners were devastated earlier this year when fifa officials cancelled a massive opening gala in the city 's olympiastadion because of fears that the grass would not recover in time for the first game on june 13 . " it 's beautiful , it 's a very well-organized event , " he said .
some fans were not paying much attention to what was happening on stage as they continued singing and dancing to their own songs throughout the night . few match tickets but robledo muccer from porto alegre , brazil , complained about the limited number of tickets that were available .

it 's about passion , excitement and participation .
it 's also about going a bit crazy .
here dw-world.de offers five of the most bizarre aspects of the 2006 world cup . you may have heard that there is some kind of sporting event taking place in germany this summer .
unless you 've been on vacation recently you could not have failed to notice that the world cup is upon us again and is proudly being presented by the germans . while the on-field action during the four-week long tournament will be the focus of many millions of soccer fans all over the globe , the past six years have been full of stories about the preparations those meticulous germans have been going through .
it has seemed that not a day has gone by when there has not been a story about the ups and downs experienced by the german organizing committee and its somewhat dominating bed-fellow fifa . surely every angle of every topic has been covered ; from investigations into the incredulous ticketing process to doctoral theses on why mascot goleo does n't wear pants . now , as foot finally makes contact with ball , we can forget about the bells and whistles and concentrate on the main event - the soccer itself . but to do so would be to ignore some of the more bizarre aspects of this world cup .
while it is all well and good to know what formation is being played by your team and who the coach is with the huge throbbing vein on the side of his head , a little bit of surreal extra information will make your world cup experience a more rounded and enjoyable one . here dw-world.de presents five of the more surreal stories from the sidelines of the 2006 fifa world cup . most bizarre world cup incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blokhin : like it or not , you 're going to have sex ukraine are playing in their first ever world cup finals and , unsurprisingly , hope to do very well .
while everything has been done to prepare players like andrei schevchenko and sergei rebrov for the big stage , coach oleg blokhin has added an extra incentive to his coaching arsenal in a bid to get the very best out of his stars .
if winning the world cup was not incentive enough , the ukrainian coach has promised that he will waive the squad 's rule on celibacy if the team get to the semi-final and allow the players to have sex with their wives and girlfriends .
not only will he allow this , but blokhin has assured his players that there will be no choice in the matter : " those who do n't feel like it , i 'll just drag to their wives . " this may be counter-productive in a couple of ways .
firstly , the sight of a reluctant partner being dragged to the marital bed by the imposing former soviet union striker is unlikely to promote harmony between the couples .
secondly , if ukraine reaches the semi-finals on a no-sex diet , will getting the team off really increase their chances ?
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . most bizarre world cup merchandise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more players will be complaining of pins and needles forget exhibitionist carnivore goleo and his psychedelic talking-ball sidekick pille .
nothing that odd couple has come up with to date can rate anywhere near as spooky as the world cup voodoo dolls which have been on sale in germany during the run-up to the world cup .
the footoo kit comes with a number of national emblems and colors so that you dress your rather panicked looking doll in the team uniform of those opponents you want to hex .
you also get a set of five long needles , all for under 20 euros .
there is , however , no guarantee with the doll but rumors of satisfied customers in the host nation who purchased the wayne rooney doll are multiple . most bizarre world cup job it was advertised as a way of getting germany 's 4 million-plus unemployed out into the arena of work again , doing something for the country and improving their chances of permanent employment once all the madness was over .
the world cup job initiative was set up to fill all the holes in the service and maintenance sectors ; creating teams of catering staff , builders , cleaners and guides where there were none before . for long-term unemployed , it sounded too good to be true .
to others , the chance of working at the world cup was a chance too good to miss .
so , spare a thought for those volunteers who have been charged with stopping naked streakers during matches .
training includes - among other things - how , and where , to grab pitch invaders in a way to avoid sexual harassment cases in the future . most bizarre world cup-related business idea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got any ivory coast ?
anyone who has ever been to a soccer game can instantly recall the atmosphere on match day .
the excitement , the anticipation , the adrenaline of the game itself , the agony and the ecstasy .
a breathtaking game stays with you always .
what you do n't want to have with you always is the smell of the perspiring sport drinker who was belching and slobbering all over you for the whole 90 minutes .
that leads us to believe that retired perfume maker ernst-adolf hinrichs of holzminden has never been to be a game in his life . while he has not exactly tried to recreate the stadium smell in his new range of scents , he has tried to capture the national identity of each participating country .
rejecting stale beer and sauerkraut in favour of freshly baked bread , the german scent is probably one of the best .
few would like to be stuck in a train carriage with someone wearing the dutch scent -lrb- cheese -rrb- or the italian -lrb- pizza -rrb- .
mind you the swedish perfume could be pleasant with its whiff of flat-packed furniture . most bizarre exhibition of national pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this better than painting your dog ?
pity poor simba .
the maltese terrier was happy being cared for in the lap of luxury somewhere in germany when he was stolen by an over-zealous group of host nation supporters .
not wishing to do any real harm to the pampered pooch , the germany fans soon returned simba to his owners albeit in a rather different shade than he was before he was taken .
in a world cup special edition of " pimp my pet " , the fans had painted the dog in the german national colours of red , black and gold . the incident , widely reported in the german press to such an extent that both fifa and the german organizing committee issued pleas for similar behaviour to be avoided , caused an outcry among animal rights groups .
one , european animal and nature protection , urged germans to do all they could to prevent such cruelty taking place again .
" no one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm , " norbert günster from the group stated .
the group recommended dressing pets in national costume instead .

for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling . for the better part of two years , over 80 million germans have been literally bombarded by an advertising blitz that has reached epic proportions .
it would be almost impossible for someone living in the country not to have heard about the world cup . tournament sponsors know this and have sent out an interminable advertising barrage .
mcdonalds and coca-cola aim at armchair coaches ; adidas at potential stars on the pitch ; mastercard at the cash strapped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be it sweet or sweaty , it has to be associated with the world cup the commercialization of the world 's most-watched sporting event , and soccer in general , over the past decade and a half has led to a counter reaction amongst fans . initiatives , demonstrations , and magazines have taken aim at functionaries like fifa president sepp blatter or germany world cup organizer franz beckenbauer , and are calling on fans to " reclaim the game . " security concerns abused many think the reclamation of the sport must start at the fan base .
since violence off the pitch often gains as much attention as the final score on it , fears that hooliganism may scar " the beautiful game " have led to security measures some feel are excessive , preventing fans from even making contact with each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody needs a shoulder to lean on - and a bed to sleep in the project " ein dach für fans " -lrb- edff -rrb- , or " one roof for fans , " was founded in dortmund in 2004 to " provide friendly , people-uniting contacts between german and soccer fans from around the world " .
for edff coordinator , peter schüngel , projects like these are necessary as a counterweight to commercialization , which he thinks has played a key role in fueling aggression between fans from other cities and countries . " wherever money is being made , it 's a law of nature that security will be optimized so that the process can continue , " the 54-year-old said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much security can actually cause tensions to boil over he is careful to add that when he makes such comments to the press , he does n't intend to sound like a leftist railing against capitalism .
schüngel admitted that soccer has profited immensely from commercialization , but he said there are limits as to how far security should extend to protect it . " the separation of fans leads to xenophobia .
with the roof project , we bring supporters together .
i ca n't but recall a saying from an englishman about soccer fans : ' we 're friends and rivals in a common affair ' , " he said . " eat the rich " the heads of the alliance of active football fans -lrb- baff -rrb- have minced no words in expressing their distaste for the overkill of corporate sponsorship at the world cup .
on their web site , baff turned the world cup mascot - the oversized , cuddly , but unloved lion goleo - into prolleo , a beer-guzzling , teeth-baring lion , escorted by a bottle of lager . prolleo 's raison d 'etre can be read on the back of his blue jeans vest : " eat the rich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo may be sweet , but for baff the lion symbolizes cold commercialization it is exactly money , or to be more specific , the need of supporters to have lots of money to view soccer matches , that drives baff .
vip areas , the world cup ticket lottery , and the privileges of sponsors have created a gap that leaves the " poor " fan standing on the outside , looking in . giving fans a voice the media hype regarding the world cup and the sport overall has left many a soccer supporter alienated .
it 's no longer about which team wins on the field .
the bonds between players and supporters have taken a back seat to the bottom line of wealthy owners , many of whom do n't come from the club 's city or even country .
russian tycoon roman abramovich , owner of london 's chelsea , or american billionaire malcolm glazer , who owns manchester united , are prime examples . the german soccer magazine 11 freunde -lrb- 11 friends -rrb- was born as a result of this fan-team deficit at the turn of the millennium . " i think the big problem at that time was that there was no publication where people could raise their voice against the commercialization of the sport .
we made it our goal to give the fans a voice , " said the magazine 's editor-in-chief , philipp köster . the 34-year-old pointed out that 11 freunde openly supports groups like baff without going as far as being a mouthpiece for them .
as a businessman trying to turn a profit , he knows 11 freunde walks a thin line between being called hypocritical if too many ads appear , and the alternative - closing up shop . for his publication , the world cup will be a chance to focus on the events that are n't in the spotlight .
the fans have been " worn down " by what köster called a " spectacle of commerce . "

-lrb- june 3 , 2006 -rrb- eleven friends and their love of soccer for the past five years , a scrappy fan-focused soccer magazine has been winning hearts in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.06.2006 " this is a german story " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann during his trial in jerusalem .
he was executed in 1962 in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 . the us central intelligence agency recently declassified some 27,000 pages of its operational records from the post-world war ii era .
at the time , the us covered up the identities of ex-nazis and used them as spies against the soviet union during the cold war . timothy naftali is one of four scholars charged by a us government panel called the nazi war crimes and japanese imperial government records interagency working group , or iwg , to examine and interpret the material . at a press conference earlier this week , he said records showed the cia and west germany had together suppressed the whereabouts of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in 1958 - around the time israel had given up searching for him for lack of clues .
the newly disclosed records also showed that the cia and west germany suppressed part of eichmann 's diary that could have embarrassed hans globke , the national security adviser to german chancellor konrad adenauer . globke had helped draft the nuremburg laws under the nazi regime ; under adenauer he was germany 's main liaison with the cia and nato . dw-world.de : what were some of the big surprises that came out of these cia docume n ts ? bildunterschrift : scholar timothy naftali says germans should demand more openness from their government timothy naftali : we came out with some information -lrb- in a look at previously released documents -rrb- in 2004 that showed the extent to which the gehlen organization -lrb- the prototype german intelligence agency set up by by the americans under richard gehlen , who had run military intelligence on the eastern front under the nazis - eds . -rrb- had recruited some nazis with criminal pasts .
the extent to which the us government did not exercise supervision over the gehlen organization came as a surprise to me . this time i found the information about eichmann very interesting , but not terribly surprising since i knew that it was n't us policy to follow eichmann . was it official policy to leave nazi hu n ti n g to the germa n s ? after the end of the de-nazification trials , it really was us policy to leave this to the germans . … it was part of recognizing german sovereignty . it seems clear that the cia a n d west germa n s we n t a lo n g way to try a n d protect ade n auer 's n atio n al security chief ha n s globke .
was it n ot k n ow n that he had bee n very active i n the nazi regime ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as th first post-war chancellor , adenauer evidently felt he had secrets to keep .
i ca n't explain the alarm that is evident in the german government , at least in the west german intelligence community , after eichmann was taken .
after all , globke at that point was the subject of a very public dispute with a man named max merten , who alleged that globke had participated in resolving the question of the jews of salonika , in greece . what could eichmann have added that would have altered globke 's position ?
i do n't know .
i can only report the alarm that is evident in the document . it is very difficult to do international history from one side … it 's a real shame that the german government refuses to release its information on these topics .
i do n't understand why berlin can not release the bnd -lrb- german intelligence agency -rrb- files on eichmann .
why not ?
i would be intrigued to see what the west german government had on eichmann and the decision making at the highest levels between adenauer and globke over what to do about eichmann .
that 's the great question . does it look like a n y more i n formatio n is comi n g dow n the pike from a n y of the wester n europea n players i n world war ii ? that 's not up to us .
our mandate is to declassify us government records , not the records of other countries .
i would assume that is something for the german press , german scholars , and german people to demand .
i find it interesting that when the us releases information about eichmann , it gets a lot of play in germany .
but there 's no follow-up with the german government .
after all , german scholars should be asking their government , " why ca n't you do the same ?
why ca n't you be as open as the us government ?
what are you hiding ? "
i mean , the cia is willing to release materials that make it look bad .
why does n't the bnd release materials to have an open history of its past ?
what is it afraid of ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftali asks : " why does n't the bnd release materials ? "
were you surprised by the coverage you received o n what was esse n tially a status report o n your research ? i found it remarkable that the press coverage of my particular piece focused on what the cia did n't do .
in fact , by the late 1950s , -lrb- hunting nazis -rrb- was largely a west german matter .
and i was surprised that the german papers did n't say , " why were we protecting this criminal ? " or , perhaps protecting is too strong a word .
why did n't they ask , " why were we happy to let him live in exile ?
what were we afraid that he would say ? "
this is not actually an american story .
this is a german story . iwg pa n el member elizabeth holtzma n said the docume n ts " force us to co n fro n t n ot o n ly the moral harm but the practical harm " of relyi n g o n i n tellige n ce from ex-nazis .
what co n clusio n s do you draw about usi n g tai n ted sources to gather i n tellige n ce ? the moral argument is well known .
but the counter-argument was always , " well these people are useful , and sometimes you have to make moral compromises . "
all i can say is : people are now welcome to look at the operational records of these tainted individuals , and they can come to their own conclusions about whether making the moral compromise was operationally useful .
and more often than not , these people were not productive . world war ii e n ded 60 years ago .
is it still importa n t to look at docume n ts about the nazi era ? it 's healthy for a society to have the tools to evaluate the performance of its intelligence community - even if the performance involves activities that are 50 years old .
and i would also hope that the intelligence community itself will take lessons from the past . timothy naftali is the director of the preside n tial recordi n g program at the u n iversity of virgi n ia 's miller ce n ter for public affairs .
his forthcomi n g book , co-authored with aleksa n dr furse n ko , is called " kruschev 's war : the i n side story of a n america n adversary .

a new information pack aims to give newcomers help on a range of issues , from finding a doctor to taxing a car .
the angus and tayside areas are seeing an increasing number of foreigners , many from eastern europe , moving to the areas to seek work .
last year more than 2,000 migrant workers registered with angus libraries to access internet and e-mail services .
the pack , available in english , polish , russian , czech and bulgarian will be distributed throughout the area at places such as health centres , police stations and churches .
labour shortages there are now an estimated 4,000 migrant workers in angus and the local council spearheaded the project to help the workers make a smoother move to the area .
we must ensure that migrant workers in our communities are not isolated through language differences or any other barriers bill middleton angus provost although migrant workers tend to be employed in more labour-intensive jobs such as fruit packing , many have university or professional trade qualifications .
businesses , who say they are vital for the angus economy , have welcomed the information pack .
local company strathmore foods has managed to fill labour shortages by employing eastern europeans .
its operations director elizabeth jackson said every company employee was a huge asset .
" all our workers have a strong work ethic and we are exceptionally proud of their dedication in ensuring particularly stringent standards when it comes to production , " she said .
' welcoming tradition ' the pack has received backing from several organisations , including regeneration agency communities scotland .
the organisation 's local area director sandy watson said research carried out by the agency found language problems were a major barrier to workers getting advice on local services .
" this welcome pack will go a long way to address this problem and ensure that those coming to work in the county are provided with the information they need to make their stay as enjoyable as possible , " he said .
angus provost bill middleton said the area had a long tradition of welcoming new residents into local communities .
but he added : " we must ensure that migrant workers in our communities are not isolated through language differences or any other barriers . "

the prince has enlisted classical british architect quinlan terry to work on designs for queen mother 's square in poundbury , near dorchester .
flats , social housing , shops , cafes and a small hotel are included in the plans as well as the possibility of a plaque .
the village has recently been criticised over its expansion plans .
a clarence house spokesman said : " the prince was very keen to name the next part of the development at poundbury after his grandmother as a fitting tribute to somebody he held very dear . "
mr terry said he was " honoured " to be involved in the project , which he said he began work on two years ago .
" it will be the central square in poundbury , " he said .
skyline ' dominated ' " people can meet there , shop , and have coffee in the centre of the conurbation .
that 's the thing that is so often lacking in these new towns and housing estates . "
the plans are expected to go before west dorset district council in the next few months .
other building work is already upsetting some residents of the village , which the prince conceived and built on land owned by his duchy of cornwall estate in reaction to modern architecture .
a blueprint for new flats was rejected by west dorset district council last year and again at appeal .
the new mayor of dorchester , robin potter , recently said large buildings " dominated " the poundbury skyline and views from maiden castle , a nearby iron age fort , were at risk by further building work .

marc bolland , chief operating officer of heineken , is taking the job , ending sir ken morrison 's 50-year reign .
sir ken will remain as chairman but mr bolland is thought to have insisted on complete executive control of the firm .
joining in september , he will lead a three-year programme aimed at getting the supermarket back on its feet .
sticking point mr bolland 's appointment comes just weeks after morrisons signalled sir ken would retire as chairman in january 2008 when he is due to become life president .
he has been under pressure to recruit a new chief executive after the company 's performance deteriorated in the wake of its 2004 takeover of safeway .
analysts believe that the role of sir ken , 74 , has proved a major sticking point in the appointment of a new morrisons boss .

the royal glamorgan in llantrisant has recently seen as many as one case a week , the bbc has learned .
users can develop muscle abscesses , and according to a registrar , each case costs the nhs on average £ 2,000 .
experts have also warned that users are becoming " sophisticated " and mixing them with other prescription drugs .
according to studies by the university of glamorgan , steroid use is common throughout south wales gyms . "
they 're all really bulked up , and you can see it 's from steroids " andrew penhale , gym user anabolic steroids are prescription drugs and are not illegal to use .
however , non-prescription supply of the substance is against the law .
side effects of misuse can include liver damage and decreased fertility .
the royal glamorgan said it had seen a steady rise in the number of patients hospitalised because of the misuse of anabolic steroids .
orthopaedic registrar peter kempshall said many patients needed overnight care .
he said : " people will go to great lengths to look good , and this is what this is - a substance that is designed to increase your muscle bulk and reduce your amount of fat and make you look good , so it is purely vanity . "
one anonymous 20-year-old user who was hospitalised by an abscess , said steroids were readily available .
he said : " it 's easy , really easy .
" you can get it from whoever - gyms , bodybuilders , whoever wants to make money .
" it 's quite cheap , you can get some quite cheap tablets - it depends what you want to do .
there 's different prices , depending on what you want to do . "
users are said to have become more sophisticated by mixing steroids with other drugs to force even faster muscle growth .
' sophisticated ' professor bruce davies , of the university of glamorgan , said usage was common across the south wales valleys .
prof davies said : " they have amazingly sophisticated approach to this , which i suspect is usually about five years ahead of most of the endocrinologists -lsb- specialists in glands and hormones -rsb- in this country .
" they are pushing large amounts of substance into the muscle too , so all those things , i think , add up . "
andrew penhale , aged 23 , said he was sometimes alarmed by what he saw .
he goes to a gym in trebanos , near swansea , where steroids are banned .
" go out to town on a saturday night , and you see them all , " he said .
" they 're all really bulked up , and you can see its from steroids and it puts a lot of people off going into the city , and also playing sport because it 's really unfair . "

he warned china would face a backlash in europe unless it did more to " apply rather than circumvent the rules " .
mr mandelson 's comments came during a visit to beijing for talks with his chinese counterpart bo xilai .
european and us firms have long complained about the volume of pirated goods on sale in china .
brussels and washington have also clashed with beijing over a number of trade issues in recent years , most recently accusing china of unfairly dumping clothing and shoe products on their markets .
this has led to both the us and european union tightening import quotas , although china insisted it was merely able to produce goods more cheaply and was being unfairly victimised by western protectionism .
' responsibility ' " the more the chinese door swings open and the world sees a responsible china playing by the rules , the more our citizens will be able to understand our shared interest in deepening our relationship , " mr mandelson told students at beijing 's renmin university .
he added that both the eu and china had to " commit to openness and resist protectionist pressures " .
despite a number of crackdowns by the chinese government , counterfeit goods are still widely available in china , ranging from pirated movies to fake branded clothes and copied medicines .

he warned china would face a backlash in europe unless it did more to " apply rather than circumvent the rules " .
mr mandelson 's comments came during a visit to beijing for talks with his chinese counterpart bo xilai .
european and us firms have long complained about the volume of pirated goods on sale in china .
brussels and washington have also clashed with beijing over a number of trade issues in recent years , most recently accusing china of unfairly dumping clothing and shoe products on their markets .
this has led to both the us and european union tightening import quotas , although china insisted it was merely able to produce goods more cheaply and was being unfairly victimised by western protectionism .
' responsibility ' " the more the chinese door swings open and the world sees a responsible china playing by the rules , the more our citizens will be able to understand our shared interest in deepening our relationship , " mr mandelson told students at beijing 's renmin university .
he added that both the eu and china had to " commit to openness and resist protectionist pressures " .
despite a number of crackdowns by the chinese government , counterfeit goods are still widely available in china , ranging from pirated movies to fake branded clothes and copied medicines .

the musical tones of the likes of oscar-winner sir anthony hopkins clearly demonstrated that melody , according to academic rod walters .
he found that a stereotypical welsh accent is set apart from others in the uk by how its pitch changes .
he decided on the study after returning from abroad to the university of glamorgan , south wales .
after research in rhondda workingmen 's clubs , dr walters found that welsh accents were rightly described as musical .
influences on rhondda accent welsh language english dialect of west country and west midlands ' cardiff english ' standard english source : dr rod walters the study found the main influences on the rhondda accent included the welsh language and some english dialects .
" a welsh accent is instantly recognisable , but there has been little research into identifying what are the actual sounds and cadences that make it so , " said dr walters , who is also a musician .
" its melody can be clearly heard , albeit in a refined form , in the speech of such newscasters as huw edwards , or the actors richard burton and anthony hopkins . "
during his research in the rhondda valleys he interviewed 60 men in workingmen 's clubs in treherbert , maerdy and porth .
" as any mimic of a welsh accent instinctively knows , its distinctiveness comes mainly from its intonation - the way a speaker 's pitch changes at stresses and at the ends of phrases , " dr walters said .
" while there are other british isles accents that have their own recognisable intonations , for example the glasgow , belfast , birmingham and liverpool accents , none of these are phonetically the same as welsh accents . "
listening to welsh accents from across south wales , dr walters found intonation patterns were similar , but with phonetic differences .
" cardiff is a little more gentle but the intonation in the valleys accent is more prominent , " he added .
in 2005 , the bbc launched its voices project , a uk-wide study of accents , including a look at how social history had affected the way of speaking .

clive wolfendale said " incessant " flag-waving in wales during the world cup could lead to racism and violence .
his comments were made during a launch of the force 's anti-violence campaign to coincide with the world cup .
clwyd west mp david jones said flags were " innocuous " and that mr wolfendale was " completely misguided " .
mr wolfendale , who is english , said there is a place for flag-waving during the world cup .
but he believes that in the weeks before the tournament , the sight of the english flag being displayed on cars " frequently and overtly " is " unnecessary " .
' in your face ' mr wolfendale said : " i 'm an englishman and i 'll be supporting england during the world cup campaign and if i was at the game or in and around the stadium there 's a fair chance i might be waving the flag .
" but i think there comes a point when weeks before the tournament the incessant use of these symbols is a bit in your face and i just wish people would sometimes reflect on the impact that 's having on others . "
clive wolfendale said overt flag-waving was " unnecessary " mr wolfendale said that in a football context wales was " definitely another country " adding that he wished england fans " would reflect on that before they start festooning their vehicles in this way " .
he said that displaying the flag was not illegal but that in wales it was a " matter of courtesy and of decent behaviour " for england fans not to do so .
he added : " there 's no doubt about it that this can be the precursor to behaviour which is much worse than flag waving - it 's violence , it 's racism , it 's hooliganism of the very worse kind . "
north wales police have launched a pub campaign entitled show violence the red card .
posters carrying the slogan have also been printed in polish and portuguese - two countries also competing in the world cup , and which have large communities in wrexham .
' completely misguided ' mr wolfendale 's comments have been criticised by some mps in north wales .
alyn and deeside mark tami said the remarks were not helpful and risk creating a problem " that is n't actually there " .
he said he does not believe that tension between english and welsh fans exists in north wales .

clive wolfendale said " incessant " flag-waving in wales during the world cup could lead to racism and violence .
his comments were made during a launch of the force 's anti-violence campaign to coincide with the world cup .
clwyd west mp david jones said flags were " innocuous " and that mr wolfendale was " completely misguided " .
mr wolfendale , who is english , said there is a place for flag-waving during the world cup .
but he believes that in the weeks before the tournament , the sight of the english flag being displayed on cars " frequently and overtly " is " unnecessary " .
' in your face ' mr wolfendale said : " i 'm an englishman and i 'll be supporting england during the world cup campaign and if i was at the game or in and around the stadium there 's a fair chance i might be waving the flag .
" but i think there comes a point when weeks before the tournament the incessant use of these symbols is a bit in your face and i just wish people would sometimes reflect on the impact that 's having on others . "
clive wolfendale said overt flag-waving was " unnecessary " mr wolfendale said that in a football context wales was " definitely another country " adding that he wished england fans " would reflect on that before they start festooning their vehicles in this way " .
he said that displaying the flag was not illegal but that in wales it was a " matter of courtesy and of decent behaviour " for england fans not to do so .
he added : " there 's no doubt about it that this can be the precursor to behaviour which is much worse than flag waving - it 's violence , it 's racism , it 's hooliganism of the very worse kind . "
north wales police have launched a pub campaign entitled show violence the red card .
posters carrying the slogan have also been printed in polish and portuguese - two countries also competing in the world cup , and which have large communities in wrexham .
' completely misguided ' mr wolfendale 's comments have been criticised by some mps in north wales .
alyn and deeside mark tami said the remarks were not helpful and risk creating a problem " that is n't actually there " .
he said he does not believe that tension between english and welsh fans exists in north wales .
clwyd west mp david jones said mr wolfendale 's comments were " laughable " .
he added : " i think it 's pretty innocuous -lrb- for fans -rrb- to display their flag from the little flagpoles on their cars if they want to do that .

the un 's mark malloch brown said washington did not stand up for the un against domestic critics and used the organisation as a diplomatic tool .
john bolton called the remarks " a very , very grave mistake " and called on kofi annan to repudiate his deputy 's speech .
observers say the row is linked to the possibility the us may withhold payment if the un does not reform management .
the organisation could run out of money at the end of june and the us might withhold its dues unless there is enough progress on reforms , the bbc 's laura trevelyan reports from the organisation in new york .
the row reflects the long-standing tensions between the un and its biggest paymaster , our correspondent adds .
' patronising ' the dispute was sparked by mr malloch brown 's speech on tuesday .
" much of the public discourse that reaches the us heartland has been largely abandoned to its loudest detractors , such as rush limbaugh and fox news , " he said in new york . "
even though the target of the speech was the united states , the victim , i fear , will be the united nations " john bolton depending on the un while tolerating " too much unchecked un-bashing and stereotyping " was " simply not sustainable " , he said .
" you will lose the un one way or another . "
un officials said the speech was intended as a warning signal about the looming budget crisis - but his comments drew a strong response from mr bolton .
he accused the official of employing " a condescending , patronising tone about the american people " .
he said he told the secretary general : " i 've known you since 1989 , and i 'm telling you , this is the worst mistake by a senior un official that i have seen in that entire time . "
" even though the target of the speech was the united states , the victim , i fear , will be the united nations , " he told reporters after speaking with mr annan .
a spokesman for the un chief said he stood by his deputy 's remarks , who said he had been appealing for engagement from americans .
" engage here , engage consistently and go out and engage with the american public to say the un matters , and for the life of me , i ca n't understand how that can be construed as an anti-american speech , " mr malloch brown said .
our correspondent says that with elections to the us congress due in november , un officials fear washington is calculating that bashing the united nations could secure some republican votes .

the durham university team say the discovery could significantly improve the yield of plants such as oil-seed rape , which can provide power and fuel .
they have identified a gene in the weed thale cress which can increase the production of starch and oil .
prof keith lindsey , of the university , described it as a " win / win situation " .
' expensive option ' he said : " increased dependence on motorised transport , diminishing mineral resources and increased global warming means that governments around the world are turning their attention to a range of alternative fuel sources .
" crop plants , such as oil seed rape , offer the potential for industrial-scale renewable energy supplies - vegetable oils can be converted to bio-diesel and starches to bio-ethanol , a petrol substitute .
" but land availability , demand on water and crop yields mean bio-fuels are still an expensive option - we believe we have found a way to make bio-fuels viable . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- reviving malaysia 's hi-tech dreams bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 8 june 2006 , 08:09 gmt 09:09 uk reviving malaysia 's hi-tech dreams by jonathan kent bbc news , kuala lumpur it is difficult to overestimate the impact that malaysia 's former prime minister mahathir mohammed had on his country during his 22 years in power .
arguably the most impressive of his achievements was to be among the first of the world 's leaders to grasp the potential of the internet , all the more striking because he was already 70 years old at the time .
it was back in 1996 that malaysia launched the multimedia super corridor , otherwise known as the msc .
" it was visionary , " says jeff ooi , a telecoms consultant and one of malaysia 's most influential bloggers .
the msc , now celebrating its 10th anniversary , was intended to tempt technology companies to malaysia to build on its growing success as a hi-tech manufacturing centre .
the government 's aim was to move the country up the value chain so that more people would be employed in the lucrative software and product development sectors .
" one , we had put together a impressive financial incentive package , " says mr ooi .
" two , -lsb- malaysia promised the -rsb- facilitation of easy flow of manpower ; three , to have a good infrastructure for investors that may come from all over the world . "
utopian vision malaysia wanted to create what badlisham ghazali , ceo of the body that runs the msc , calls " the silicon valley of the east " .
mr ghazali is still hoping to establish a technology " utopia " taking advantage of malaysia 's strategic location at the heart of east asia , its relatively low cost base and its linguistic resources .
looking out from his office in cyberjaya , the purpose-built tech city that has risen from the jungles outside kuala lumpur , he can point to the progress malaysia has already made .
as late as 2002 it was easier to get high-speed internet connections in kuala lumpur than in much of london .
but though malaysia was once way ahead of the curve in attempting to turn itself into asia 's technology hub , it has been slipping behind . "
there 's a big gap when it comes to the human resources supply from the local universities " jeff ooi , telecoms consultant " it was a unique proposition to the world 10 years ago , " admits mr badlisham , " but as you know since then the world has changed , there are many issues that have cropped up . "
he cites asia 's financial crisis in 1997/8 , the dotcom bust , as well as rival nations setting up other initiatives .
but events beyond malaysia 's control are only part of the story .
after all singapore , thailand , china , india and south korea all had to contend with the same problems and are pulling ahead of malaysia .
indeed , in the malaysian experience there are some clear lessons for governments hoping to nurture software and research companies .
" what went wrong was the devil was definitely in the implementation , " says jeff ooi .
" we have prohibitive immigration laws which makes an application for a working visa for expatriates so difficult .
" there 's a big gap when it comes to the human resources supply from the local universities . "
talent pool malaysian schools and universities are long on rote learning and short on original thinking .
they do not turn out the problem solvers and innovators tech companies need .
compared with china and in particular india , who can play the numbers game by churning out tens of thousands of graduates per year , malaysia 's talent pool is tiny in comparison .
then there was malaysia 's decision to only help companies within the multimedia super corridor geographical limits , odd when one of the internet 's great strength is its lack of borders .
" we are looking at msc like a supermarket , " says jeff ooi .
" we build it and people will come and the property developers will make some money . "
but perhaps the clearest indicator of the problems malaysia faces is to be found in the performance of local telecoms companies .
dhillon andrew of hack in the box , which organises the world 's largest hackers conference , says locals are looking enviously at their neighbours .
" in malaysia you can only get a one megabit connection as opposed to a four or six megabit just over the border and that 's really one of the main reasons you see the broadband adoption in thailand and singapore is shooting through the roof , " says mr andrew .
malaysia 's telecoms industry is dominated by lethargic government-linked companies .
there is precious little competition and no one seems to be prepared to take responsibility for the problem .
malaysia 's communications minister lim keng yaik declined to be interviewed .
his office told the bbc that the internet was not his responsibility .
the trouble is it certainly it is not anyone else 's .
open invitation so when mr badlisham tries to inject new life into a once world leading proposition , he is up against the " tidak apa " -lrb- do n't care -rrb- attitude of officials who should be his key partners .
but at least he has one powerful ally , the science and technology minister jamaluddin jarjis .
the cigar-wielding mr jamaluddin has a touch of donald trump about him , albeit with better hair .
he wants tech sector ceos to think of malaysia as their home from home in asia and just to underline that point he is rolling out the red carpet .
" my priority is to tell those boys come to malaysia , tell us what is the play and we will get all those resources in place when you come to town , " he says .
come to malaysia , mr jamaluddin is saying , and we will do our best to make a deal that reflects your needs .
we will train people for you , give you the infrastructure you need and make the numbers add up in a way that makes your accountants smile .
" we 're offering them a customised service , " he says .
" you tell us , you come to this country , you tell me what you like .
tell me what other countries are offering and we 'll see .
the same thing we did to dell and they decided to come here . "
there is no doubt that mr jamaluddin and mr badlisham want to revive dr mahathir 's vision of creating an asian silicon valley .
ironically though they may have a tougher time persuading malaysia 's government machinery and service providers to get with the programme than the movers and shakers of the tech sector .

the msc , now celebrating its 10th anniversary , was intended to tempt technology companies to malaysia to build on its growing success as a hi-tech manufacturing centre .

looking out from his office in cyberjaya , the purpose-built tech city that has risen from the jungles outside kuala lumpur , he can point to the progress malaysia has already made .
as late as 2002 it was easier to get high-speed internet connections in kuala lumpur than in much of london .

arguably the most impressive of his achievements was to be among the first of the world 's leaders to grasp the potential of the internet , all the more striking because he was already 70 years old at the time .
it was back in 1996 that malaysia launched the multimedia super corridor , otherwise known as the msc .
" it was visionary , " says jeff ooi , a telecoms consultant and one of malaysia 's most influential bloggers .
the msc , now celebrating its 10th anniversary , was intended to tempt technology companies to malaysia to build on its growing success as a hi-tech manufacturing centre .
the government 's aim was to move the country up the value chain so that more people would be employed in the lucrative software and product development sectors .
" one , we had put together a impressive financial incentive package , " says mr ooi .
" two , -lsb- malaysia promised the -rsb- facilitation of easy flow of manpower ; three , to have a good infrastructure for investors that may come from all over the world . "
utopian vision malaysia wanted to create what badlisham ghazali , ceo of the body that runs the msc , calls " the silicon valley of the east " .
mr ghazali is still hoping to establish a technology " utopia " taking advantage of malaysia 's strategic location at the heart of east asia , its relatively low cost base and its linguistic resources .
looking out from his office in cyberjaya , the purpose-built tech city that has risen from the jungles outside kuala lumpur , he can point to the progress malaysia has already made .
as late as 2002 it was easier to get high-speed internet connections in kuala lumpur than in much of london .
but though malaysia was once way ahead of the curve in attempting to turn itself into asia 's technology hub , it has been slipping behind .
there 's a big gap when it comes to the human resources supply from the local universities jeff ooi , telecoms consultant " it was a unique proposition to the world 10 years ago , " admits mr badlisham , " but as you know since then the world has changed , there are many issues that have cropped up . "
he cites asia 's financial crisis in 1997/8 , the dotcom bust , as well as rival nations setting up other initiatives .
but events beyond malaysia 's control are only part of the story .
after all singapore , thailand , china , india and south korea all had to contend with the same problems and are pulling ahead of malaysia .
indeed , in the malaysian experience there are some clear lessons for governments hoping to nurture software and research companies .
" what went wrong was the devil was definitely in the implementation , " says jeff ooi .
" we have prohibitive immigration laws which makes an application for a working visa for expatriates so difficult .
" there 's a big gap when it comes to the human resources supply from the local universities . "
talent pool malaysian schools and universities are long on rote learning and short on original thinking .
they do not turn out the problem solvers and innovators tech companies need .
mahathir mohammed backed the tech corridor compared with china and in particular india , who can play the numbers game by churning out tens of thousands of graduates per year , malaysia 's talent pool is tiny in comparison .
then there was malaysia 's decision to only help companies within the multimedia super corridor geographical limits , odd when one of the internet 's great strength is its lack of borders .
" we are looking at msc like a supermarket , " says jeff ooi .
" we build it and people will come and the property developers will make some money . "
but perhaps the clearest indicator of the problems malaysia faces is to be found in the performance of local telecoms companies .
dhillon andrew of hack in the box , which organises the world 's largest hackers conference , says locals are looking enviously at their neighbours .
" in malaysia you can only get a one megabit connection as opposed to a four or six megabit just over the border and that 's really one of the main reasons you see the broadband adoption in thailand and singapore is shooting through the roof , " says mr andrew .
malaysia 's telecoms industry is dominated by lethargic government-linked companies .
there is precious little competition and no one seems to be prepared to take responsibility for the problem .

arguably the most impressive of his achievements was to be among the first of the world 's leaders to grasp the potential of the internet , all the more striking because he was already 70 years old at the time .
it was back in 1996 that malaysia launched the multimedia super corridor , otherwise known as the msc .
" it was visionary , " says jeff ooi , a telecoms consultant and one of malaysia 's most influential bloggers .
the msc , now celebrating its 10th anniversary , was intended to tempt technology companies to malaysia to build on its growing success as a hi-tech manufacturing centre .
the government 's aim was to move the country up the value chain so that more people would be employed in the lucrative software and product development sectors .
" one , we had put together a impressive financial incentive package , " says mr ooi .
" two , -lsb- malaysia promised the -rsb- facilitation of easy flow of manpower ; three , to have a good infrastructure for investors that may come from all over the world . "
utopian vision malaysia wanted to create what badlisham ghazali , ceo of the body that runs the msc , calls " the silicon valley of the east " .
mr ghazali is still hoping to establish a technology " utopia " taking advantage of malaysia 's strategic location at the heart of east asia , its relatively low cost base and its linguistic resources .
looking out from his office in cyberjaya , the purpose-built tech city that has risen from the jungles outside kuala lumpur , he can point to the progress malaysia has already made .
as late as 2002 it was easier to get high-speed internet connections in kuala lumpur than in much of london .
but though malaysia was once way ahead of the curve in attempting to turn itself into asia 's technology hub , it has been slipping behind .
there 's a big gap when it comes to the human resources supply from the local universities jeff ooi , telecoms consultant " it was a unique proposition to the world 10 years ago , " admits mr badlisham , " but as you know since then the world has changed , there are many issues that have cropped up . "
he cites asia 's financial crisis in 1997/8 , the dotcom bust , as well as rival nations setting up other initiatives .
but events beyond malaysia 's control are only part of the story .
after all singapore , thailand , china , india and south korea all had to contend with the same problems and are pulling ahead of malaysia .
indeed , in the malaysian experience there are some clear lessons for governments hoping to nurture software and research companies .
" what went wrong was the devil was definitely in the implementation , " says jeff ooi .
" we have prohibitive immigration laws which makes an application for a working visa for expatriates so difficult .
" there 's a big gap when it comes to the human resources supply from the local universities . "
talent pool malaysian schools and universities are long on rote learning and short on original thinking .
they do not turn out the problem solvers and innovators tech companies need .
mahathir mohammed backed the tech corridor compared with china and in particular india , who can play the numbers game by churning out tens of thousands of graduates per year , malaysia 's talent pool is tiny in comparison .
then there was malaysia 's decision to only help companies within the multimedia super corridor geographical limits , odd when one of the internet 's great strength is its lack of borders .
" we are looking at msc like a supermarket , " says jeff ooi .
" we build it and people will come and the property developers will make some money . "
but perhaps the clearest indicator of the problems malaysia faces is to be found in the performance of local telecoms companies .
dhillon andrew of hack in the box , which organises the world 's largest hackers conference , says locals are looking enviously at their neighbours .
" in malaysia you can only get a one megabit connection as opposed to a four or six megabit just over the border and that 's really one of the main reasons you see the broadband adoption in thailand and singapore is shooting through the roof , " says mr andrew .
malaysia 's telecoms industry is dominated by lethargic government-linked companies .
there is precious little competition and no one seems to be prepared to take responsibility for the problem .
malaysia 's communications minister lim keng yaik declined to be interviewed .
his office told the bbc that the internet was not his responsibility .
the trouble is it certainly it is not anyone else 's .
open invitation so when mr badlisham tries to inject new life into a once world leading proposition , he is up against the " tidak apa " -lrb- do n't care -rrb- attitude of officials who should be his key partners .
but at least he has one powerful ally , the science and technology minister jamaluddin jarjis .

although the firm said in a statement that mr agut had resigned for personal reasons , the news has renewed takeover speculation surrounding the group .
reports have suggested in recent weeks that endemol 's parent firm , spain 's telefonica , wants to sell the business .
a group of investment banks are said to be interested in buying endemol .
telefonica floated a 22.3 % stake in endemol on the dutch stock market last november , leaving it with 75 % ownership .
resignation ' expected ' endemol said on thursday morning that it would seek to replace mr agut without delay .
analyst oskar tijs said : " we have always expected agut would resign if and when telefonica gives up control over endemol . "
telefonica gave mr agut , a spaniard , the top job at endemol two and a half years ago .
" the supervisory board and management board regret mr agut 's decision , but respect it and thank him for his valuable contribution and achievements , " said endemol .
the company has sold its big brother concept to 37 countries around the world .
endemol turned over £ 614m last year and income from big brother related activities is thought to make up almost 20 % of this figure .
