it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .
now uhrlau is the director of germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , and steinmeier sits in the foreign minister 's chair .
both are versed in the business of prisoner exchange , but whether or not they can now follow up on their earlier successes remains to be seen .
in times of open hostilities , such prisoners exchanges are much more difficult then they are in times of a truce , however shaky .
of course , it goes without saying that a strict silence is maintained about real and possible contacts . nice words , little progress foreign minister steinmeier 's predecessor , joschka fischer , also ended his term in office with an experienced hand in middle east diplomacy , but with very different results .
fischer visited the middle east more often than any other of the world 's crisis regions and exhorted both israelis and palestinians to make steps toward peace .
both sides tended to thank fischer heartily for his efforts whenever he visited , but then returned to their conflict as soon as his back was turned .
despite that , fischer did manage to put germany in the position to be able to talk to israelis , palestinians and even hezbollah without raising suspicions on all the other sides . but there is a long road between keeping various parties calm and being an active and successful mediator .
it is also one which is littered with many a failed attempt . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could lebanon crisis lead to a new trans-atlantic rift ?

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .
now uhrlau is the director of germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , and steinmeier sits in the foreign minister 's chair .
both are versed in the business of prisoner exchange , but whether or not they can now follow up on their earlier successes remains to be seen .
in times of open hostilities , such prisoners exchanges are much more difficult then they are in times of a truce , however shaky .
of course , it goes without saying that a strict silence is maintained about real and possible contacts . nice words , little progress foreign minister steinmeier 's predecessor , joschka fischer , also ended his term in office with an experienced hand in middle east diplomacy , but with very different results .
fischer visited the middle east more often than any other of the world 's crisis regions and exhorted both israelis and palestinians to make steps toward peace .
both sides tended to thank fischer heartily for his efforts whenever he visited , but then returned to their conflict as soon as his back was turned .
despite that , fischer did manage to put germany in the position to be able to talk to israelis , palestinians and even hezbollah without raising suspicions on all the other sides . but there is a long road between keeping various parties calm and being an active and successful mediator .
it is also one which is littered with many a failed attempt . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could lebanon crisis lead to a new trans-atlantic rift ?

he hopes to have one in place by 2009 . on monday , stoiber , who also leads the conservative christian social union , asked his justice and education ministers to work out a plan for a nationwide doping regulation which he hopes could be put into effect by the time the current government 's term ends in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while he may not do so , bodybuilders often use steroids to gain bulk stoiber decided to pursue the legislation after a spanish investigation saw german and italian cycling favorites jan ullrich and ivan basso pulled from the tour de france line-up shortly before the race began .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.07.2006 drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american tenor stephen gould is siegfried german playwright and director tankred dorst 's brand new production of wagner 's 16-hour " ring " cycle tops the program for the one-month festival and has critics on the edge of their seats . there is plenty of drama , both on and off the stage , at this year 's richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?
the curtain opens tuesday . tuesday 's gala features a performance of " the flying dutchman " , composed in 1841 .
the first of three complete performances of " the ring " begins wednesday with christian thielemann conducting .
" tristan and isolde " and " parsifal " will also be performed five times each during the month long festival . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein castle modernized for visitors the fairytale castle in lower bavaria has revamped its visitor program to allow more people access to eccentric king ludwig 's dazzling , larger-than-life vacation home .

but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .

but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .

" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .

wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .
he is the chair of a csu working group on the issue of gas station tourism and has said his group wants to study the issue before it evaluates the toll suggestion . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german toll tipped for expansion after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2006 germany has mixed record as mediator in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials have helped with prisoner exchanges several times germany has begun playing an active role in pursuing a diplomatic solution to the conflict between israel and hezbollah .
it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .
now uhrlau is the director of germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , and steinmeier sits in the foreign minister 's chair .
both are versed in the business of prisoner exchange , but whether or not they can now follow up on their earlier successes remains to be seen .
in times of open hostilities , such prisoners exchanges are much more difficult then they are in times of a truce , however shaky .
of course , it goes without saying that a strict silence is maintained about real and possible contacts . nice words , little progress foreign minister steinmeier 's predecessor , joschka fischer , also ended his term in office with an experienced hand in middle east diplomacy , but with very different results .
fischer visited the middle east more often than any other of the world 's crisis regions and exhorted both israelis and palestinians to make steps toward peace .
both sides tended to thank fischer heartily for his efforts whenever he visited , but then returned to their conflict as soon as his back was turned .
despite that , fischer did manage to put germany in the position to be able to talk to israelis , palestinians and even hezbollah without raising suspicions on all the other sides . but there is a long road between keeping various parties calm and being an active and successful mediator .
it is also one which is littered with many a failed attempt . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could lebanon crisis lead to a new trans-atlantic rift ?

" we call for an end to the violence and for an agreement that would allow an international force to be deployed , " french defense minister michele alliot-marie told a press conference held jointly with her polish and german counterparts after a meeting tuesday outside krakow in the southern city of wieliczka . as far as germany is concerned , defense minister franz josef jung said it was too early to say if the circumstances are right for german troops to take part in any forces sent to the middle east by the united nations or european union . " with or without german troops , the question of whether there is a peace mission will only come once there is a cease-fire , " he said most germans against sending troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans do n't want to see their troops here earlier this week , however , jung said germany " could not refuse " a peace mission under the auspices of the un and eu . jung is getting some support from other politicians in berlin regarding a possible bundeswehr deployment to the middle east , but 53 percent of germans said they were against german troops ' involvement , according to a poll in der spiegel news magazine . speaking for the trio , alliot-marie reiterated the importance of getting israel and hezbollah to lay down their weapons before the international community sends troops and described the type of mission she could envision . " this force can only intervene after such an agreement has been reached , " she said .
" the mission of the force should be explicitly defined , and it should be given significant equipment and legal means to do its job . " major parties to convene in rome alliot-marie also expressed serious concern for the situation in lebanon , where she said , " civilians are the main victims and the infrastructure has been seriously hit . " a larger , one-day crisis meeting of 15 countries as well as top officials from the un , the eu and the world bank in rome on wednesday will attempt to hash out an international response to the nearly two weeks of violence that has racked the israel-lebanon border . congo also on agenda in poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are in congo to ensure safe elections the german , french and polish defense ministers , whose countries are grouped in the so-called weimar triangle , also discussed the possibility of setting up a tri-nation " tactical group made up of 1,500 men , which would be operational by 2013 , " polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski said . they also discussed the role being played by soldiers from their countries as part of an eu force in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- , to help ensure security during the vast african state 's first elections since those held on independence from belgium more than 40 years ago . french , german and polish soldiers form the biggest contingents in the eu force in drc , which numbers around 2,000 soldiers . the eu force will provide back-up to the 17,000-strong united nations peacekeeping mission in drc known as monuc during the period encompassing the elections , the first round of which is due to be held on sunday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emergency middle east conference will push peace plan as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
" only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace .
personally i would be pleased if that force was basically european and if eu member states were available to contribute to it once it is approved by the united nations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuation operations are slowing down , officials said an international force , which many european leaders support in theory , is causing public flip-flopping in germany . after measured and rather vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . pleading for aid the offensive has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands of people refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland issued an urgent appeal for $ 150 million -lrb- 110 million euros -rrb- over the next three months to cover the basic needs of 800,000 people made homeless by the violence and criticized both israel and hezbollah for attacking civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is now trying to take the diplomatic lead " my position is very clear - the hostilities must stop immediately , " he told reporters .
" civilian populations are not targets .
that is against the law , humanitarian law . " he said both a cessation of hostilities and getting effective aid to vulnerable groups were " long overdue . " the overall amount of the appeal included a call by the un children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- for $ 23.8 million to help lebanese children who have borne the brunt of israel 's military onslaught .
egeland said the first un convoy of trucks carrying emergency humanitarian aid will leave beirut for the southern port city of tyre on wednesday .
another convoy is due for friday . egeland said he hoped the delivery of aid would continue " every second day " with the agreement of the israeli military , which has promised safe corridors for vehicles carrying aid supplies . stranded in the war zone as the bombardments continue , foreign governments have sent ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . as of monday night , at least 300 americans and europeans were still in the south of lebanon , missing a boat sent to rescue them .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .

egeland said the first un convoy of trucks carrying emergency humanitarian aid will leave beirut for the southern port city of tyre on wednesday .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?
the curtain opens tuesday . tuesday 's gala features a performance of " the flying dutchman " , composed in 1841 .
the first of three complete performances of " the ring " begins wednesday with christian thielemann conducting .
" tristan and isolde " and " parsifal " will also be performed five times each during the month long festival . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein castle modernized for visitors the fairytale castle in lower bavaria has revamped its visitor program to allow more people access to eccentric king ludwig 's dazzling , larger-than-life vacation home .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?
the curtain opens tuesday . tuesday 's gala features a performance of " the flying dutchman " , composed in 1841 .
the first of three complete performances of " the ring " begins wednesday with christian thielemann conducting .
" tristan and isolde " and " parsifal " will also be performed five times each during the month long festival . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein castle modernized for visitors the fairytale castle in lower bavaria has revamped its visitor program to allow more people access to eccentric king ludwig 's dazzling , larger-than-life vacation home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2006 emergency middle east conference will push peace plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the warring parties calm down under the auspices of rome 's wolf ?
as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuation operations are slowing down , officials said an international force , which many european leaders support in theory , is causing public flip-flopping in germany . after measured and rather vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . pleading for aid the offensive has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands of people refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland issued an urgent appeal for $ 150 million -lrb- 110 million euros -rrb- over the next three months to cover the basic needs of 800,000 people made homeless by the violence and criticized both israel and hezbollah for attacking civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is now trying to take the diplomatic lead " my position is very clear - the hostilities must stop immediately , " he told reporters .
" civilian populations are not targets .
that is against the law , humanitarian law . " he said both a cessation of hostilities and getting effective aid to vulnerable groups were " long overdue . " the overall amount of the appeal included a call by the un children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- for $ 23.8 million to help lebanese children who have borne the brunt of israel 's military onslaught .
egeland said the first un convoy of trucks carrying emergency humanitarian aid will leave beirut for the southern port city of tyre on wednesday .
another convoy is due for friday . egeland said he hoped the delivery of aid would continue " every second day " with the agreement of the israeli military , which has promised safe corridors for vehicles carrying aid supplies . stranded in the war zone as the bombardments continue , foreign governments have sent ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . as of monday night , at least 300 americans and europeans were still in the south of lebanon , missing a boat sent to rescue them .
still the majority of foreign nationals have been evacuated and french and german embassy officials said there were only a few hundred of their citizens left in the country .

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .
now uhrlau is the director of germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , and steinmeier sits in the foreign minister 's chair .
both are versed in the business of prisoner exchange , but whether or not they can now follow up on their earlier successes remains to be seen .
in times of open hostilities , such prisoners exchanges are much more difficult then they are in times of a truce , however shaky .
of course , it goes without saying that a strict silence is maintained about real and possible contacts . nice words , little progress foreign minister steinmeier 's predecessor , joschka fischer , also ended his term in office with an experienced hand in middle east diplomacy , but with very different results .
fischer visited the middle east more often than any other of the world 's crisis regions and exhorted both israelis and palestinians to make steps toward peace .
both sides tended to thank fischer heartily for his efforts whenever he visited , but then returned to their conflict as soon as his back was turned .
despite that , fischer did manage to put germany in the position to be able to talk to israelis , palestinians and even hezbollah without raising suspicions on all the other sides . but there is a long road between keeping various parties calm and being an active and successful mediator .
it is also one which is littered with many a failed attempt . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could lebanon crisis lead to a new trans-atlantic rift ?

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2006 german wind energy business picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've been generating more money lately , too for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .
but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2006 german wind energy business picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've been generating more money lately , too for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .
but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .
he is the chair of a csu working group on the issue of gas station tourism and has said his group wants to study the issue before it evaluates the toll suggestion . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german toll tipped for expansion after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .

" young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2006 german wind energy business picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've been generating more money lately , too for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .
but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
" only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace .
personally i would be pleased if that force was basically european and if eu member states were available to contribute to it once it is approved by the united nations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuation operations are slowing down , officials said an international force , which many european leaders support in theory , is causing public flip-flopping in germany . after measured and rather vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . pleading for aid the offensive has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands of people refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland issued an urgent appeal for $ 150 million -lrb- 110 million euros -rrb- over the next three months to cover the basic needs of 800,000 people made homeless by the violence and criticized both israel and hezbollah for attacking civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is now trying to take the diplomatic lead " my position is very clear - the hostilities must stop immediately , " he told reporters .
" civilian populations are not targets .
that is against the law , humanitarian law . " he said both a cessation of hostilities and getting effective aid to vulnerable groups were " long overdue . " the overall amount of the appeal included a call by the un children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- for $ 23.8 million to help lebanese children who have borne the brunt of israel 's military onslaught .
egeland said the first un convoy of trucks carrying emergency humanitarian aid will leave beirut for the southern port city of tyre on wednesday .
another convoy is due for friday . egeland said he hoped the delivery of aid would continue " every second day " with the agreement of the israeli military , which has promised safe corridors for vehicles carrying aid supplies . stranded in the war zone as the bombardments continue , foreign governments have sent ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . as of monday night , at least 300 americans and europeans were still in the south of lebanon , missing a boat sent to rescue them .
still the majority of foreign nationals have been evacuated and french and german embassy officials said there were only a few hundred of their citizens left in the country .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .
he is the chair of a csu working group on the issue of gas station tourism and has said his group wants to study the issue before it evaluates the toll suggestion . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german toll tipped for expansion after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .
he is the chair of a csu working group on the issue of gas station tourism and has said his group wants to study the issue before it evaluates the toll suggestion . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german toll tipped for expansion after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .

" young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .

here 's a little test .
you live in the western german state of north rhine-wesphalia and you need to transport a 1.5 meter -lrb- 5 foot -rrb- snake to an acquaintance in southern germany .
to do this you : a -rrb- put it in an escape-proof , animal-safety-approved carrying container in the backseat of your car and drive it to its destination ; b -rrb- put it in an escape-proof , animal-safety-approved carrying container , buy an airline ticket , and fly it to its destination ; c -rrb- stuff it in a package and take it to the post office , where you pay the postage -lrb- " would that be reptile rate ? " -rrb- then leave it on the counter , high-tail it for home , and hope everything works out ok .

post office workers noticed the package was wriggling , so they opened it .
out slithered the massive albino burmese python - and away ran the shocked civil servants , headed for the exits .
eventually , a keeper from the local zoo was called in to catch the snake .
police are now searching for the sender , who is likely to be charged with breaking animal protection laws .

but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2006 germany has mixed record as mediator in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials have helped with prisoner exchanges several times germany has begun playing an active role in pursuing a diplomatic solution to the conflict between israel and hezbollah .
it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .
now uhrlau is the director of germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , and steinmeier sits in the foreign minister 's chair .
both are versed in the business of prisoner exchange , but whether or not they can now follow up on their earlier successes remains to be seen .
in times of open hostilities , such prisoners exchanges are much more difficult then they are in times of a truce , however shaky .
of course , it goes without saying that a strict silence is maintained about real and possible contacts . nice words , little progress foreign minister steinmeier 's predecessor , joschka fischer , also ended his term in office with an experienced hand in middle east diplomacy , but with very different results .
fischer visited the middle east more often than any other of the world 's crisis regions and exhorted both israelis and palestinians to make steps toward peace .
both sides tended to thank fischer heartily for his efforts whenever he visited , but then returned to their conflict as soon as his back was turned .
despite that , fischer did manage to put germany in the position to be able to talk to israelis , palestinians and even hezbollah without raising suspicions on all the other sides . but there is a long road between keeping various parties calm and being an active and successful mediator .
it is also one which is littered with many a failed attempt . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could lebanon crisis lead to a new trans-atlantic rift ?

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .
now uhrlau is the director of germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , and steinmeier sits in the foreign minister 's chair .
both are versed in the business of prisoner exchange , but whether or not they can now follow up on their earlier successes remains to be seen .
in times of open hostilities , such prisoners exchanges are much more difficult then they are in times of a truce , however shaky .
of course , it goes without saying that a strict silence is maintained about real and possible contacts . nice words , little progress foreign minister steinmeier 's predecessor , joschka fischer , also ended his term in office with an experienced hand in middle east diplomacy , but with very different results .
fischer visited the middle east more often than any other of the world 's crisis regions and exhorted both israelis and palestinians to make steps toward peace .
both sides tended to thank fischer heartily for his efforts whenever he visited , but then returned to their conflict as soon as his back was turned .
despite that , fischer did manage to put germany in the position to be able to talk to israelis , palestinians and even hezbollah without raising suspicions on all the other sides . but there is a long road between keeping various parties calm and being an active and successful mediator .
it is also one which is littered with many a failed attempt . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could lebanon crisis lead to a new trans-atlantic rift ?

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
" only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuation operations are slowing down , officials said an international force , which many european leaders support in theory , is causing public flip-flopping in germany . after measured and rather vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . pleading for aid the offensive has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands of people refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland issued an urgent appeal for $ 150 million -lrb- 110 million euros -rrb- over the next three months to cover the basic needs of 800,000 people made homeless by the violence and criticized both israel and hezbollah for attacking civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is now trying to take the diplomatic lead " my position is very clear - the hostilities must stop immediately , " he told reporters .

" the overall amount of the appeal included a call by the un children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- for $ 23.8 million to help lebanese children who have borne the brunt of israel 's military onslaught .
egeland said the first un convoy of trucks carrying emergency humanitarian aid will leave beirut for the southern port city of tyre on wednesday .
another convoy is due for friday . egeland said he hoped the delivery of aid would continue " every second day " with the agreement of the israeli military , which has promised safe corridors for vehicles carrying aid supplies . stranded in the war zone as the bombardments continue , foreign governments have sent ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . as of monday night , at least 300 americans and europeans were still in the south of lebanon , missing a boat sent to rescue them .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
" only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace .
personally i would be pleased if that force was basically european and if eu member states were available to contribute to it once it is approved by the united nations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuation operations are slowing down , officials said an international force , which many european leaders support in theory , is causing public flip-flopping in germany . after measured and rather vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . pleading for aid the offensive has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands of people refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland issued an urgent appeal for $ 150 million -lrb- 110 million euros -rrb- over the next three months to cover the basic needs of 800,000 people made homeless by the violence and criticized both israel and hezbollah for attacking civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is now trying to take the diplomatic lead " my position is very clear - the hostilities must stop immediately , " he told reporters .
" civilian populations are not targets .
that is against the law , humanitarian law . " he said both a cessation of hostilities and getting effective aid to vulnerable groups were " long overdue . " the overall amount of the appeal included a call by the un children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- for $ 23.8 million to help lebanese children who have borne the brunt of israel 's military onslaught .
egeland said the first un convoy of trucks carrying emergency humanitarian aid will leave beirut for the southern port city of tyre on wednesday .
another convoy is due for friday . egeland said he hoped the delivery of aid would continue " every second day " with the agreement of the israeli military , which has promised safe corridors for vehicles carrying aid supplies . stranded in the war zone as the bombardments continue , foreign governments have sent ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . as of monday night , at least 300 americans and europeans were still in the south of lebanon , missing a boat sent to rescue them .
still the majority of foreign nationals have been evacuated and french and german embassy officials said there were only a few hundred of their citizens left in the country . " the evacuation operations are now down to a trickle , " a german official said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could lebanon crisis lead to a new trans-atlantic rift ?

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
" only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace .
personally i would be pleased if that force was basically european and if eu member states were available to contribute to it once it is approved by the united nations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuation operations are slowing down , officials said an international force , which many european leaders support in theory , is causing public flip-flopping in germany . after measured and rather vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . pleading for aid the offensive has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands of people refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland issued an urgent appeal for $ 150 million -lrb- 110 million euros -rrb- over the next three months to cover the basic needs of 800,000 people made homeless by the violence and criticized both israel and hezbollah for attacking civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is now trying to take the diplomatic lead " my position is very clear - the hostilities must stop immediately , " he told reporters .
" civilian populations are not targets .
that is against the law , humanitarian law . " he said both a cessation of hostilities and getting effective aid to vulnerable groups were " long overdue . " the overall amount of the appeal included a call by the un children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- for $ 23.8 million to help lebanese children who have borne the brunt of israel 's military onslaught .
egeland said the first un convoy of trucks carrying emergency humanitarian aid will leave beirut for the southern port city of tyre on wednesday .
another convoy is due for friday . egeland said he hoped the delivery of aid would continue " every second day " with the agreement of the israeli military , which has promised safe corridors for vehicles carrying aid supplies . stranded in the war zone as the bombardments continue , foreign governments have sent ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . as of monday night , at least 300 americans and europeans were still in the south of lebanon , missing a boat sent to rescue them .
still the majority of foreign nationals have been evacuated and french and german embassy officials said there were only a few hundred of their citizens left in the country .

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .
now uhrlau is the director of germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , and steinmeier sits in the foreign minister 's chair .
both are versed in the business of prisoner exchange , but whether or not they can now follow up on their earlier successes remains to be seen .
in times of open hostilities , such prisoners exchanges are much more difficult then they are in times of a truce , however shaky .
of course , it goes without saying that a strict silence is maintained about real and possible contacts . nice words , little progress foreign minister steinmeier 's predecessor , joschka fischer , also ended his term in office with an experienced hand in middle east diplomacy , but with very different results .
fischer visited the middle east more often than any other of the world 's crisis regions and exhorted both israelis and palestinians to make steps toward peace .
both sides tended to thank fischer heartily for his efforts whenever he visited , but then returned to their conflict as soon as his back was turned .
despite that , fischer did manage to put germany in the position to be able to talk to israelis , palestinians and even hezbollah without raising suspicions on all the other sides . but there is a long road between keeping various parties calm and being an active and successful mediator .
it is also one which is littered with many a failed attempt . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could lebanon crisis lead to a new trans-atlantic rift ?

his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
" only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace .
personally i would be pleased if that force was basically european and if eu member states were available to contribute to it once it is approved by the united nations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuation operations are slowing down , officials said an international force , which many european leaders support in theory , is causing public flip-flopping in germany . after measured and rather vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . pleading for aid the offensive has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands of people refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland issued an urgent appeal for $ 150 million -lrb- 110 million euros -rrb- over the next three months to cover the basic needs of 800,000 people made homeless by the violence and criticized both israel and hezbollah for attacking civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is now trying to take the diplomatic lead " my position is very clear - the hostilities must stop immediately , " he told reporters .
" civilian populations are not targets .
that is against the law , humanitarian law . " he said both a cessation of hostilities and getting effective aid to vulnerable groups were " long overdue . " the overall amount of the appeal included a call by the un children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- for $ 23.8 million to help lebanese children who have borne the brunt of israel 's military onslaught .
egeland said the first un convoy of trucks carrying emergency humanitarian aid will leave beirut for the southern port city of tyre on wednesday .
another convoy is due for friday . egeland said he hoped the delivery of aid would continue " every second day " with the agreement of the israeli military , which has promised safe corridors for vehicles carrying aid supplies . stranded in the war zone as the bombardments continue , foreign governments have sent ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . as of monday night , at least 300 americans and europeans were still in the south of lebanon , missing a boat sent to rescue them .
still the majority of foreign nationals have been evacuated and french and german embassy officials said there were only a few hundred of their citizens left in the country .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
" only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars .

he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2006 german wind energy business picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've been generating more money lately , too for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .
but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.07.2006 drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american tenor stephen gould is siegfried german playwright and director tankred dorst 's brand new production of wagner 's 16-hour " ring " cycle tops the program for the one-month festival and has critics on the edge of their seats . there is plenty of drama , both on and off the stage , at this year 's richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?
the curtain opens tuesday . tuesday 's gala features a performance of " the flying dutchman " , composed in 1841 .
the first of three complete performances of " the ring " begins wednesday with christian thielemann conducting .
" tristan and isolde " and " parsifal " will also be performed five times each during the month long festival . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein castle modernized for visitors the fairytale castle in lower bavaria has revamped its visitor program to allow more people access to eccentric king ludwig 's dazzling , larger-than-life vacation home .

but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars .

" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?
the curtain opens tuesday . tuesday 's gala features a performance of " the flying dutchman " , composed in 1841 .
the first of three complete performances of " the ring " begins wednesday with christian thielemann conducting .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .

but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2006 german wind energy business picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've been generating more money lately , too for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .
but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .
he is the chair of a csu working group on the issue of gas station tourism and has said his group wants to study the issue before it evaluates the toll suggestion . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german toll tipped for expansion after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.07.2006 drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american tenor stephen gould is siegfried german playwright and director tankred dorst 's brand new production of wagner 's 16-hour " ring " cycle tops the program for the one-month festival and has critics on the edge of their seats . there is plenty of drama , both on and off the stage , at this year 's richard wagner festival in bayreuth .
a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?
the curtain opens tuesday . tuesday 's gala features a performance of " the flying dutchman " , composed in 1841 .
the first of three complete performances of " the ring " begins wednesday with christian thielemann conducting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2006 german wind energy business picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've been generating more money lately , too for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .
but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2006 germany has mixed record as mediator in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials have helped with prisoner exchanges several times germany has begun playing an active role in pursuing a diplomatic solution to the conflict between israel and hezbollah .
it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .
now uhrlau is the director of germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , and steinmeier sits in the foreign minister 's chair .
both are versed in the business of prisoner exchange , but whether or not they can now follow up on their earlier successes remains to be seen .
in times of open hostilities , such prisoners exchanges are much more difficult then they are in times of a truce , however shaky .
of course , it goes without saying that a strict silence is maintained about real and possible contacts . nice words , little progress foreign minister steinmeier 's predecessor , joschka fischer , also ended his term in office with an experienced hand in middle east diplomacy , but with very different results .
fischer visited the middle east more often than any other of the world 's crisis regions and exhorted both israelis and palestinians to make steps toward peace .
both sides tended to thank fischer heartily for his efforts whenever he visited , but then returned to their conflict as soon as his back was turned .
despite that , fischer did manage to put germany in the position to be able to talk to israelis , palestinians and even hezbollah without raising suspicions on all the other sides . but there is a long road between keeping various parties calm and being an active and successful mediator .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
" only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuation operations are slowing down , officials said an international force , which many european leaders support in theory , is causing public flip-flopping in germany . after measured and rather vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . pleading for aid the offensive has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands of people refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland issued an urgent appeal for $ 150 million -lrb- 110 million euros -rrb- over the next three months to cover the basic needs of 800,000 people made homeless by the violence and criticized both israel and hezbollah for attacking civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice is now trying to take the diplomatic lead " my position is very clear - the hostilities must stop immediately , " he told reporters .
" civilian populations are not targets .
that is against the law , humanitarian law . " he said both a cessation of hostilities and getting effective aid to vulnerable groups were " long overdue . " the overall amount of the appeal included a call by the un children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- for $ 23.8 million to help lebanese children who have borne the brunt of israel 's military onslaught .
egeland said the first un convoy of trucks carrying emergency humanitarian aid will leave beirut for the southern port city of tyre on wednesday .
another convoy is due for friday . egeland said he hoped the delivery of aid would continue " every second day " with the agreement of the israeli military , which has promised safe corridors for vehicles carrying aid supplies . stranded in the war zone as the bombardments continue , foreign governments have sent ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . as of monday night , at least 300 americans and europeans were still in the south of lebanon , missing a boat sent to rescue them .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?
the curtain opens tuesday . tuesday 's gala features a performance of " the flying dutchman " , composed in 1841 .
the first of three complete performances of " the ring " begins wednesday with christian thielemann conducting .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .
he is the chair of a csu working group on the issue of gas station tourism and has said his group wants to study the issue before it evaluates the toll suggestion . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german toll tipped for expansion after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars .

everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .

" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2006 german wind energy business picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've been generating more money lately , too for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .
but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .

" young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?

a new production of wagner 's 4-opera magnum opus " the ring " , created in a mere two years by respected german playwright and director tankred dorst , has heightened anticipation at the month-long festival that opens tuesday . " the ring " cycle is 80-year-old dorst 's first dabble in music theater , though he 's a veteran of other staged genres .
everyone , from the janitor to the star soprano , is sworn to secrecy on what dorst 's production entails , though it is expected to take place in modern times and be less daring than recent stagings . wagner lovers worldwide are hoping that the 13th version of the 16-hour cycle to come out of bayreuth will offer a fresh interpretation and a radical new reading of the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bass-baritone falk struckmann rehearses for the wagner marathon " a good compromise " " based on the dress rehearsals , this year 's production exceeds the artistic standards of the previous years , " said arnold jacobshagen , a musicology professor from bayreuth university , who called dorst 's staging " a good compromise " between conservative and disturbing elements . inevitably , whatever comes across the stage in the three complete performances of " the ring " will be critically compared to 31-year-old patrice chereau 's 1976 version , which was at first harshly criticized but later acclaimed as an achievement " of the century . " jacobshagen said a comparison between chereau 's and dorst 's productions would be reaching a bit too far , but the musicologist and wagner expert predicted the latest " ring " production would be remembered in a positive light . last minute replacement dorst was asked to take over the bayreuth project when controversial danish filmmaker lars von trier suddenly backed out in june 2004 . von trier had already completed measurements of wagener 's purpose-built festspielhaus and thought through what would likely have been a dark production before he abruptly stepped down - leaving a few unanswered questions and adding a touch of mystery to the festival . he did give one hint to the reason behind his decision to leave , " due to my pathological tendency to perfectionism , it simply would have become hell , " die welt am sonntag quoted from von trier 's official statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tankred dorst well acquainted with other worlds dorst proved his capacity for large-scale , myth-based works with " merlin , " an eight-hour play .
his experience with the otherworldly lends itself to wagner 's masterpiece , which is based on teutonic mythology . " the ring " tetralogy consists of " rhinegold , " " the valkyrie , " " siegfried " and " twilight of the gods , " which tell the tale of a ring with special powers .
wagner first toyed with the idea of composing a work based on the old norse nibelungen saga in 1848 .
he finished the libretto in 1850 , but the four operas were n't completed until 1874 . a 130-year family tradition " the ring " cycle was first performed in its entirety in 1876 at the first-ever bayreuth festival , an idea conceived by wagner himself . today , 130 years later , the bayreuth festival is under the direction of the composer 's 86-year-old grandson wolfgang wagner .
wolfgang took over the reigns of the festival completely in 1966 after the death of his brother wieland , with whom he managed the annual event for 15 years . after four decades of control , some critics tend to blame him for " artistic stagnation , " as described in a recent süddeutsche zeitung magazin article .
according to the critics , wolfgang wagner has assumed the role of the monarch behind the stage and has had a difficult time relinquishing his leadership despite the pull of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director wolfgang wagner with his wife gudrun and daughter katharina nevertheless , he has been open to numerous avant-garde directors - like christoph schlingensief , whose iconoclastic version of " parsifal " will be performed five times at this year 's festival , and switzerland 's christoph marthaler , whose " tristan and isolde " will be revived on aug .
1 after its debut at the 2005 festival . " the word ' stress ' does n't exist for me , " he said in an interview with süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
" i do n't overestimate myself , and i know what i can and have to do .
but if someone comes up who is suited to take over the festival - why not ? " young blood and better singers it appears that " someone " will be his daughter katharina wagner , who is set to make her bayreuth festival director debut in 2007 with a production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg . " jacobshagen said it 's fairly clear that katharina will run the show at some point . " changes are desperately needed on the musical side , " the professor said , adding that bayreuth seldom gets the best singers in the business .
" to save money , the singers are n't paid according to international standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festspielhaus in bayreuth was constructed in 1872 though bayreuth is the only place in the world where wagner fans can see the entire " ring " within a week - other opera companies space the four operas out over several seasons - the quality of wagner performances is higher in new york or vienna , according to jacobshagen . the musicologist said he expects to see a considerable increase in ticket price within the next few years , which could give the festival more negotiating leeway with international stars . currently , the most expensive seat in the house on the legendary " green hill " costs 208 euros -lrb- $ 264 -rrb- , but the waiting list to get a hold of a ticket can run as long as 10 years . is it worth the wait ?
the curtain opens tuesday . tuesday 's gala features a performance of " the flying dutchman " , composed in 1841 .
the first of three complete performances of " the ring " begins wednesday with christian thielemann conducting .
" tristan and isolde " and " parsifal " will also be performed five times each during the month long festival . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein castle modernized for visitors the fairytale castle in lower bavaria has revamped its visitor program to allow more people access to eccentric king ludwig 's dazzling , larger-than-life vacation home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2006 emergency middle east conference will push peace plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the warring parties calm down under the auspices of rome 's wolf ?
as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis . "
italy , which has pledged peacekeepers , has said the rome meeting will aim to find " ways of arriving at a ceasefire , relaunching humanitarian action for the lebanese people and reflecting on how to stabilize the region , including through sending a multinational force . " israeli leaders , while warning that their offensive against hezbollah could last for some time , have suggested they would accept some form of international peacekeeping force in southern lebanon after meetings with steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice over the past few days . calls for peacekeepers growing the chorus in favor of an international peacekeeping force for the region is growing amid us and israeli acquiescence to the idea . " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
" only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace .
personally i would be pleased if that force was basically european and if eu member states were available to contribute to it once it is approved by the united nations .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .

as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward . foreign ministers frank-walter steinmeier and his russian counterpart sergei lavrov will attend an emergency conference on the middle east in rome on wednesday .
the meeting comes amid a diplomatic rift over the international response to the 13-day-old violence with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies . italian government sources told afp that israel could also be present at the high-level gathering , which will include representatives from britain , egypt , france , jordan , saudi arabia , spain as well as the united nations and the world bank .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit said he would use the meeting to demand an end to the fighting , which has killed more than 360 people in lebanon , along with at least 37 israelis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , has already made one trip to the middle east the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . in moscow , a foreign ministry spokesman said the meeting " should help to set out a timetable of urgent action to end the crisis .

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .
now uhrlau is the director of germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bnd , and steinmeier sits in the foreign minister 's chair .
both are versed in the business of prisoner exchange , but whether or not they can now follow up on their earlier successes remains to be seen .
in times of open hostilities , such prisoners exchanges are much more difficult then they are in times of a truce , however shaky .
of course , it goes without saying that a strict silence is maintained about real and possible contacts . nice words , little progress foreign minister steinmeier 's predecessor , joschka fischer , also ended his term in office with an experienced hand in middle east diplomacy , but with very different results .
fischer visited the middle east more often than any other of the world 's crisis regions and exhorted both israelis and palestinians to make steps toward peace .
both sides tended to thank fischer heartily for his efforts whenever he visited , but then returned to their conflict as soon as his back was turned .
despite that , fischer did manage to put germany in the position to be able to talk to israelis , palestinians and even hezbollah without raising suspicions on all the other sides . but there is a long road between keeping various parties calm and being an active and successful mediator .
it is also one which is littered with many a failed attempt . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could lebanon crisis lead to a new trans-atlantic rift ?

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .

it 's not the first time german diplomats have gotten involved in the region and this conflict . four years after israel 's 1982 march over its northern border , an israeli " phantom " bomber ran into serious trouble in the skies over southern lebanon .
the plane 's crew had to eject and in a scene worthy of a hollywood action film , israeli troops managed to rescue the pilot .
but the navigator , ron arad , could not be found . for 20 years rumors have circulated that arad was handed over to iran by shiite militias .
while iranian exile groups claimed to have traced him to various iranian prisons , the case was never actually solved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ron arad , israeli airman shot down over lebanon in 1986 and captured by lebanese guerrillas however , the arad case was one of germany 's first opportunities to intervene diplomatically in the conflict .
the then-coordinator of secret services in the chancellery , bernd schmidbauer , was able to benefit from what might have otherwise caused resentment in israel : good relations with tehran and the secret services there .
on jerusalem 's request , he began to look into the case . while no breakthrough was forthcoming , schmidbauer did manage to build positive relations with all the affected parties .
his greatest coup was the agreement he helped seal in 1996 .
it involved the transfer of the remains of two israeli soldiers who had been killed in lebanon 10 years earlier and the release of several members of the israel-backed south lebanon army .
in exchange , israel handed over the bodies of 123 hezbollah fighters and released 45 lebanese prisoners . layi n g the fou n datio n the case set the foundation for german mediation between israel and lebanon , or more precisely , between israel and hezbollah .
political mediation between the opposing sides , especially between israel and the palestinians , would have been beyond german diplomacy 's abilities .
but secret negotiations with technical goals , such as the exchange of prisoners , have proven to be a german specialty . the contacts german diplomats were able to establish also proved useful in 1992 with the release of two german aid workers , who had been held prisoner by a south lebanese family clan for almost three years .
seven years later , however , mediation efforts failed .
negotiators in 1999 tried to secure the release of five hezbollah fighters by israel and have them transferred to germany in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the missing navigator arad . the next opportunity came about in november 2003 .
with a one-vote majority , the israeli government decided it was ready to release about 400 palestinian and lebanese prisoners .
in return , israel wanted the remains of three soldiers and the release of a -lrb- dubious -rrb- businessman , who was in hezbollah captivity . among the lebanese prisoners who were granted their freedom were mustafa dirani and sheikh abdel karim obeid .
dirani is thought to be responsible for the capture and disappearance of ron arad .
obeid was a respected shiite religious figure .
both had been targeted for capture by israel in the hope of one day exchanging them for arad .
but without officially admitting it , jerusalem had apparently given up this aim and voted for their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau the exchange was made possible in 2004 by frank-walter steinmeier , who then headed the german chancellery , and especially by ernst uhrlau , who was the coordinator of secret services at the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2006 german wind energy business picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've been generating more money lately , too for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .
but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

here 's a little test .
you live in the western german state of north rhine-wesphalia and you need to transport a 1.5 meter -lrb- 5 foot -rrb- snake to an acquaintance in southern germany .
to do this you : a -rrb- put it in an escape-proof , animal-safety-approved carrying container in the backseat of your car and drive it to its destination ; b -rrb- put it in an escape-proof , animal-safety-approved carrying container , buy an airline ticket , and fly it to its destination ; c -rrb- stuff it in a package and take it to the post office , where you pay the postage -lrb- " would that be reptile rate ? " -rrb- then leave it on the counter , high-tail it for home , and hope everything works out ok .
apparently , a herpetologically challenged woman in the western german town of kommern thought " c " was the best answer .
but despite her ingenious effort , her prey - er , present - failed to reach its destination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did britney get hers by post ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2006 calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the free ride over ?
the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars .

the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism . " the bavarian interior minister 's suggestion , a 100-euro -lrb- $ 126 -rrb- annual windshield sticker that would be required for cars to travel on the autobahn , would enable the country to lower gasoline taxes , he said , and stop people from traveling over the border .
in the czech republic , for example , a liter -lrb- just over a fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gasoline can be up to 33 euro cents cheaper than the 1.38 euros paid in germany . " we have to reduce gas prices to an extent that a sticker would be cost-neutral for citizens traveling around 10,000 kilometers , " he told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . he added that it is estimated that " gas station tourism " and the failures of many gas stations in bavaria have resulted in tax revenue losses of between 4 and 6 billion euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein beckstein said the toll system would mean freeway maintenance in the future would be financed more by those who actually drive on them .
right now , he said , the government 's budget of 6 billion euros a year for highways is not enough . " we need annually from 1.5 to 2 million more , " he said . beckstein has found some support for the idea in günther oettinger , the premier of the state of baden-württemberg .
according to him , it is time to rethink the idea of a passenger car toll , something that surveys have shown is very unpopular with the german population .
still , he predicted there would be a parliamentary majority for the introduction of a sticker toll system in the legislative period beginning in 2009 . transportation ministry says no but german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee has rejected the toll calls , saying the toll system used for trailer trucks will not be extended to passenger cars . " a car toll is not up for debate , " he said .
" that 's also true for the time after 2009 , " the end of chancellor angela merkel 's term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticker shock ?
tiefensee has said the administrative costs of such a system would be higher than the new revenue it generated .
he said it would penalize commuters , who are already seeing reductions in tax breaks they enjoyed , or would prompt them to avoid freeways and bring more traffic , pollution and noise to populated areas . germany has the most extensive highway system in the eu .
the country introduced a satellite-driven toll for trucks last year to help with modernization costs , which provides an annual revenue of about 3.5 billion euros . but according to economics minister michael glos , a member of the bavaria-based christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a passenger car toll should not be ruled out .
he is the chair of a csu working group on the issue of gas station tourism and has said his group wants to study the issue before it evaluates the toll suggestion . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german toll tipped for expansion after the successful start of germany 's long troubled highway toll system for heavy commercial trucks , suggestions are already being made to expand the satellite-based technology to surface streets and normal cars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.07.2006 german wind energy business picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've been generating more money lately , too for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .
but wind energy is fast becoming an import export area as the global market continues to grow . once considered the realm of birkenstock-wearing nature lovers whose business savvy did n't extend much beyond the beads they might sell at the local crafts market , wind energy has come a long way .
in fact , these are boom years for the industry and new numbers out about its performance in 2005 and the first half of 2006 indicate that wind energy is on an upward trajectory , particularly when it comes to the export market . according to the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , the german wind energy sector is the world leader , making up about four billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- of the global industry 's 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- in sales . " for all of 2006 we 're counting on good results similar to those of 2005 , because of the booming export market , " said norbert giese , a wind energy expert with the vdma and director of siemens wind power gmbh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind turbines amid the sheep in germany according to the german wind energy institute -lrb- dewi -rrb- , exports of german-made wind energy equipment rose 55 percent between 2004 and 2005 to just under 2.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- .
of the wind energy equipment manufactured in germany , some 71 percent was exported in 2005 , up from 59 percent in 2004 . the biggest buyer of german exports is the us , where wind energy production is expanding .
while normally only rotors and turbines are exported , the us is also buying the supporting steel towers , since equipment manufacturing levels there do not meet current demand . domestically , however , sales decreased by 11 percent to 1.16 billion euros .
much of that has to do with unclear rules about the establishment of wind power facilities and protests from citizens ' groups about wind farms near their localities . healthy growth forecasts growth levels overall , however , look positive , especially in the wake of increasing energy insecurity , rising oil prices and environmental catastrophes that are thought to be a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
according to dewi , the percentage of energy generated by wind energy doubles every three years .
even though increasing numbers of countries , notably india and china , are building their own wind energy facilities , german firms still often act as suppliers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could become much more numerous on the landscape - although not everyone likes them in germany , there is still the worry that wind energy could never wean itself from the exports it still largely depends on .
and right now , wind energy accounts for just 6.8 percent of the german energy production , according to ralf bischof of the bbw wind energy association .
therefore , there is still some ways to go before wind energy makes a real dent in the need for energy production with fossil fuels . " at some point we 're going to see energy prices from wind energy and those from fossil fuels or other methods come together , " giese said .
" that 's not happening everywhere on the planet , but there are already regions where wind energy is cheaper than , for example , energy from a new natural gas plant . " natural limits another problem stems from the nature of wind energy , namely , nature .
germany can be a windy place , but if the winds die down over a period of time , that 6.8 percent of energy production will not be reached and other energy producers have to jump in .
that could limit the future expansion of wind energy farms , although wind energy advocates say germany has some way to go before it reaches that limit , which they say lies between 20 and 25 percent . the federal government has said its goal is to produce 20 percent of its energy needs through environmentally friendly methods by 2020 .
giese and bischof have called on the government to use its next energy summit , likely to take place in october , to put more resources behind wind energy production , such as removing barriers for offshore energy production in the north sea and baltic sea through the development of a publicly financed energy transportation network . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the future of renewable energies participants at the annual renewable energies conference in berlin discussed the future of sustainable energies and stressed the importance of guaranteeing uninterrupted service for the future generations .

the liberal democrats said 16 nhs trusts , running 28 hospitals , were facing " high pressure " .
they said services would be scaled back and hospitals might even close .
and a local government association survey of 55 councils in the areas affected by nhs deficits said some services had been withdrawn .
the health service finished last year more than £ 500m in deficit , with one in three nhs bodies failing to balance their books .
the problems have already led to jobs being cut , operations delayed and wards closed . "
health and social care and two sides of the same coin " david rogers , of the local government association but the lib dems are warning more drastic measures may have to be taken at the 16 worst hit trusts .
they analysed how deficits combined with government reforms introducing more competition in the hospital sector could affect 152 nhs trusts in england in the coming years .
the lib dems said nine of the 16 trusts were in london and the south east with nearly a quarter of the hospital network in the capital facing " strong pressure " .
the west hertfordshire hospitals nhs trust , which includes st albans city , hemel hempstead and watford hospitals , is facing the most problems , the research said .
the trust has warned that , if cuts are not made , a £ 100m deficit could be run up by 2010 .
frontline services lib dem health spokesman steve webb said : " despite ministerial denials , it will be patients who suffer from cuts in frontline services . "
the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- survey , compiled in conjunction with the nhs confederation , also revealed the pressure from nhs deficits was hitting social services .
some 55 of the 78 local authorities in areas with deficits replied to the poll .
seven in 10 councils said they had suffered because of the financial problems , reporting funding for joint nhs and local government projects had been withdrawn and that there was a " sharp increase " in the referral of patients who would normally have been cared for by the nhs .
the councils reported this had led them to withdraw services from people with low-level care needs and increase waiting times for social care assessments .
councillor david rogers , the lga 's social care spokesman , said : " health and social care are two sides of the same coin .
it is impossible not to cut services on one side without hurting the other . "
shadow health minister stephen o 'brien said : " despite the government 's repeated , barefaced denials of cuts to frontline patient services we see here stealth cuts to social services caused by the nhs deficits . "
but the government said local authorities were receiving extra funding to boost social services .
and health minister lord warner said the lib dems were behind the times as the overspends were being tackled in the worst areas with teams of financial experts being sent in to give advice .
" this helps trusts cut their costs and become more efficient - for example , doing more operations as day surgery and reducing the length of hospital stay . "

the liberal democrats said 16 nhs trusts , running 28 hospitals , were facing " high pressure " .
they said services would be scaled back and hospitals might even close .
and a local government association survey of 55 councils in the areas affected by nhs deficits said some services had been withdrawn .

the problems have already led to jobs being cut , operations delayed and wards closed .
health and social care and two sides of the same coin david rogers , of the local government association but the lib dems are warning more drastic measures may have to be taken at the 16 worst hit trusts .
they analysed how deficits combined with government reforms introducing more competition in the hospital sector could affect 152 nhs trusts in england in the coming years .
the lib dems said nine of the 16 trusts were in london and the south east with nearly a quarter of the hospital network in the capital facing " strong pressure " .
the west hertfordshire hospitals nhs trust , which includes st albans city , hemel hempstead and watford hospitals , is facing the most problems , the research said .
the trust has warned that , if cuts are not made , a £ 100m deficit could be run up by 2010 .
frontline services lib dem health spokesman steve webb said : " despite ministerial denials , it will be patients who suffer from cuts in frontline services . "
the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- survey , compiled in conjunction with the nhs confederation , also revealed the pressure from nhs deficits was hitting social services .
some 55 of the 78 local authorities in areas with deficits replied to the poll .
seven in 10 councils said they had suffered because of the financial problems , reporting funding for joint nhs and local government projects had been withdrawn and that there was a " sharp increase " in the referral of patients who would normally have been cared for by the nhs .
the councils reported this had led them to withdraw services from people with low-level care needs and increase waiting times for social care assessments .
councillor david rogers , the lga 's social care spokesman , said : " health and social care are two sides of the same coin .
it is impossible not to cut services on one side without hurting the other . "
shadow health minister stephen o 'brien said : " despite the government 's repeated , barefaced denials of cuts to frontline patient services we see here stealth cuts to social services caused by the nhs deficits . "
but the government said local authorities were receiving extra funding to boost social services .
and health minister lord warner said the lib dems were behind the times as the overspends were being tackled in the worst areas with teams of financial experts being sent in to give advice .
" this helps trusts cut their costs and become more efficient - for example , doing more operations as day surgery and reducing the length of hospital stay . "

he was one of the army officers who had taken part in the coup which overthrew the country 's british-backed monarchy in 1952 .
the arab response to the new military regime , writes historian rashid khalidi , was at first lukewarm .
" suez changed this , firmly establishing nasser as the pre-eminent arab leader until the end of his life , and arab nationalism as the leading arab ideology . "
taking control of the canal was an act of national self-assertion - and defiance of britain - which electrified arabs everywhere .
nasser was seen as a new breed of ruler ready to stand up to the old colonial order .
by the time the suez crisis had run its course - and britain and france had been forced to make a humiliating withdrawal from egyptian territory - his regional position had become unassailable .
the dream of arabism arab nationalism , or " arabism " , embodied the idea that all arabs from morocco to the gulf should unite in a single state .
it was an illusion , but a potent one .
nasser 's life born in 1918 , the son of a postal clerk graduate of military academy , promoted to colonel in 1950 led the free officers in 1952 in a coup that seized power by toppling the british-backed monarchy elected president in 1956 and nationalised the suez canal shortly after resigned after arab defeats of 1967 , but popular demonstrations brought him back to power died of a heart attack in 1970 during the heyday of nasser 's influence in the 1950s and 1960s , the idea that the arabs should join together under egyptian leadership became very popular .
using the new medium of the transistor radio , nasser spread the arabist message into the most remote corners of the region .
leaders tainted by their association with the former colonial powers found themselves seriously undermined .
two years after the suez affair , the british-backed iraqi monarchy was overthrown in a bloody coup .
this sent a strong signal that arab nationalists were now in the driving seat .
the young king hussein of jordan , derided by nationalists as a puppet of the british , survived on his throne - but only by the skin of his teeth .
the israel issue with nasser 's ascendancy , three ideas came to dominate arab politics : arabism , social justice and the struggle against israel .
by allying itself with britain and france in the suez affair , israel confirmed the arabs in their view that it was the creation of colonialism .
the struggle against israel became the predominant arab cause , but it also in the end contributed to nasser 's undoing .
some analysts think his success in 1956 led him to overplay his hand in the june war of 1967 .
the egyptian leader thought the big powers would come to his rescue , as the us had done in 1956 .
instead , israel defeated the arab armies in a mere six days .
worn out from a succession of regional crises , nasser died of a heart attack in 1970 .
for many arabs , the light of arabism had been extinguished .

betonsports said the decision to end david carruthers ' contract was " as a consequence of -lrb- his -rrb- continued detention by us authorities . "
he was arrested last week as part of a us move to tackle internet gaming .
the 48-year-old is in a missouri prison after earlier waiving his right to a bail hearing .

it added it had been unable to speak directly with mr carruthers , who was named along with 11 other people and three other companies in a federal indictment .

gambling is illegal in many parts of the us , but internet gaming firms have hundreds of thousands of us customers as they are based offshore in countries that allow gambling and so were viewed as out of reach of us laws .
however , the us government believes internet gambling violates a law against placing interstate bets using telephone lines .
betonsports estimates it has 1.2 million online gamblers worldwide , and says the us online gaming market is worth $ 12bn -lrb- £ 6.4bn -rrb- in annual business .

five dogs have been admitted with canine parvo virus to the rspca bristol clinic in st philips in the last month .
vets at the nearby pdsa clinic have also reported a significant rise in cases of the illness .
the virus causes vomiting and diarrhoea in dogs and can occasionally damage the heart muscle .
not vaccinating is a false economy and is neglectful damian pacini , veterinary surgeon senior veterinary surgeon damian pacini said : " people often get a new puppy but then fail to get it vaccinated - usually at eight weeks old .
" come the summer , when dogs are spending more time on walks and outdoors , we see a rise in parvo in these unvaccinated animals .

lord falconer said the human rights act should not be scrapped , but measures were needed to ensure it was used in a commonsense way to protect the public .
public bodies should not be " unduly cautious " over human rights , he said .
anger was sparked after it emerged convicted rapist anthony rice , who killed naomi bryant , was freed because of concerns over his human rights .
rights ' distractions ' the european convention on human rights was incorporated into british law in 2000 through the human rights act .
the conservatives and other critics say this has caused huge legal problems , with the rights of criminals put ahead of the rights of the law-abiding majority .
lord falconer said a government review of the human rights act had concluded the laws had not affected fighting crime and had brought benefits to policy making .
but there were cases - the best example being killer anthony rice - where the " officials involved may have been distracted by human rights arguments in releasing him into the community when he was not safe to go there " , he said .
" we need to focus on issues like that , not by repealing the human rights act or indeed the convention or leaving the convention but by making sure it 's properly implemented . "
there would be better training and guidance about the human rights act and a group of ministers would make sure it was used properly , said lord falconer .
some laws , including those involving police and parole officers , would also be reviewed to make sure they made protecting the public a priority , he said .
hijackers case earlier this year , tony blair appeared to signal the human rights laws could be changed after a court said nine afghans who hijacked a plane to britain could not be deported .
the prime minister called the judgement an " abuse of common sense " .
lord falconer said the latest changes would not affect the hijackers ' case .
but the uk was joining other nations in challenging a ruling made in the european court of human rights in 1996 - on which the hijackers ' ruling was based .
they are trying to overturn the case of sikh militant karamjit singh chahal , where strasbourg judges said the risk that a suspected terrorist might be tortured abroad if deported could not be balanced against the risk to a country if he were allowed to stay .

dumfries and galloway came last out of scotland 's eight police forces , with seven of 187 rapes reported since 1996 resulting in convictions .
in 2004/05 , none of the 20 reported rapes in the area led to a conviction .
dumfries and galloway police said it hoped a crown office review would assist with the prosecution of rape .
iraina mcgroarty , director of the dumfries-based centre , told the bbc scotland news website the figures were " surprising , distressing and quite shocking " .
they revealed a 3.7 % conviction rate in the area since 1996 , lower than the current national rate of 4.3 % .
this is a difficult area where evidence is not always clear or easy to gather dumfries and galloway police " these figures must n't put women off reporting rape to the police , " she said .
" any decisions women make to come forward have to be based on factors in their own life and not influenced by something like this . "
mrs mcgroarty said a fifth of the centre 's caseload dealt with recent reported rapes and 80 % related to those in the past .
" i am sure the police statistics would mirror ours , " she said .
" therefore these cases are always going to be hard to find evidence for because of the exactitude of the legal system and the need for two bits of corroborative evidence . "
mrs mcgroarty said she was not optimistic that a review of how rapes are investigated and prosecuted , which was announced last month , would alter the conviction rate .
' traumatic experience ' " i think there are some good things that will come out of the review , such as the extension of the definition of rape and the fact it will encompass men , " she said .
" but it seems to me that it all pivots on the need for two bits of corroborative evidence .
" until that changes , i 'm not sure conviction rate will dramatically change . "
a dumfries and galloway police spokesperson said : " this is a difficult area where evidence is not always clear or easy to gather .
" the crown office recently completed a review of the approach to investigating rape and we hope that any changes will assist with the investigation , reporting and prosecution of this type of crime .
" women who are assaulted or raped are very vulnerable and i would like to assure them that when they report such a crime to this force they will be dealt with by professional , highly trained officers who will treat them with respect throughout what is a traumatic experience .
" these officers work closely with support agencies to ensure that the strain of the experience is minimised . "
' sufficient evidence ' a crown office spokesman said it was not valid to try to calculate a conviction rate from the number of cases reported , rather than the number of cases prosecuted .
" prosecutors can only take a case to court where there is sufficient evidence in law , and it is then for the jury to decide whether to convict or acquit the accused , " he said .
" where we do prosecute for rape there is a conviction in 35 % of cases .
" all decisions to prosecute are taken by senior lawyers in edinburgh , who also prosecute the cases in the high court , so any suggestion of regional variation is also invalid . "

" i am sure the police statistics would mirror ours , " she said .
" therefore these cases are always going to be hard to find evidence for because of the exactitude of the legal system and the need for two bits of corroborative evidence . "
mrs mcgroarty said she was not optimistic that a review of how rapes are investigated and prosecuted , which was announced last month , would alter the conviction rate .
' traumatic experience ' " i think there are some good things that will come out of the review , such as the extension of the definition of rape and the fact it will encompass men , " she said .
" but it seems to me that it all pivots on the need for two bits of corroborative evidence .
" until that changes , i 'm not sure conviction rate will dramatically change . "
a dumfries and galloway police spokesperson said : " this is a difficult area where evidence is not always clear or easy to gather .
" the crown office recently completed a review of the approach to investigating rape and we hope that any changes will assist with the investigation , reporting and prosecution of this type of crime .
" women who are assaulted or raped are very vulnerable and i would like to assure them that when they report such a crime to this force they will be dealt with by professional , highly trained officers who will treat them with respect throughout what is a traumatic experience .
" these officers work closely with support agencies to ensure that the strain of the experience is minimised . "
' sufficient evidence ' a crown office spokesman said it was not valid to try to calculate a conviction rate from the number of cases reported , rather than the number of cases prosecuted .
" prosecutors can only take a case to court where there is sufficient evidence in law , and it is then for the jury to decide whether to convict or acquit the accused , " he said .
" where we do prosecute for rape there is a conviction in 35 % of cases .
" all decisions to prosecute are taken by senior lawyers in edinburgh , who also prosecute the cases in the high court , so any suggestion of regional variation is also invalid . "

researchers at the university of dundee have uncovered a link between cystic fibrosis , cancer , diabetes and obesity .
cystic fibrosis -lrb- cf -rrb- is a genetic disease that affects organs by clogging them with a thick sticky mucus .
dr anil mehta said the findings could improve the effectiveness of treatment for patients who suffer from the diseases .
cystic fibrosis disrupts the way the digestive and respiratory systems work .
it prevents the pancreas from playing its vital role in helping to break down food .
the disease affects mainly children and young people and a baby can only develop it if it inherits two copies of the faulty gene , one from each parent .
our research has uncovered genetic links , through this cellular fat controller , which we believe lead to these differences in fat metabolism and cancer dr anil mehta university of dundee dr mehta 's research team studied the relationship between three cancer-related enzymes associated with diabetes -lrb- ndpk -rrb- , fat metabolism -lrb- ampk -rrb- and cystic fibrosis -lrb- cftr -rrb- .
they discovered a new pathway between the cancer and fat metabolism enzymes , which they have dubbed the " fat controller " .
these enzymes also bind to a protein that causes cystic fibrosis .
the researchers believe their work could have a significant impact on treatment of cystic fibrosis , adult-onset diabetes and some forms of childhood cancer .
weight loss dr mehta , who has worked in cystic fibrosis research for 20 years , said the findings were an important step in producing more effective treatment for patients .
" it has long been known that cystic fibrosis patients suffer significant variations in weight - they tend to be very thin and can suffer very fast weight loss when they fall ill , but we did not know why this was the case , " he said .
" similarly , it has been known that cf patients suffer a higher rate of cancer than normal and again we did not know why .
" in equal measure , almost half of these patients develop an unusual form of diabetes .
the smallest move makes such a big difference to our lives shona parlane mother of cf patient " what our research has uncovered are the genetic links , through this cellular fat controller , which we believe lead to these differences in fat metabolism and cancer .
furthermore , there are also significant links here to diabetes . "
dr mehta said the findings could have an important impact on future treatment and patients ' life expectancy .
the breakthrough offers hope for cystic fibrosis sufferers like 12-year-old ashley parlane , who attends tayside children 's hospital every two months for treatment .
her mother shona said she was encouraged by dr mehta 's findings .
" the smallest move makes such a big difference to our lives , " she said .
" emotionally , physically and in every other way it brightens up your day thinking that something could be round the corner . "
