virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .
they say an airlift of the material to russia would be irresponsible . " we can not understand at all why this transport of highly-enriched uranium should be carried out by airplane , " said tobias münchmeyer , a nuclear expert working for greenpeace germany .
" this is irresponsible because it is much more dangerous than by rail . " " without a doubt it will provoke strong protests , " he added . the material is waste from a research reactor that was built by the soviet union in east germany .
the reactor is currently being torn down , and its spent fuel rods are now to be reprocessed in russia . " absolutely safe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel transporting the waste by plane will make it vulnerable to attacks in spite of the protests , german nuclear authorities this week gave the green light for the airlift , saying the transport in a special russian cargo plane was absolutely safe . but activists reject transports of nuclear waste across borders . " we believe that every country with a nuclear industry should keep the nuclear waste it creates within its own borders , " said münchmeyer .
" that is why the german material must remain at the reactor site until a solution to the problem of final storage in germany has been found . " the recovery of the uranium is part of a joint russian-american program in cooperation with a united nations nuclear watchdog called global threat reduction initiative .
its aim is to find , secure and recover dangerous nuclear materials around the world to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists . german authorities said the precise day of the transport will not be disclosed , adding , however , that this was not because of a fear of violent protests . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .
they say an airlift of the material to russia would be irresponsible . " we can not understand at all why this transport of highly-enriched uranium should be carried out by airplane , " said tobias münchmeyer , a nuclear expert working for greenpeace germany .
" this is irresponsible because it is much more dangerous than by rail . " " without a doubt it will provoke strong protests , " he added . the material is waste from a research reactor that was built by the soviet union in east germany .
the reactor is currently being torn down , and its spent fuel rods are now to be reprocessed in russia . " absolutely safe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel transporting the waste by plane will make it vulnerable to attacks in spite of the protests , german nuclear authorities this week gave the green light for the airlift , saying the transport in a special russian cargo plane was absolutely safe . but activists reject transports of nuclear waste across borders . " we believe that every country with a nuclear industry should keep the nuclear waste it creates within its own borders , " said münchmeyer .
" that is why the german material must remain at the reactor site until a solution to the problem of final storage in germany has been found . " the recovery of the uranium is part of a joint russian-american program in cooperation with a united nations nuclear watchdog called global threat reduction initiative .
its aim is to find , secure and recover dangerous nuclear materials around the world to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists . german authorities said the precise day of the transport will not be disclosed , adding , however , that this was not because of a fear of violent protests . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

" we must recognize the fact that there is no end to human rights violations in sight , " lochbihler said .
" the us congress recently passed a bill that again introduces military courts which should clearly operate below international legal standards .
the bill also allows interrogation methods that should be clearly labeled as torture . " germany will assume the presidency over the european union on jan .
1 .
it has so far made no indications that it plans to focus on human rights during the six months it will be charged with conducting the eu 's business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lochbihler expects more from germany and the eu for amnesty international , this is a problem - especially in view of the human rights violations that have been taking place under the umbrella of the fight against terror . no sign of closure a thorn in the eye of many human rights organizations is the us-run prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
controversial since its establishment , the camp has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
eu lawmakers and civil rights campaigners have for a long time called on us officials to close the facility . " in guantanamo , new buildings are being built , for example for these military courts .
there is no sign that it 's going to get closed , " lochbihler said . the role of germany 's government officials and intelligence services in the fight against terror must , according to amnesty international , be clarified .
especially , in those cases , in which there are indications that human rights violations may have been planned on german soil - in the us army european headquarters in stuttgart-vaihingen , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us army patch barracks in stuttgart-vaihingen " it is also not clear what the government knew about the abduction of mr. el masri , " lochbihler said . who knew what ? in 2003 , the cia abducted german national khaled el masri in macedonia and flew him to afghanistan where he was detained for five months as a terror suspect and allegedly mistreated .
us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . a german parliamentary committee has been investigating berlin 's role during the iraq war , the cia 's kidnapping of el masri as well as the cia 's secret flights and detention centers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el masri -lrb- left -rrb- was kidnapped by cia agents former german foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor frank-walter steinmeier are expected to testify before the committee on dec .
14 . " i expect the government to take concrete measures that such abductions never take place again , " lochbihler said .
" and to give clear instructions to intelligence services that nobody should use or participate in torture . " amnesty international has announced it will present a memorandum on germany 's eu presidency on jan .

" we must recognize the fact that there is no end to human rights violations in sight , " lochbihler said .
" the us congress recently passed a bill that again introduces military courts which should clearly operate below international legal standards .
the bill also allows interrogation methods that should be clearly labeled as torture . " germany will assume the presidency over the european union on jan .
1 .
it has so far made no indications that it plans to focus on human rights during the six months it will be charged with conducting the eu 's business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lochbihler expects more from germany and the eu for amnesty international , this is a problem - especially in view of the human rights violations that have been taking place under the umbrella of the fight against terror . no sign of closure a thorn in the eye of many human rights organizations is the us-run prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
controversial since its establishment , the camp has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
eu lawmakers and civil rights campaigners have for a long time called on us officials to close the facility . " in guantanamo , new buildings are being built , for example for these military courts .
there is no sign that it 's going to get closed , " lochbihler said . the role of germany 's government officials and intelligence services in the fight against terror must , according to amnesty international , be clarified .
especially , in those cases , in which there are indications that human rights violations may have been planned on german soil - in the us army european headquarters in stuttgart-vaihingen , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us army patch barracks in stuttgart-vaihingen " it is also not clear what the government knew about the abduction of mr. el masri , " lochbihler said . who knew what ? in 2003 , the cia abducted german national khaled el masri in macedonia and flew him to afghanistan where he was detained for five months as a terror suspect and allegedly mistreated .
us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . a german parliamentary committee has been investigating berlin 's role during the iraq war , the cia 's kidnapping of el masri as well as the cia 's secret flights and detention centers .

14 . " i expect the government to take concrete measures that such abductions never take place again , " lochbihler said .
" and to give clear instructions to intelligence services that nobody should use or participate in torture . " amnesty international has announced it will present a memorandum on germany 's eu presidency on jan .

in 2007 , there will be two cultural capitals - luxembourg and sibiu in romania .
sibiu 's old town is currently being renovated to bring it back to its former glory . sibiu , which is called hermannstadt in german , was founded by transylvanian saxons in the late twelfth century and rapidly became a significant trade center . it was the most important ethnic german city among seven cities , which gave transylvania its german-language name - siebenbürgen - and was home to the region 's assembly of germans .
the german legacy is still very visible in the city 's architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a peaceful day in transylvania when the austro-hungarian empire dissolved , sibiu became part of romania , although much of its population consisted of ethnic germans .
many emigrated to west germany under the romanian communist regime , and even more left for germany after its collapse in 1989 . klaus johannis , the mayor of sibiu , is one of around 2,000 ethnic germans who remained .
he has become a symbol of the city 's rebirth , which helped sibiu , a town of 160,000 people , to be chosen as europe 's next cultural capital . german minority plays significant role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the piata mica in sibiu " our history is precious and we should make the most of it , " johannis told deutsche welle .

" it 's hardly known in germany , for example , that there was a school system here even in the 14th century .
at a time when the royal courts in western europe were still full of illiterates , every tiny village here had a pastor and a teacher and the children could all read and write , " porr said . the german-language brukenthal grammar school in sibiu 's center maintains this tradition .
for the pupils there , it goes without saying that they are german and should speak german with each other .
they can not understand when asked why they are not speaking romanian , and yet they consider romania their homeland . this homeland is depicted by the renowned 72-year-old writer eginald schlattner .

sibiu 's old town is currently being renovated to bring it back to its former glory . sibiu , which is called hermannstadt in german , was founded by transylvanian saxons in the late twelfth century and rapidly became a significant trade center . it was the most important ethnic german city among seven cities , which gave transylvania its german-language name - siebenbürgen - and was home to the region 's assembly of germans .

virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .

virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .
they say an airlift of the material to russia would be irresponsible . " we can not understand at all why this transport of highly-enriched uranium should be carried out by airplane , " said tobias münchmeyer , a nuclear expert working for greenpeace germany .
" this is irresponsible because it is much more dangerous than by rail . " " without a doubt it will provoke strong protests , " he added . the material is waste from a research reactor that was built by the soviet union in east germany .
the reactor is currently being torn down , and its spent fuel rods are now to be reprocessed in russia . " absolutely safe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel transporting the waste by plane will make it vulnerable to attacks in spite of the protests , german nuclear authorities this week gave the green light for the airlift , saying the transport in a special russian cargo plane was absolutely safe . but activists reject transports of nuclear waste across borders . " we believe that every country with a nuclear industry should keep the nuclear waste it creates within its own borders , " said münchmeyer .
" that is why the german material must remain at the reactor site until a solution to the problem of final storage in germany has been found .

he also said the americans had acknowledged that the issues germany planned to focus on during its presidency of the european union and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- most industrialized countries had already been discussed with its transatlantic partners .
steinmeier was reluctant to comment on the american debate of the baker commission report which suggested this week the us adopt a new strategy toward iraq .
he said the us administration was critical of the recommendation that it contact iran and syria directly . " there is a lot of skepticism here on whether the time has come , " he said .

" i like minister steinmeier , but i think he made a mistake , " olmert , who is due in berlin tuesday for talks with chancellor angela merkel , told german rolling news channel n24 .
olmert said he had told steinmeier his opinion when the german minister was in israel last week , ahead of his brief stop in damascus monday . the israeli premier said syria was " actively " involved in terror acts and backed the bloody sectarian violence in iraq .
he accused steinmeier of failing to criticize the syrian government during his stay .
preparation for eu , g8 presidencies steinmeier met with us secretary of state condoleezza rice for five hours in washington on friday .
the visit was intended as preparation for germany assuming the rotating presidencies of the eu and the g8 in january .

virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .
they say an airlift of the material to russia would be irresponsible . " we can not understand at all why this transport of highly-enriched uranium should be carried out by airplane , " said tobias münchmeyer , a nuclear expert working for greenpeace germany .
" this is irresponsible because it is much more dangerous than by rail . " " without a doubt it will provoke strong protests , " he added . the material is waste from a research reactor that was built by the soviet union in east germany .
the reactor is currently being torn down , and its spent fuel rods are now to be reprocessed in russia . " absolutely safe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel transporting the waste by plane will make it vulnerable to attacks in spite of the protests , german nuclear authorities this week gave the green light for the airlift , saying the transport in a special russian cargo plane was absolutely safe . but activists reject transports of nuclear waste across borders . " we believe that every country with a nuclear industry should keep the nuclear waste it creates within its own borders , " said münchmeyer .
" that is why the german material must remain at the reactor site until a solution to the problem of final storage in germany has been found . " the recovery of the uranium is part of a joint russian-american program in cooperation with a united nations nuclear watchdog called global threat reduction initiative .
its aim is to find , secure and recover dangerous nuclear materials around the world to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists . german authorities said the precise day of the transport will not be disclosed , adding , however , that this was not because of a fear of violent protests . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .
they say an airlift of the material to russia would be irresponsible . " we can not understand at all why this transport of highly-enriched uranium should be carried out by airplane , " said tobias münchmeyer , a nuclear expert working for greenpeace germany .
" this is irresponsible because it is much more dangerous than by rail . " " without a doubt it will provoke strong protests , " he added . the material is waste from a research reactor that was built by the soviet union in east germany .
the reactor is currently being torn down , and its spent fuel rods are now to be reprocessed in russia . " absolutely safe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel transporting the waste by plane will make it vulnerable to attacks in spite of the protests , german nuclear authorities this week gave the green light for the airlift , saying the transport in a special russian cargo plane was absolutely safe . but activists reject transports of nuclear waste across borders . " we believe that every country with a nuclear industry should keep the nuclear waste it creates within its own borders , " said münchmeyer .
" that is why the german material must remain at the reactor site until a solution to the problem of final storage in germany has been found . " the recovery of the uranium is part of a joint russian-american program in cooperation with a united nations nuclear watchdog called global threat reduction initiative .
its aim is to find , secure and recover dangerous nuclear materials around the world to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists . german authorities said the precise day of the transport will not be disclosed , adding , however , that this was not because of a fear of violent protests . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

" we must recognize the fact that there is no end to human rights violations in sight , " lochbihler said .
" the us congress recently passed a bill that again introduces military courts which should clearly operate below international legal standards .
the bill also allows interrogation methods that should be clearly labeled as torture . " germany will assume the presidency over the european union on jan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lochbihler expects more from germany and the eu for amnesty international , this is a problem - especially in view of the human rights violations that have been taking place under the umbrella of the fight against terror . no sign of closure a thorn in the eye of many human rights organizations is the us-run prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
controversial since its establishment , the camp has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
eu lawmakers and civil rights campaigners have for a long time called on us officials to close the facility . " in guantanamo , new buildings are being built , for example for these military courts .
there is no sign that it 's going to get closed , " lochbihler said . the role of germany 's government officials and intelligence services in the fight against terror must , according to amnesty international , be clarified .
especially , in those cases , in which there are indications that human rights violations may have been planned on german soil - in the us army european headquarters in stuttgart-vaihingen , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us army patch barracks in stuttgart-vaihingen " it is also not clear what the government knew about the abduction of mr. el masri , " lochbihler said . who knew what ? in 2003 , the cia abducted german national khaled el masri in macedonia and flew him to afghanistan where he was detained for five months as a terror suspect and allegedly mistreated .
us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . a german parliamentary committee has been investigating berlin 's role during the iraq war , the cia 's kidnapping of el masri as well as the cia 's secret flights and detention centers .

he also said the americans had acknowledged that the issues germany planned to focus on during its presidency of the european union and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- most industrialized countries had already been discussed with its transatlantic partners .
steinmeier was reluctant to comment on the american debate of the baker commission report which suggested this week the us adopt a new strategy toward iraq .
he said the us administration was critical of the recommendation that it contact iran and syria directly . " there is a lot of skepticism here on whether the time has come , " he said .
on the other hand , however , a conference with iraq 's neighbors was being considered , he added .

" i like minister steinmeier , but i think he made a mistake , " olmert , who is due in berlin tuesday for talks with chancellor angela merkel , told german rolling news channel n24 .
olmert said he had told steinmeier his opinion when the german minister was in israel last week , ahead of his brief stop in damascus monday . the israeli premier said syria was " actively " involved in terror acts and backed the bloody sectarian violence in iraq .
he accused steinmeier of failing to criticize the syrian government during his stay .
preparation for eu , g8 presidencies steinmeier met with us secretary of state condoleezza rice for five hours in washington on friday .
the visit was intended as preparation for germany assuming the rotating presidencies of the eu and the g8 in january .

" we must recognize the fact that there is no end to human rights violations in sight , " lochbihler said .
" the us congress recently passed a bill that again introduces military courts which should clearly operate below international legal standards .
the bill also allows interrogation methods that should be clearly labeled as torture . " germany will assume the presidency over the european union on jan .
1 .
it has so far made no indications that it plans to focus on human rights during the six months it will be charged with conducting the eu 's business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lochbihler expects more from germany and the eu for amnesty international , this is a problem - especially in view of the human rights violations that have been taking place under the umbrella of the fight against terror . no sign of closure a thorn in the eye of many human rights organizations is the us-run prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
controversial since its establishment , the camp has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
eu lawmakers and civil rights campaigners have for a long time called on us officials to close the facility . " in guantanamo , new buildings are being built , for example for these military courts .
there is no sign that it 's going to get closed , " lochbihler said . the role of germany 's government officials and intelligence services in the fight against terror must , according to amnesty international , be clarified .
especially , in those cases , in which there are indications that human rights violations may have been planned on german soil - in the us army european headquarters in stuttgart-vaihingen , for example .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us army patch barracks in stuttgart-vaihingen " it is also not clear what the government knew about the abduction of mr. el masri , " lochbihler said . who knew what ? in 2003 , the cia abducted german national khaled el masri in macedonia and flew him to afghanistan where he was detained for five months as a terror suspect and allegedly mistreated .
us officials acknowledged to the german government in 2004 that the man had been mistaken for somebody else and had been wrongly detained . a german parliamentary committee has been investigating berlin 's role during the iraq war , the cia 's kidnapping of el masri as well as the cia 's secret flights and detention centers .

" and to give clear instructions to intelligence services that nobody should use or participate in torture . " amnesty international has announced it will present a memorandum on germany 's eu presidency on jan .

sibiu 's old town is currently being renovated to bring it back to its former glory . sibiu , which is called hermannstadt in german , was founded by transylvanian saxons in the late twelfth century and rapidly became a significant trade center . it was the most important ethnic german city among seven cities , which gave transylvania its german-language name - siebenbürgen - and was home to the region 's assembly of germans .
the german legacy is still very visible in the city 's architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a peaceful day in transylvania when the austro-hungarian empire dissolved , sibiu became part of romania , although much of its population consisted of ethnic germans .
many emigrated to west germany under the romanian communist regime , and even more left for germany after its collapse in 1989 . klaus johannis , the mayor of sibiu , is one of around 2,000 ethnic germans who remained .
he has become a symbol of the city 's rebirth , which helped sibiu , a town of 160,000 people , to be chosen as europe 's next cultural capital . german minority plays significant role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the piata mica in sibiu " our history is precious and we should make the most of it , " johannis told deutsche welle .
" the german minority is clearly a part of this .

" it 's hardly known in germany , for example , that there was a school system here even in the 14th century .
at a time when the royal courts in western europe were still full of illiterates , every tiny village here had a pastor and a teacher and the children could all read and write , " porr said . the german-language brukenthal grammar school in sibiu 's center maintains this tradition .
for the pupils there , it goes without saying that they are german and should speak german with each other .
they can not understand when asked why they are not speaking romanian , and yet they consider romania their homeland . this homeland is depicted by the renowned 72-year-old writer eginald schlattner .
his work focuses on the cultural mix in sibiu and how different ethnic groups have lived side-by-side for centuries . in " the beheaded rooster " -lrb- " der geköpfte hahn " -rrb- , he describes his experiences of growing up during the nazi period .
he writes that his father would answer greetings in four languages but never said " heil hitler " or " at your service , madame . "

in 2007 , there will be two cultural capitals - luxembourg and sibiu in romania .
sibiu 's old town is currently being renovated to bring it back to its former glory . sibiu , which is called hermannstadt in german , was founded by transylvanian saxons in the late twelfth century and rapidly became a significant trade center . it was the most important ethnic german city among seven cities , which gave transylvania its german-language name - siebenbürgen - and was home to the region 's assembly of germans .
the german legacy is still very visible in the city 's architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a peaceful day in transylvania when the austro-hungarian empire dissolved , sibiu became part of romania , although much of its population consisted of ethnic germans .
many emigrated to west germany under the romanian communist regime , and even more left for germany after its collapse in 1989 . klaus johannis , the mayor of sibiu , is one of around 2,000 ethnic germans who remained .
he has become a symbol of the city 's rebirth , which helped sibiu , a town of 160,000 people , to be chosen as europe 's next cultural capital . german minority plays significant role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the piata mica in sibiu " our history is precious and we should make the most of it , " johannis told deutsche welle .
" the german minority is clearly a part of this .
in the framework of being a cultural capital , we want to highlight that as well . " " we always were ' good europeans , ' even in the darkest middle ages , " added paul jürgen porr from the democratic forum of germans in romania .
" it 's hardly known in germany , for example , that there was a school system here even in the 14th century .
at a time when the royal courts in western europe were still full of illiterates , every tiny village here had a pastor and a teacher and the children could all read and write , " porr said . the german-language brukenthal grammar school in sibiu 's center maintains this tradition .
for the pupils there , it goes without saying that they are german and should speak german with each other .
they can not understand when asked why they are not speaking romanian , and yet they consider romania their homeland . this homeland is depicted by the renowned 72-year-old writer eginald schlattner .
his work focuses on the cultural mix in sibiu and how different ethnic groups have lived side-by-side for centuries . in " the beheaded rooster " -lrb- " der geköpfte hahn " -rrb- , he describes his experiences of growing up during the nazi period .
he writes that his father would answer greetings in four languages but never said " heil hitler " or " at your service , madame . "
the novel is currently being filmed . an enviable cultural mix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dracula 's castle - sibiu hopes to give another meaning to transylvania sibiu not only has a german minority , however , but also boasts hungarians , romas , jews and armenians . " we are a good example that all these ethnic groups can get along in a city like ours , " said the mayor , who in contrast to some central european politicians prefers to promote respect rather than assimilation . sibiu 's inhabitants hope that transylvania and romania as a whole will be given a boost thanks to its role as europe 's cultural capital of 2007 . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania , bulgaria get go-ahead for eu membership the european commission gave the green light tuesday for bulgaria and romania to join the eu on jan .

" i like minister steinmeier , but i think he made a mistake , " olmert , who is due in berlin tuesday for talks with chancellor angela merkel , told german rolling news channel n24 .
olmert said he had told steinmeier his opinion when the german minister was in israel last week , ahead of his brief stop in damascus monday . the israeli premier said syria was " actively " involved in terror acts and backed the bloody sectarian violence in iraq .
he accused steinmeier of failing to criticize the syrian government during his stay .
preparation for eu , g8 presidencies steinmeier met with us secretary of state condoleezza rice for five hours in washington on friday .
the visit was intended as preparation for germany assuming the rotating presidencies of the eu and the g8 in january .

virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .
they say an airlift of the material to russia would be irresponsible . " we can not understand at all why this transport of highly-enriched uranium should be carried out by airplane , " said tobias münchmeyer , a nuclear expert working for greenpeace germany .
" this is irresponsible because it is much more dangerous than by rail . " " without a doubt it will provoke strong protests , " he added . the material is waste from a research reactor that was built by the soviet union in east germany .
the reactor is currently being torn down , and its spent fuel rods are now to be reprocessed in russia . " absolutely safe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel transporting the waste by plane will make it vulnerable to attacks in spite of the protests , german nuclear authorities this week gave the green light for the airlift , saying the transport in a special russian cargo plane was absolutely safe . but activists reject transports of nuclear waste across borders . " we believe that every country with a nuclear industry should keep the nuclear waste it creates within its own borders , " said münchmeyer .
" that is why the german material must remain at the reactor site until a solution to the problem of final storage in germany has been found . " the recovery of the uranium is part of a joint russian-american program in cooperation with a united nations nuclear watchdog called global threat reduction initiative .
its aim is to find , secure and recover dangerous nuclear materials around the world to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists . german authorities said the precise day of the transport will not be disclosed , adding , however , that this was not because of a fear of violent protests . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .
they say an airlift of the material to russia would be irresponsible . " we can not understand at all why this transport of highly-enriched uranium should be carried out by airplane , " said tobias münchmeyer , a nuclear expert working for greenpeace germany .
" this is irresponsible because it is much more dangerous than by rail . " " without a doubt it will provoke strong protests , " he added . the material is waste from a research reactor that was built by the soviet union in east germany .
the reactor is currently being torn down , and its spent fuel rods are now to be reprocessed in russia . " absolutely safe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel transporting the waste by plane will make it vulnerable to attacks in spite of the protests , german nuclear authorities this week gave the green light for the airlift , saying the transport in a special russian cargo plane was absolutely safe . but activists reject transports of nuclear waste across borders . " we believe that every country with a nuclear industry should keep the nuclear waste it creates within its own borders , " said münchmeyer .
" that is why the german material must remain at the reactor site until a solution to the problem of final storage in germany has been found . " the recovery of the uranium is part of a joint russian-american program in cooperation with a united nations nuclear watchdog called global threat reduction initiative .
its aim is to find , secure and recover dangerous nuclear materials around the world to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists . german authorities said the precise day of the transport will not be disclosed , adding , however , that this was not because of a fear of violent protests . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

" we must recognize the fact that there is no end to human rights violations in sight , " lochbihler said .
" the us congress recently passed a bill that again introduces military courts which should clearly operate below international legal standards .
the bill also allows interrogation methods that should be clearly labeled as torture . " germany will assume the presidency over the european union on jan .
1 .
it has so far made no indications that it plans to focus on human rights during the six months it will be charged with conducting the eu 's business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lochbihler expects more from germany and the eu for amnesty international , this is a problem - especially in view of the human rights violations that have been taking place under the umbrella of the fight against terror . no sign of closure a thorn in the eye of many human rights organizations is the us-run prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
controversial since its establishment , the camp has some 500 inmates , most of whom have never been charged .
eu lawmakers and civil rights campaigners have for a long time called on us officials to close the facility . " in guantanamo , new buildings are being built , for example for these military courts .

steinmeier was reluctant to comment on the american debate of the baker commission report which suggested this week the us adopt a new strategy toward iraq .
he said the us administration was critical of the recommendation that it contact iran and syria directly . " there is a lot of skepticism here on whether the time has come , " he said .

" i like minister steinmeier , but i think he made a mistake , " olmert , who is due in berlin tuesday for talks with chancellor angela merkel , told german rolling news channel n24 .
olmert said he had told steinmeier his opinion when the german minister was in israel last week , ahead of his brief stop in damascus monday . the israeli premier said syria was " actively " involved in terror acts and backed the bloody sectarian violence in iraq .
he accused steinmeier of failing to criticize the syrian government during his stay .

the visit was intended as preparation for germany assuming the rotating presidencies of the eu and the g8 in january .

in 2007 , there will be two cultural capitals - luxembourg and sibiu in romania .
sibiu 's old town is currently being renovated to bring it back to its former glory . sibiu , which is called hermannstadt in german , was founded by transylvanian saxons in the late twelfth century and rapidly became a significant trade center . it was the most important ethnic german city among seven cities , which gave transylvania its german-language name - siebenbürgen - and was home to the region 's assembly of germans .

virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .
they say an airlift of the material to russia would be irresponsible . " we can not understand at all why this transport of highly-enriched uranium should be carried out by airplane , " said tobias münchmeyer , a nuclear expert working for greenpeace germany .
" this is irresponsible because it is much more dangerous than by rail . " " without a doubt it will provoke strong protests , " he added . the material is waste from a research reactor that was built by the soviet union in east germany .
the reactor is currently being torn down , and its spent fuel rods are now to be reprocessed in russia .

" we believe that every country with a nuclear industry should keep the nuclear waste it creates within its own borders , " said münchmeyer .
" that is why the german material must remain at the reactor site until a solution to the problem of final storage in germany has been found . " the recovery of the uranium is part of a joint russian-american program in cooperation with a united nations nuclear watchdog called global threat reduction initiative .
its aim is to find , secure and recover dangerous nuclear materials around the world to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists . german authorities said the precise day of the transport will not be disclosed , adding , however , that this was not because of a fear of violent protests . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

in 2007 , there will be two cultural capitals - luxembourg and sibiu in romania .
sibiu 's old town is currently being renovated to bring it back to its former glory . sibiu , which is called hermannstadt in german , was founded by transylvanian saxons in the late twelfth century and rapidly became a significant trade center . it was the most important ethnic german city among seven cities , which gave transylvania its german-language name - siebenbürgen - and was home to the region 's assembly of germans .
the german legacy is still very visible in the city 's architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a peaceful day in transylvania when the austro-hungarian empire dissolved , sibiu became part of romania , although much of its population consisted of ethnic germans .
many emigrated to west germany under the romanian communist regime , and even more left for germany after its collapse in 1989 . klaus johannis , the mayor of sibiu , is one of around 2,000 ethnic germans who remained .
he has become a symbol of the city 's rebirth , which helped sibiu , a town of 160,000 people , to be chosen as europe 's next cultural capital . german minority plays significant role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the piata mica in sibiu " our history is precious and we should make the most of it , " johannis told deutsche welle .
" the german minority is clearly a part of this .

" it 's hardly known in germany , for example , that there was a school system here even in the 14th century .
at a time when the royal courts in western europe were still full of illiterates , every tiny village here had a pastor and a teacher and the children could all read and write , " porr said . the german-language brukenthal grammar school in sibiu 's center maintains this tradition .
for the pupils there , it goes without saying that they are german and should speak german with each other .
they can not understand when asked why they are not speaking romanian , and yet they consider romania their homeland . this homeland is depicted by the renowned 72-year-old writer eginald schlattner .
his work focuses on the cultural mix in sibiu and how different ethnic groups have lived side-by-side for centuries . in " the beheaded rooster " -lrb- " der geköpfte hahn " -rrb- , he describes his experiences of growing up during the nazi period .
he writes that his father would answer greetings in four languages but never said " heil hitler " or " at your service , madame . "

in 2007 , there will be two cultural capitals - luxembourg and sibiu in romania .
sibiu 's old town is currently being renovated to bring it back to its former glory . sibiu , which is called hermannstadt in german , was founded by transylvanian saxons in the late twelfth century and rapidly became a significant trade center . it was the most important ethnic german city among seven cities , which gave transylvania its german-language name - siebenbürgen - and was home to the region 's assembly of germans .
the german legacy is still very visible in the city 's architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a peaceful day in transylvania when the austro-hungarian empire dissolved , sibiu became part of romania , although much of its population consisted of ethnic germans .
many emigrated to west germany under the romanian communist regime , and even more left for germany after its collapse in 1989 . klaus johannis , the mayor of sibiu , is one of around 2,000 ethnic germans who remained .
he has become a symbol of the city 's rebirth , which helped sibiu , a town of 160,000 people , to be chosen as europe 's next cultural capital . german minority plays significant role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of the piata mica in sibiu " our history is precious and we should make the most of it , " johannis told deutsche welle .

" it 's hardly known in germany , for example , that there was a school system here even in the 14th century .
at a time when the royal courts in western europe were still full of illiterates , every tiny village here had a pastor and a teacher and the children could all read and write , " porr said . the german-language brukenthal grammar school in sibiu 's center maintains this tradition .
for the pupils there , it goes without saying that they are german and should speak german with each other .
they can not understand when asked why they are not speaking romanian , and yet they consider romania their homeland . this homeland is depicted by the renowned 72-year-old writer eginald schlattner .
his work focuses on the cultural mix in sibiu and how different ethnic groups have lived side-by-side for centuries . in " the beheaded rooster " -lrb- " der geköpfte hahn " -rrb- , he describes his experiences of growing up during the nazi period .

sibiu 's old town is currently being renovated to bring it back to its former glory . sibiu , which is called hermannstadt in german , was founded by transylvanian saxons in the late twelfth century and rapidly became a significant trade center . it was the most important ethnic german city among seven cities , which gave transylvania its german-language name - siebenbürgen - and was home to the region 's assembly of germans .

virtually every year , thousands of activists chain themselves to railroad tracks and clash with police to protest against nuclear transports to and from france , where german nuclear waste is reprocessed . activists have now been given a fresh reason for being up in arms , as germany and russia have agreed to airlift 300 kilograms of enriched uranium out of germany - much of it suitable for building atomic bombs . according to authorities , some 200 of the 300 kilogram shipment consists of highly-enriched uranium , which theoretically could be used to fuel around 10 nuclear weapons . irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green campaigners believe nuclear waste should not cross borders the decision caused a storm of protest from german anti-nuclear campaigners , who have long been protesting against shipping nuclear fuels across europe .
they say an airlift of the material to russia would be irresponsible . " we can not understand at all why this transport of highly-enriched uranium should be carried out by airplane , " said tobias münchmeyer , a nuclear expert working for greenpeace germany .
" this is irresponsible because it is much more dangerous than by rail . " " without a doubt it will provoke strong protests , " he added . the material is waste from a research reactor that was built by the soviet union in east germany .
the reactor is currently being torn down , and its spent fuel rods are now to be reprocessed in russia . " absolutely safe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel transporting the waste by plane will make it vulnerable to attacks in spite of the protests , german nuclear authorities this week gave the green light for the airlift , saying the transport in a special russian cargo plane was absolutely safe . but activists reject transports of nuclear waste across borders . " we believe that every country with a nuclear industry should keep the nuclear waste it creates within its own borders , " said münchmeyer .
" that is why the german material must remain at the reactor site until a solution to the problem of final storage in germany has been found . " the recovery of the uranium is part of a joint russian-american program in cooperation with a united nations nuclear watchdog called global threat reduction initiative .
its aim is to find , secure and recover dangerous nuclear materials around the world to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists . german authorities said the precise day of the transport will not be disclosed , adding , however , that this was not because of a fear of violent protests . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .

the number of parents going to prison for non-payment of child maintenance also rose to 22 , from six in 2005 .
the figures come as the agency , which has been dogged by problems and is owed £ 3.5bn , is to be scrapped .
campaigners fear that more than £ 1bn owed to parents will be written off when the agency is replaced .
the details of the agency 's replacement , which will have more enforcement powers , are set to be announced next week .
we are really worried the government is going to write off £ 1bn of debt james price , family lawyers group the csa , which was set up 13 years ago , said its use of debt collectors had enabled it to recover about £ 320,000 which it would not otherwise have recovered .
it has transferred about 10,500 cases to the private sector .
bbc political correspondent gary o 'donoghue said these cases were worth an estimated £ 45m of the total debt .
in july , the csa had a backlog of 300,000 cases and was the subject of many complaints from parents .
fears the child support bill , unveiled in the queen 's speech , aims to replace it with a smaller body and a simpler way of collecting child maintenance .
work and pensions secretary john hutton has said the government will seek more powers to deal with parents who repeatedly fail to pay maintenance - such as suspending passports and imposing curfews .
but campaigners are worried that tens of thousands of parents will see money owed to them in child support written off .
james price , of the family lawyers group , said : " we are really worried the government is going to write off £ 1bn of debt and that will affect tens of thousands of families and encourage non-payment in the future .

the number of parents going to prison for non-payment of child maintenance also rose to 22 , from six in 2005 .
the figures come as the agency , which has been dogged by problems and is owed £ 3.5bn , is to be scrapped .
campaigners fear that more than £ 1bn owed to parents will be written off when the agency is replaced .
the details of the agency 's replacement , which will have more enforcement powers , are set to be announced next week .
we are really worried the government is going to write off £ 1bn of debt james price , family lawyers group the csa , which was set up 13 years ago , said its use of debt collectors had enabled it to recover about £ 320,000 which it would not otherwise have recovered .
it has transferred about 10,500 cases to the private sector .
bbc political correspondent gary o 'donoghue said these cases were worth an estimated £ 45m of the total debt .
in july , the csa had a backlog of 300,000 cases and was the subject of many complaints from parents .
fears the child support bill , unveiled in the queen 's speech , aims to replace it with a smaller body and a simpler way of collecting child maintenance .
work and pensions secretary john hutton has said the government will seek more powers to deal with parents who repeatedly fail to pay maintenance - such as suspending passports and imposing curfews .
but campaigners are worried that tens of thousands of parents will see money owed to them in child support written off .
james price , of the family lawyers group , said : " we are really worried the government is going to write off £ 1bn of debt and that will affect tens of thousands of families and encourage non-payment in the future .
" there have been so many mistakes in the past which the government has n't learned from . "
' unfair ' jacqueline harthill , who says she is owed £ 10,000 in child support payments for her daughter , said she was " outraged " at the prospect of having the money written off .
" i 've had to re-mortgage three times just to try to stay afloat and they are telling me they might write off this £ 10,000 which might make a difference , " she said .
" this is just so unfair .
it 's not their money , it 's not even my money .
it 's money that is actually owed to my daughter and i 'm just outraged . "
james pirrie , of the credit services association , the uk 's national association for debt recovery agencies , said : " there have been major problems sorting the type of debt , how much and whether or not these amounts are actually true .
" of course there 's tracing issues as well where people have left their addresses and the information that we have is not correct information in the first instance . "

" of course there 's tracing issues as well where people have left their addresses and the information that we have is not correct information in the first instance . "

but the final of the next big thing - the bbc 's global search for the best young musical talent - was different in a couple of ways .
firstly , all the acts were aged under 18 .
secondly , they were all really rather good .
in this case , selecting the eventual winner would be legendary producer william orbit , rough trade founder jeff travis , african star angelique kidjo and dirty pretty things drummer gary powell , with former genesis frontman peter gabriel also giving his input .
and so to the acts .
brazilian six-piece combo sweet cherry fury began the night with their jaunty , raucous take on boredom in exams , cold blonde body .
having flown 20 hours from sao paulo - and lost their luggage en route - they were determined not to let a minor technical hitch that had delayed the start of the gig put them off .
lyrical flow impressively , performing live at the bbc 's famous maida vale studios in front of industry icons seemed to inspire them rather than make them nervous - something , on the most part , in common with all the performers on the night .
they threw themselves into their songs with both intensity and passion .
as vardy , the lead singer of british three-piece rock group skagz put it , " we 're having the time our lives . "
pictures from the final there was an intense performance from malawian rap act nic , a duo who volleyed words back and forth like sampras and ivanisevic in their prime , deciding not to bother with those fancy passing shots and just belting the ball at each other .
their angry - if interestingly anti-materialistic - rap stems from their frustration at attempting to break into the music industry in africa .
judge gary powell was particularly impressed by what he described as their " lyrical flow " , saying they could be understood better " than acts in the charts earning millions " .
nic would eventually finish second , a place shared with british duo stefan and mya - whose much more light-hearted song , my dunks , is about a fashion victim and his girlfriend , who feels she is always second-best to her man 's trainers .
their bickering couple style drew high praise from the judges .
" i 'd say you 're like lily allen , but you 're much better than that , " said powell .
but everyone brought something different to the final , despite - or perhaps because of - their widely diverse backgrounds , sounds , and themes .
refugee malikinke delivered a multi-language plea to african men to think before they sleep around ; us multi-member group mlk performed an eight-word , two-minute celebration of martin luther king ; while the skagz thrashed out their up-tempo rock song about singer vardy " getting attacked in the mining village of whitwell " .
winner as soon as she stepped behind the microphone , however , the star quality of the act who go on to win shone through .
armenian performer silva not only sang , she also really performed , coupling her smooth vocal with some well-honed dance moves .
the 17-year-old 's tango-based song i like - written by her sister and produced by her brother - would not have sounded out of place on any hit-centred radio station .
there was genuine camaraderie between the acts but , with a little polish , the same could have been said for most of the other acts too .
none were noticeably weak - a benefit , perhaps , of having a panel of music industry experts give their input into choosing the final seven .
the four judges admitted they had expected the standard to be " much lower " , and were visibly impressed .
as they deliberated and the groups awaited the result , the genuine camaraderie that had grown between the acts - they had stayed together in the same hotel since arriving in london earlier in the week , and cheered each others ' performances - was clear to see .
they all stood huddled together , nervously chatting to each other , offering congratulatory handshakes and hugs whenever one of them was mentioned by name by the judges .
when the result was announced , the cheers and applause were such that any one of them could have been cheering their own win as much as silva 's .
silva herself was utterly overwhelmed by the experience , and accepted the trophy with tears in her eyes .
asked if she was happy to have won , she could manage only one word : " yes . "

but the final of the next big thing - the bbc 's global search for the best young musical talent - was different in a couple of ways .
firstly , all the acts were aged under 18 .
secondly , they were all really rather good .
in this case , selecting the eventual winner would be legendary producer william orbit , rough trade founder jeff travis , african star angelique kidjo and dirty pretty things drummer gary powell , with former genesis frontman peter gabriel also giving his input .
and so to the acts .
brazilian six-piece combo sweet cherry fury began the night with their jaunty , raucous take on boredom in exams , cold blonde body .
having flown 20 hours from sao paulo - and lost their luggage en route - they were determined not to let a minor technical hitch that had delayed the start of the gig put them off .
lyrical flow impressively , performing live at the bbc 's famous maida vale studios in front of industry icons seemed to inspire them rather than make them nervous - something , on the most part , in common with all the performers on the night .
they threw themselves into their songs with both intensity and passion .
as vardy , the lead singer of british three-piece rock group skagz put it , " we 're having the time our lives . "
pictures from the final there was an intense performance from malawian rap act nic , a duo who volleyed words back and forth like sampras and ivanisevic in their prime , deciding not to bother with those fancy passing shots and just belting the ball at each other .
their angry - if interestingly anti-materialistic - rap stems from their frustration at attempting to break into the music industry in africa .
judge gary powell was particularly impressed by what he described as their " lyrical flow " , saying they could be understood better " than acts in the charts earning millions " .
nic would eventually finish second , a place shared with british duo stefan and mya - whose much more light-hearted song , my dunks , is about a fashion victim and his girlfriend , who feels she is always second-best to her man 's trainers .
their bickering couple style drew high praise from the judges .
" i 'd say you 're like lily allen , but you 're much better than that , " said powell .
but everyone brought something different to the final , despite - or perhaps because of - their widely diverse backgrounds , sounds , and themes .
refugee malikinke delivered a multi-language plea to african men to think before they sleep around ; us multi-member group mlk performed an eight-word , two-minute celebration of martin luther king ; while the skagz thrashed out their up-tempo rock song about singer vardy " getting attacked in the mining village of whitwell " .
winner as soon as she stepped behind the microphone , however , the star quality of the act who go on to win shone through .
armenian performer silva not only sang , she also really performed , coupling her smooth vocal with some well-honed dance moves .
the 17-year-old 's tango-based song i like - written by her sister and produced by her brother - would not have sounded out of place on any hit-centred radio station .
there was genuine camaraderie between the acts but , with a little polish , the same could have been said for most of the other acts too .
none were noticeably weak - a benefit , perhaps , of having a panel of music industry experts give their input into choosing the final seven .
the four judges admitted they had expected the standard to be " much lower " , and were visibly impressed .
as they deliberated and the groups awaited the result , the genuine camaraderie that had grown between the acts - they had stayed together in the same hotel since arriving in london earlier in the week , and cheered each others ' performances - was clear to see .
they all stood huddled together , nervously chatting to each other , offering congratulatory handshakes and hugs whenever one of them was mentioned by name by the judges .
when the result was announced , the cheers and applause were such that any one of them could have been cheering their own win as much as silva 's .
silva herself was utterly overwhelmed by the experience , and accepted the trophy with tears in her eyes .
asked if she was happy to have won , she could manage only one word : " yes . "
