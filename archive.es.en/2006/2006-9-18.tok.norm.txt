ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .
i do n't expect that his vacation will be moved to bavaria . have you talked to your brother si n ce his retur n to rome ? we have talked on the phone . has he talked to you about the co n troversy surrou n di n g his speech at the u n iversity of rege n sburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg ratzinger he mentioned it briefly .
of course he regrets that muslims have reacted like that and have completely misunderstood him .
it 's not his opinion .
he would never hold such a view .
it 's the quote of a man , who lived 500 years ago .
naturally , it 's a grotesque misunderstanding that it was taken out of context and presented as if it were his opinion .
but he hopes that it will be sorted out and understood when he explains the situation correctly - and that it wo n't have consequences for mutual relations . mathis winkler interviewed georg ratzinger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : latest clash of cultures should be laid to rest the pope 's apology sunday was accepted by some muslim leaders but outraged other radical groups even more .

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .
i do n't expect that his vacation will be moved to bavaria . have you talked to your brother si n ce his retur n to rome ? we have talked on the phone . has he talked to you about the co n troversy surrou n di n g his speech at the u n iversity of rege n sburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg ratzinger he mentioned it briefly .
of course he regrets that muslims have reacted like that and have completely misunderstood him .
it 's not his opinion .
he would never hold such a view .
it 's the quote of a man , who lived 500 years ago .
naturally , it 's a grotesque misunderstanding that it was taken out of context and presented as if it were his opinion .
but he hopes that it will be sorted out and understood when he explains the situation correctly - and that it wo n't have consequences for mutual relations . mathis winkler interviewed georg ratzinger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : latest clash of cultures should be laid to rest the pope 's apology sunday was accepted by some muslim leaders but outraged other radical groups even more .

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .
perhaps a sign to others to imitate the pope : to exchange intolerance and arrogance for humanity , modesty and reason ?
and to do everything they can to smooth the waves of indignation ? peter philipp is an expert on middle east affairs and deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . peter philipp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope makes personal apology to muslims pope benedict xvi said he was " deeply sorry " sunday for outrage triggered across the muslim world by remarks he made about islam and stressed they had not reflected his personal opinion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2006 press review : alarm bells ring over support for far right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national democratic party is now represented in four state legislatures after the far-right national democratic party took 7.3 percent of the vote in mecklenburg-western pomerania , the german press started ringing alarm bells . on sunday , the far-right nationalist party gained 7.3 percent of the vote in the economically depressed northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the returns represented a significant increase compared to the state 's previous election , in which they received less than one percent of the votes . the gains also mean that the npd , which caters to the frustrations and anti-foreigner sentiments of the unemployed in germany 's poorest state , now is represented in four german state legislatures .
for the german press , the far-right victory is cause for sounding the alarm bells . easterners unimpressed by democracy " in the interests of democracy , one should not underestimate the success of the npd . what is nightmarish is the finding that half of the voters in the eastern part of germany are unimpressed by democratic principles and freedoms that are valued in the west , " proclaimed the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , based in the industrial ruhr valley . npd party is reminiscent of the nazis the liberal süddeutsche zeitung likened the npd to adolf hitler 's national socialists and warned that the neo-nazi party is a greater threat than other far right parties in europe , because " germany is in the situation of a dry alcoholic , who is experiencing a relapse , which makes it problematic to wait until they simply self-destruct out of their own stupidity . " the munich-based daily added that the npd party is young , well-organized and maintains the façade of respectability by championing small causes , such as the protest against rising utility costs .
npd addresses everyday concerns of voters another national newspaper , the frankfurter rundschau proclaimed , " faced with this election result , we must be particularly concerned about the fact that over the last few years the npd has managed to penetrate society , in particular in eastern germany .
-lrb- they -rrb- organize children 's fetes , youth concerts , and distribute cds outside schools . "
according to berlin 's tagesspiegel , " the npd has achieved its goal , side by side with the left party and the social democrats , to establish themselves as a party for the small everyday man . "
it added that npd voters can no longer be dismissed as misguided , but essentially decent people after the " atmosphere of violence and intimidation " surrounding the party 's election campaign in berlin .
but the newspaper made no excuses for such voters .
" they know what they are doing .

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .
perhaps a sign to others to imitate the pope : to exchange intolerance and arrogance for humanity , modesty and reason ?
and to do everything they can to smooth the waves of indignation ? peter philipp is an expert on middle east affairs and deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . peter philipp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope makes personal apology to muslims pope benedict xvi said he was " deeply sorry " sunday for outrage triggered across the muslim world by remarks he made about islam and stressed they had not reflected his personal opinion .

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2006 far-right enter fourth german state legislature großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right npd - shown here at a march in may - made significant gains in sunday 's election .
voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .
neo-nazis enter fourth state parliament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo pastörs -lrb- r . -rrb- , candidate for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania this now makes the economically depressed state the fourth regional legislature where an extreme right party is represented : ; the npd also sits in saxony 's parliament while the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- is represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg and bremen .
mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .
once asked about the disastrous state of berlin 's finances , wowi , as he is affectionately called by his supporters , memorably declared : ' berlin may be poor .
but it 's sexy . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .

voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .

mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the pope in bavaria opinion : a calculated risk pope benedict xvi : " we have a positive idea to offer " the pope as pop star in bavaria pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image current affairs -pipe- 18.09.2006 opinion : latest clash of cultures should be laid to rest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's apology sunday was accepted by some muslim leaders but outraged other radical groups even more .
his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .
perhaps a sign to others to imitate the pope : to exchange intolerance and arrogance for humanity , modesty and reason ?
and to do everything they can to smooth the waves of indignation ? peter philipp is an expert on middle east affairs and deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . peter philipp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope makes personal apology to muslims pope benedict xvi said he was " deeply sorry " sunday for outrage triggered across the muslim world by remarks he made about islam and stressed they had not reflected his personal opinion .

polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .

mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .

"
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .

the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2006 pope 's brother : " he hopes that it will be sorted out " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratzinger accompanied his brother for four days , but the brothers had little private time in his first interview since benedict xvi 's visit to bavaria , the pope 's brother talks about the trip , papal vacation plans and the pontiff 's reaction to muslim protests against his speech in regensburg . on sunday , a vatican flag with the papal coat of arms still flew outside georg ratzinger 's home in the center of the bavarian town of regensburg , where benedict xvi had visited his 82-year-old brother last wednesday .
ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .
i do n't expect that his vacation will be moved to bavaria . have you talked to your brother si n ce his retur n to rome ? we have talked on the phone . has he talked to you about the co n troversy surrou n di n g his speech at the u n iversity of rege n sburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg ratzinger he mentioned it briefly .
of course he regrets that muslims have reacted like that and have completely misunderstood him .
it 's not his opinion .
he would never hold such a view .
it 's the quote of a man , who lived 500 years ago .
naturally , it 's a grotesque misunderstanding that it was taken out of context and presented as if it were his opinion .
but he hopes that it will be sorted out and understood when he explains the situation correctly - and that it wo n't have consequences for mutual relations . mathis winkler interviewed georg ratzinger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : latest clash of cultures should be laid to rest the pope 's apology sunday was accepted by some muslim leaders but outraged other radical groups even more .

the eu has sent border police there to fight smuggling but wo n't recognize independence . according to election reports in tiraspol , the declared capital of trans-dniester , 97.1 percent of referendum participants voted " yes " on sunday to the suggestive referendum question posed by self-declared president igor smirnov : " do you support a path of independence for the moldovan trans-dniester republic and its future accession to the russian federation ? " some 78 percent of the approximately 550,000 residents in the russian-speaking region located between the western border of ukraine and the dniester river turned out for the referendum . little recognition of independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-dniester does not share a border with russia trans-dniester is still officially a part of europe-oriented , romanian-speaking moldova .
prior to the referendum , the european union , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and moldova declared trans-dniester 's proposed succession illegal and refused to recognize its independence . " the referendum negates all the efforts of the moldovan leadership to resolve the conflict , " said moldovan president vladimir voronin . trans-dniester 's leaders , on the other hand , said they were optimistic that the referendum results would strengthen their position in talks with the moldovan government . the tiny border region , which represents nearly one eighth of moldova 's territory but houses 40 percent of its industry , first declared its independence in 1990 .
moldova has offered the separatist area autonomy but not independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-dniester firrst declared its independence in 1990 following the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , civil war broke out in trans-dniester .

spokespeople for the ukrainian government have reported annual losses of some two billion dollars through smuggling across the disputed region . elites in moldova and ukraine benefit significantly from the illegal border trade , but the reform-oriented parties in kiev chisinau are out to change that - and they asked the eu for help . in response , the eu 's border assistance mission to moldova and ukraine -lrb- eubam -rrb- has been actively patrolling the border since march with around 100 officers . illegal trade of arms , drugs , humans - and chickens with some 20,000 tons of weapons and munitions being held in trans-dniester under the supervision of russia soldiers , arms smuggling is common .
drugs and even humans are frequently trafficked across the border as well , but border patrols have discovered more chicken meat than anything else . " the density of the border patrol team has been increased , but that does n't mean that smuggling has stopped .
the smugglers are opponents we have to take seriously and we often have to use weapons .
they continually destroy our surveillance system during the night , " said vitale povodin from the ukrainian border police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics warn the referendum could set a precedence for other pro-russian provinces russia has publicly expressed support for trans-dniester 's annexation in the russian federation .
foreign minister sergei lavrov called sunday 's referendum a " reaction to the blockade against trans-dniester , which the economy and the residents of the region suffer under , " referring to recent border patrol efforts . however , moldova 's prime minister vasile tarlev said , " a family clan is ruling in trans-dniester .

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .
perhaps a sign to others to imitate the pope : to exchange intolerance and arrogance for humanity , modesty and reason ?
and to do everything they can to smooth the waves of indignation ? peter philipp is an expert on middle east affairs and deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . peter philipp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope makes personal apology to muslims pope benedict xvi said he was " deeply sorry " sunday for outrage triggered across the muslim world by remarks he made about islam and stressed they had not reflected his personal opinion .

voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .
neo-nazis enter fourth state parliament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo pastörs -lrb- r . -rrb- , candidate for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania this now makes the economically depressed state the fourth regional legislature where an extreme right party is represented : ; the npd also sits in saxony 's parliament while the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- is represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg and bremen .
mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .
once asked about the disastrous state of berlin 's finances , wowi , as he is affectionately called by his supporters , memorably declared : ' berlin may be poor .
but it 's sexy . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , state premier ringstorff left open the possibility of renewing his coalition with the left party or forming an alliance with the christian democrats , which would mirror the grand coalition of the spd-cdu on a national level . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .

meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .
perhaps a sign to others to imitate the pope : to exchange intolerance and arrogance for humanity , modesty and reason ?

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .
i do n't expect that his vacation will be moved to bavaria . have you talked to your brother si n ce his retur n to rome ? we have talked on the phone . has he talked to you about the co n troversy surrou n di n g his speech at the u n iversity of rege n sburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg ratzinger he mentioned it briefly .
of course he regrets that muslims have reacted like that and have completely misunderstood him .
it 's not his opinion .
he would never hold such a view .
it 's the quote of a man , who lived 500 years ago .
naturally , it 's a grotesque misunderstanding that it was taken out of context and presented as if it were his opinion .
but he hopes that it will be sorted out and understood when he explains the situation correctly - and that it wo n't have consequences for mutual relations . mathis winkler interviewed georg ratzinger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : latest clash of cultures should be laid to rest the pope 's apology sunday was accepted by some muslim leaders but outraged other radical groups even more .

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .

the eu has sent border police there to fight smuggling but wo n't recognize independence . according to election reports in tiraspol , the declared capital of trans-dniester , 97.1 percent of referendum participants voted " yes " on sunday to the suggestive referendum question posed by self-declared president igor smirnov : " do you support a path of independence for the moldovan trans-dniester republic and its future accession to the russian federation ? " some 78 percent of the approximately 550,000 residents in the russian-speaking region located between the western border of ukraine and the dniester river turned out for the referendum . little recognition of independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-dniester does not share a border with russia trans-dniester is still officially a part of europe-oriented , romanian-speaking moldova .
prior to the referendum , the european union , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and moldova declared trans-dniester 's proposed succession illegal and refused to recognize its independence . " the referendum negates all the efforts of the moldovan leadership to resolve the conflict , " said moldovan president vladimir voronin . trans-dniester 's leaders , on the other hand , said they were optimistic that the referendum results would strengthen their position in talks with the moldovan government . the tiny border region , which represents nearly one eighth of moldova 's territory but houses 40 percent of its industry , first declared its independence in 1990 .
moldova has offered the separatist area autonomy but not independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-dniester firrst declared its independence in 1990 following the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , civil war broke out in trans-dniester .
russian soldiers intervened to stop the fighting and have been there ever since , despite protests from the moldovan government . eu mission to fight smuggling as a border region , smuggling through trans-dniester has been one of the major concerns for both moldova and the ukraine but also for europe as a whole .
spokespeople for the ukrainian government have reported annual losses of some two billion dollars through smuggling across the disputed region . elites in moldova and ukraine benefit significantly from the illegal border trade , but the reform-oriented parties in kiev chisinau are out to change that - and they asked the eu for help . in response , the eu 's border assistance mission to moldova and ukraine -lrb- eubam -rrb- has been actively patrolling the border since march with around 100 officers . illegal trade of arms , drugs , humans - and chickens with some 20,000 tons of weapons and munitions being held in trans-dniester under the supervision of russia soldiers , arms smuggling is common .
drugs and even humans are frequently trafficked across the border as well , but border patrols have discovered more chicken meat than anything else . " the density of the border patrol team has been increased , but that does n't mean that smuggling has stopped .
the smugglers are opponents we have to take seriously and we often have to use weapons .
they continually destroy our surveillance system during the night , " said vitale povodin from the ukrainian border police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics warn the referendum could set a precedence for other pro-russian provinces russia has publicly expressed support for trans-dniester 's annexation in the russian federation .
foreign minister sergei lavrov called sunday 's referendum a " reaction to the blockade against trans-dniester , which the economy and the residents of the region suffer under , " referring to recent border patrol efforts . however , moldova 's prime minister vasile tarlev said , " a family clan is ruling in trans-dniester . "
he added that president igor smirnov 's younger son produces weapons and delivers them to all the crisis regions in the world .
" this is dangerous not only for moldova and ukraine but also for europe and the whole world .

the returns represented a significant increase compared to the state 's previous election , in which they received less than one percent of the votes . the gains also mean that the npd , which caters to the frustrations and anti-foreigner sentiments of the unemployed in germany 's poorest state , now is represented in four german state legislatures .
for the german press , the far-right victory is cause for sounding the alarm bells . easterners unimpressed by democracy " in the interests of democracy , one should not underestimate the success of the npd . what is nightmarish is the finding that half of the voters in the eastern part of germany are unimpressed by democratic principles and freedoms that are valued in the west , " proclaimed the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , based in the industrial ruhr valley . npd party is reminiscent of the nazis the liberal süddeutsche zeitung likened the npd to adolf hitler 's national socialists and warned that the neo-nazi party is a greater threat than other far right parties in europe , because " germany is in the situation of a dry alcoholic , who is experiencing a relapse , which makes it problematic to wait until they simply self-destruct out of their own stupidity . " the munich-based daily added that the npd party is young , well-organized and maintains the façade of respectability by championing small causes , such as the protest against rising utility costs .
npd addresses everyday concerns of voters another national newspaper , the frankfurter rundschau proclaimed , " faced with this election result , we must be particularly concerned about the fact that over the last few years the npd has managed to penetrate society , in particular in eastern germany .
-lrb- they -rrb- organize children 's fetes , youth concerts , and distribute cds outside schools . "
according to berlin 's tagesspiegel , " the npd has achieved its goal , side by side with the left party and the social democrats , to establish themselves as a party for the small everyday man . "
it added that npd voters can no longer be dismissed as misguided , but essentially decent people after the " atmosphere of violence and intimidation " surrounding the party 's election campaign in berlin .
but the newspaper made no excuses for such voters .

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .
i do n't expect that his vacation will be moved to bavaria . have you talked to your brother si n ce his retur n to rome ? we have talked on the phone . has he talked to you about the co n troversy surrou n di n g his speech at the u n iversity of rege n sburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg ratzinger he mentioned it briefly .
of course he regrets that muslims have reacted like that and have completely misunderstood him .
it 's not his opinion .
he would never hold such a view .
it 's the quote of a man , who lived 500 years ago .
naturally , it 's a grotesque misunderstanding that it was taken out of context and presented as if it were his opinion .
but he hopes that it will be sorted out and understood when he explains the situation correctly - and that it wo n't have consequences for mutual relations . mathis winkler interviewed georg ratzinger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : latest clash of cultures should be laid to rest the pope 's apology sunday was accepted by some muslim leaders but outraged other radical groups even more .
his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp .

voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .

mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , state premier ringstorff left open the possibility of renewing his coalition with the left party or forming an alliance with the christian democrats , which would mirror the grand coalition of the spd-cdu on a national level . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .

the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .

"
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .

" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .

voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .
i do n't expect that his vacation will be moved to bavaria . have you talked to your brother si n ce his retur n to rome ? we have talked on the phone . has he talked to you about the co n troversy surrou n di n g his speech at the u n iversity of rege n sburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg ratzinger he mentioned it briefly .
of course he regrets that muslims have reacted like that and have completely misunderstood him .
it 's not his opinion .
he would never hold such a view .
it 's the quote of a man , who lived 500 years ago .
naturally , it 's a grotesque misunderstanding that it was taken out of context and presented as if it were his opinion .
but he hopes that it will be sorted out and understood when he explains the situation correctly - and that it wo n't have consequences for mutual relations . mathis winkler interviewed georg ratzinger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : latest clash of cultures should be laid to rest the pope 's apology sunday was accepted by some muslim leaders but outraged other radical groups even more .

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .
perhaps a sign to others to imitate the pope : to exchange intolerance and arrogance for humanity , modesty and reason ?

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .
perhaps a sign to others to imitate the pope : to exchange intolerance and arrogance for humanity , modesty and reason ?
and to do everything they can to smooth the waves of indignation ? peter philipp is an expert on middle east affairs and deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . peter philipp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope makes personal apology to muslims pope benedict xvi said he was " deeply sorry " sunday for outrage triggered across the muslim world by remarks he made about islam and stressed they had not reflected his personal opinion .

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .

the eu has sent border police there to fight smuggling but wo n't recognize independence . according to election reports in tiraspol , the declared capital of trans-dniester , 97.1 percent of referendum participants voted " yes " on sunday to the suggestive referendum question posed by self-declared president igor smirnov : " do you support a path of independence for the moldovan trans-dniester republic and its future accession to the russian federation ? " some 78 percent of the approximately 550,000 residents in the russian-speaking region located between the western border of ukraine and the dniester river turned out for the referendum . little recognition of independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-dniester does not share a border with russia trans-dniester is still officially a part of europe-oriented , romanian-speaking moldova .
prior to the referendum , the european union , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and moldova declared trans-dniester 's proposed succession illegal and refused to recognize its independence . " the referendum negates all the efforts of the moldovan leadership to resolve the conflict , " said moldovan president vladimir voronin . trans-dniester 's leaders , on the other hand , said they were optimistic that the referendum results would strengthen their position in talks with the moldovan government . the tiny border region , which represents nearly one eighth of moldova 's territory but houses 40 percent of its industry , first declared its independence in 1990 .
moldova has offered the separatist area autonomy but not independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trans-dniester firrst declared its independence in 1990 following the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , civil war broke out in trans-dniester .
russian soldiers intervened to stop the fighting and have been there ever since , despite protests from the moldovan government . eu mission to fight smuggling as a border region , smuggling through trans-dniester has been one of the major concerns for both moldova and the ukraine but also for europe as a whole .
spokespeople for the ukrainian government have reported annual losses of some two billion dollars through smuggling across the disputed region . elites in moldova and ukraine benefit significantly from the illegal border trade , but the reform-oriented parties in kiev chisinau are out to change that - and they asked the eu for help . in response , the eu 's border assistance mission to moldova and ukraine -lrb- eubam -rrb- has been actively patrolling the border since march with around 100 officers . illegal trade of arms , drugs , humans - and chickens with some 20,000 tons of weapons and munitions being held in trans-dniester under the supervision of russia soldiers , arms smuggling is common .
drugs and even humans are frequently trafficked across the border as well , but border patrols have discovered more chicken meat than anything else . " the density of the border patrol team has been increased , but that does n't mean that smuggling has stopped .
the smugglers are opponents we have to take seriously and we often have to use weapons .
they continually destroy our surveillance system during the night , " said vitale povodin from the ukrainian border police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics warn the referendum could set a precedence for other pro-russian provinces russia has publicly expressed support for trans-dniester 's annexation in the russian federation .
foreign minister sergei lavrov called sunday 's referendum a " reaction to the blockade against trans-dniester , which the economy and the residents of the region suffer under , " referring to recent border patrol efforts . however , moldova 's prime minister vasile tarlev said , " a family clan is ruling in trans-dniester . "
he added that president igor smirnov 's younger son produces weapons and delivers them to all the crisis regions in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2006 press review : alarm bells ring over support for far right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national democratic party is now represented in four state legislatures after the far-right national democratic party took 7.3 percent of the vote in mecklenburg-western pomerania , the german press started ringing alarm bells . on sunday , the far-right nationalist party gained 7.3 percent of the vote in the economically depressed northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the returns represented a significant increase compared to the state 's previous election , in which they received less than one percent of the votes . the gains also mean that the npd , which caters to the frustrations and anti-foreigner sentiments of the unemployed in germany 's poorest state , now is represented in four german state legislatures .
for the german press , the far-right victory is cause for sounding the alarm bells . easterners unimpressed by democracy " in the interests of democracy , one should not underestimate the success of the npd . what is nightmarish is the finding that half of the voters in the eastern part of germany are unimpressed by democratic principles and freedoms that are valued in the west , " proclaimed the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , based in the industrial ruhr valley . npd party is reminiscent of the nazis the liberal süddeutsche zeitung likened the npd to adolf hitler 's national socialists and warned that the neo-nazi party is a greater threat than other far right parties in europe , because " germany is in the situation of a dry alcoholic , who is experiencing a relapse , which makes it problematic to wait until they simply self-destruct out of their own stupidity . " the munich-based daily added that the npd party is young , well-organized and maintains the façade of respectability by championing small causes , such as the protest against rising utility costs .
npd addresses everyday concerns of voters another national newspaper , the frankfurter rundschau proclaimed , " faced with this election result , we must be particularly concerned about the fact that over the last few years the npd has managed to penetrate society , in particular in eastern germany .
-lrb- they -rrb- organize children 's fetes , youth concerts , and distribute cds outside schools . "
according to berlin 's tagesspiegel , " the npd has achieved its goal , side by side with the left party and the social democrats , to establish themselves as a party for the small everyday man . "
it added that npd voters can no longer be dismissed as misguided , but essentially decent people after the " atmosphere of violence and intimidation " surrounding the party 's election campaign in berlin .
but the newspaper made no excuses for such voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2006 far-right enter fourth german state legislature großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right npd - shown here at a march in may - made significant gains in sunday 's election .
voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .
neo-nazis enter fourth state parliament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo pastörs -lrb- r . -rrb- , candidate for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania this now makes the economically depressed state the fourth regional legislature where an extreme right party is represented : ; the npd also sits in saxony 's parliament while the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- is represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg and bremen .
mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .
once asked about the disastrous state of berlin 's finances , wowi , as he is affectionately called by his supporters , memorably declared : ' berlin may be poor .
but it 's sexy . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , state premier ringstorff left open the possibility of renewing his coalition with the left party or forming an alliance with the christian democrats , which would mirror the grand coalition of the spd-cdu on a national level . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .
i do n't expect that his vacation will be moved to bavaria . have you talked to your brother si n ce his retur n to rome ? we have talked on the phone . has he talked to you about the co n troversy surrou n di n g his speech at the u n iversity of rege n sburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg ratzinger he mentioned it briefly .
of course he regrets that muslims have reacted like that and have completely misunderstood him .
it 's not his opinion .
he would never hold such a view .
it 's the quote of a man , who lived 500 years ago .
naturally , it 's a grotesque misunderstanding that it was taken out of context and presented as if it were his opinion .
but he hopes that it will be sorted out and understood when he explains the situation correctly - and that it wo n't have consequences for mutual relations . mathis winkler interviewed georg ratzinger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : latest clash of cultures should be laid to rest the pope 's apology sunday was accepted by some muslim leaders but outraged other radical groups even more .
his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp .

voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .

mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .
once asked about the disastrous state of berlin 's finances , wowi , as he is affectionately called by his supporters , memorably declared : ' berlin may be poor .
but it 's sexy . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , state premier ringstorff left open the possibility of renewing his coalition with the left party or forming an alliance with the christian democrats , which would mirror the grand coalition of the spd-cdu on a national level . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .

the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .
once asked about the disastrous state of berlin 's finances , wowi , as he is affectionately called by his supporters , memorably declared : ' berlin may be poor .
but it 's sexy . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , state premier ringstorff left open the possibility of renewing his coalition with the left party or forming an alliance with the christian democrats , which would mirror the grand coalition of the spd-cdu on a national level . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .

and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .
i do n't expect that his vacation will be moved to bavaria . have you talked to your brother si n ce his retur n to rome ? we have talked on the phone . has he talked to you about the co n troversy surrou n di n g his speech at the u n iversity of rege n sburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg ratzinger he mentioned it briefly .
of course he regrets that muslims have reacted like that and have completely misunderstood him .
it 's not his opinion .
he would never hold such a view .
it 's the quote of a man , who lived 500 years ago .
naturally , it 's a grotesque misunderstanding that it was taken out of context and presented as if it were his opinion .
but he hopes that it will be sorted out and understood when he explains the situation correctly - and that it wo n't have consequences for mutual relations . mathis winkler interviewed georg ratzinger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : latest clash of cultures should be laid to rest the pope 's apology sunday was accepted by some muslim leaders but outraged other radical groups even more .

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .
perhaps a sign to others to imitate the pope : to exchange intolerance and arrogance for humanity , modesty and reason ?
and to do everything they can to smooth the waves of indignation ? peter philipp is an expert on middle east affairs and deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . peter philipp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope makes personal apology to muslims pope benedict xvi said he was " deeply sorry " sunday for outrage triggered across the muslim world by remarks he made about islam and stressed they had not reflected his personal opinion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2006 far-right enter fourth german state legislature großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right npd - shown here at a march in may - made significant gains in sunday 's election .
voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .
neo-nazis enter fourth state parliament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo pastörs -lrb- r . -rrb- , candidate for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania this now makes the economically depressed state the fourth regional legislature where an extreme right party is represented : ; the npd also sits in saxony 's parliament while the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- is represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg and bremen .
mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .
once asked about the disastrous state of berlin 's finances , wowi , as he is affectionately called by his supporters , memorably declared : ' berlin may be poor .
but it 's sexy . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , state premier ringstorff left open the possibility of renewing his coalition with the left party or forming an alliance with the christian democrats , which would mirror the grand coalition of the spd-cdu on a national level . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .

while some said that her execution could have been sparked by outrage over the pope 's remarks , local muslim leaders said that somali warlords were responsible for the murder , according to news reports . iran meanwhile was unmoved by sunday 's apology , saying it was not abject enough and called on the 79-year-old pontiff to admit he had made a mistake .

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .

he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .

of course he regrets that muslims have reacted like that and have completely misunderstood him .

voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .
neo-nazis enter fourth state parliament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo pastörs -lrb- r . -rrb- , candidate for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania this now makes the economically depressed state the fourth regional legislature where an extreme right party is represented : ; the npd also sits in saxony 's parliament while the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- is represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg and bremen .
mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .
once asked about the disastrous state of berlin 's finances , wowi , as he is affectionately called by his supporters , memorably declared : ' berlin may be poor .
but it 's sexy . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , state premier ringstorff left open the possibility of renewing his coalition with the left party or forming an alliance with the christian democrats , which would mirror the grand coalition of the spd-cdu on a national level . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .

voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .

it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , state premier ringstorff left open the possibility of renewing his coalition with the left party or forming an alliance with the christian democrats , which would mirror the grand coalition of the spd-cdu on a national level . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .

his words were a sign of human greatness to be imitated in this clash of cultures , writes dw 's peter philipp . the latest events , which are on their way to becoming a new storm in the frequently mentioned and much discussed clash of cultures , should be buried as quickly as possible .
the pope has made it clear that he did n't mean what some people in istanbul , islamabad , tehran and other places heard in his regensburg speech . rather than leaving it to a vatican spokesperson , he gave a public explanation himself .
and that should have been the end of the newest conflict between the muslim world and the " christian occident . " the lack of comprehension , irritation and even agitation that became apparent in the muslim countries was understandable .
even though the head of the catholic church only quoted a text that was several centuries old and called the antagonistic passages " surprisingly blunt , " he should have realized that a shortened - and therefore easily misunderstood - version of the quote would be widely circulated . and if it appeared so quickly on german television , how much more momentous was it in the muslim world ? poor counsel on both sides of the fence the pope had been poorly advised to use this quote .
but those who immediately engaged in official protests , condemned the pope or only demanded an official apology from him were likewise poorly counseled . some regularly take advantage of every possible opportunity to spread tales of western arrogance toward islam .
this time , the outrage was even greater , which made it all the more important for the pope to achieve clarity . it would be good if both sides also saw it this way - especially the protagonists on both sides of the culture clash , who seek the opponent 's submission rather than dialogue , understanding and compromise . it would also be good if - perhaps with the church 's help - this " against each other " became " with each other . " there have been misinterpretations on both sides for centuries , which is evident from the objectionable quote .
too much blood has already been spilled for this very reason under the pretence of religion - even when the deeds clearly contradicted the religion . pope 's statement exceeded expectations of some for the " infallible representative of god on earth " - which is how catholics view the pope - sunday 's explanation and expression of regret were more than could have been expected . it was n't the prostration that had been demanded , but a sign of human greatness .

perhaps a sign to others to imitate the pope : to exchange intolerance and arrogance for humanity , modesty and reason ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2006 far-right enter fourth german state legislature großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right npd - shown here at a march in may - made significant gains in sunday 's election .
voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .

meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .

mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2006 pope 's brother : " he hopes that it will be sorted out " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratzinger accompanied his brother for four days , but the brothers had little private time in his first interview since benedict xvi 's visit to bavaria , the pope 's brother talks about the trip , papal vacation plans and the pontiff 's reaction to muslim protests against his speech in regensburg . on sunday , a vatican flag with the papal coat of arms still flew outside georg ratzinger 's home in the center of the bavarian town of regensburg , where benedict xvi had visited his 82-year-old brother last wednesday .
ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .
in fact , things turned out differently .
it was solemn and somehow even cheerful , if i may say so .
i was deeply moved . did you have a favorite mome n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and his brother in front of the grave where their parents and sister are buried in regensburg it was especially nice for me that we were allowed to be alone for about two hours in his house in pentling , of course .
he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .
that was nice .
but it 's trivial to emphasize this vis-à-vis the church services , which are quintessential for people and which grip people internally .
i thought that all festivities were well prepared .
they gave people an emotional religious experience , an experience of religious commitment .
that 's how i really experienced it . the bavaria n bishops have asked the pope to spe n d his vacatio n i n bavaria i n the future .
do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .

ratzinger , himself a priest and the former director of regensburg 's world-famous cathedral boys ' choir , the regensburger domspatzen , will probably not see the pope until after christmas , when he plans to travel to rome again .
but the brothers regularly talk on the phone , allowing ratzinger to share benedict 's thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in this exclusive interview . dw-world.de : how did you experie n ce your brother 's visit to bavaria ? georg ratzinger : i expected everything to be very flustered and hounded .

he was tired and got some rest and we chatted a bit .

do you thi n k that 's possible ? i 've heard that several vacation spots have been checked - mainly in south tyrol , where we frequently spent our vacation .
all of them did n't work out because of the people that are responsible for security .
there were shortfalls everywhere that made the security people say : this is not acceptable .
i think that the vacation in the aosta valley - in relative solitude and with a very good and healthy climate - has worked out well .

the returns represented a significant increase compared to the state 's previous election , in which they received less than one percent of the votes . the gains also mean that the npd , which caters to the frustrations and anti-foreigner sentiments of the unemployed in germany 's poorest state , now is represented in four german state legislatures .
for the german press , the far-right victory is cause for sounding the alarm bells . easterners unimpressed by democracy " in the interests of democracy , one should not underestimate the success of the npd . what is nightmarish is the finding that half of the voters in the eastern part of germany are unimpressed by democratic principles and freedoms that are valued in the west , " proclaimed the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , based in the industrial ruhr valley . npd party is reminiscent of the nazis the liberal süddeutsche zeitung likened the npd to adolf hitler 's national socialists and warned that the neo-nazi party is a greater threat than other far right parties in europe , because " germany is in the situation of a dry alcoholic , who is experiencing a relapse , which makes it problematic to wait until they simply self-destruct out of their own stupidity . " the munich-based daily added that the npd party is young , well-organized and maintains the façade of respectability by championing small causes , such as the protest against rising utility costs .
npd addresses everyday concerns of voters another national newspaper , the frankfurter rundschau proclaimed , " faced with this election result , we must be particularly concerned about the fact that over the last few years the npd has managed to penetrate society , in particular in eastern germany .
-lrb- they -rrb- organize children 's fetes , youth concerts , and distribute cds outside schools . "
according to berlin 's tagesspiegel , " the npd has achieved its goal , side by side with the left party and the social democrats , to establish themselves as a party for the small everyday man . "
it added that npd voters can no longer be dismissed as misguided , but essentially decent people after the " atmosphere of violence and intimidation " surrounding the party 's election campaign in berlin .
but the newspaper made no excuses for such voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2006 far-right enter fourth german state legislature großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right npd - shown here at a march in may - made significant gains in sunday 's election .
voters dealt german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives a bitter blow in regional elections which saw the neo-nazis make a stunning breakthrough in her home state .
the social democrats came out ahead in berlin . in two regional elections on sunday , voters dealt a bitter blow to angela merkel 's conservative party in the city-state of berlin and the eastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which also happens to be where the german chancellor 's constituency is based .
merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- scored their worst results in the german capital since the founding of the federal republic in 1949 , trailing behind the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- by nine percentage points .
polls indicate that the cdu 's popularity has eroded nationwide over plans to hike taxes and reform germany 's health care system .
meanwhile the two clear victors in the elections were berlin 's charismatic mayor klaus wowereit , who led the spd to first place with over 30 percent of the vote , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the neo-nazi national democratic party which won 7.3 percent of the vote , far more than the five-percent threshold required for parliamentary representation .
neo-nazis enter fourth state parliament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo pastörs -lrb- r . -rrb- , candidate for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania this now makes the economically depressed state the fourth regional legislature where an extreme right party is represented : ; the npd also sits in saxony 's parliament while the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- is represented in the state legislatures of brandenburg and bremen .
mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is on the baltic coast bordering poland , is one of germany 's poorest regions with an unemployment rate of 18.2 percent , nearly double the national average .
the former communist states have never caught up to the west economically since german reunification in 1990 , strengthening the appeal of the npd party , which has been able to capitalize on the disaffection among jobless youth with its crude anti-immigrant , racist platform .
harald ringstorff , 66 , the incumbent social democrat state premier , whose party won by a margin , said he would " handle things with the npd in a democratic way and get rid of the party in the next elections . "
on the other hand , the npd have not been able to make inroads in berlin .
mayor klaus wowereit , who wrested power from the conservatives in 2001 , remains enormously popular , despite high unemployment and the city 's enormous debt of 58 billion euros -lrb- $ 73 billion -rrb- .
once asked about the disastrous state of berlin 's finances , wowi , as he is affectionately called by his supporters , memorably declared : ' berlin may be poor .
but it 's sexy . '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit celebrates his party 's win in berlin yesterday , wowereit told cheering supporters , " i am happy that the people of berlin have voted in favor of democracy and did not elect the npd into the state 's parliament . "
coalition possibilities still open his party 's strong showing will now allow the berlin mayor to form a ruling coalition of his choice , which could include either the greens or the left party .
both the greens and the left party , a mish-mash of former communists and leftist spd defectors , won 13 percent of the vote each .
on monday morning , wowereit ruled out the possibility of a three-way , red-red-green coalition of the social democrats , the left party and the greens .
" one should avoid such a constellation if possible .
it would be too complicated , " said wowereit in an interview with the german news agency , dpa . the berlin mayor declined to say if he would continue governing with the left party in a red-red coalition or seek a new partnership with the greens .
" we have common ground with both parties , " he said .
the greens , which made gains of four percent from the last state elections in 2001 , have said they have earned the mandate to govern with the social democrats , whereas voter support for the left party dropped dramatically from 22.6 percent to 13.4 percent .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , state premier ringstorff left open the possibility of renewing his coalition with the left party or forming an alliance with the christian democrats , which would mirror the grand coalition of the spd-cdu on a national level . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .

guy wood , 47 , told bbc radio 's eye on wales he became ill if went into the new house in fishguard , pembrokeshire , where his wife and daughter live .
he says it forces him to stay with friends nearby in older properties .
his housing association has refurbished another house with eco-friendly paint and he hopes to move in this week .
mr wood has a condition known as multiple chemical sensitivity -lrb- mcs -rrb- .
it means that he is acutely sensitive to very low levels of chemicals which do not normally affect other people .
he said the chemicals in the glues , paints and varnishes used to build and decorate properties left him disorientated and dizzy .
many common domestic products such as air fresheners , soaps , washing powders , flame-retardant fabrics have the same effect .
solid walls the family home is in a new-build housing association property in scleddau , near fishguard , where his wife , jo , and daughter , seren , three , live without any problem .
but mr wood said he could even enter the building without falling ill , and had given up trying to live in the house .
whenever he visits , he stays in the back garden .
his family try to minimise the risk of him having a reaction when they meet , even keeping their clothes packed in plastic bags to stop them being impregnated with any chemicals present in the house .
common domestic products can cause allergies in some people for the past 18 months , mr wood has stayed with a variety of local friends living in older homes of a more traditional construction , such as solid walls .
he said : " life was never meant to be like this .
i can hardly find any shoes to wear because of all the chemicals in the soles .
" i do n't want to be moaning and disempowered , i want to raise the profile of it as much as i can .
" this is really the last gasp .
everything hinges on this house , because i ca n't ask any more of my housing association . "
mr wood has a history of chronic fatigue syndrome and was showing signs of his chemical sensitivity before his housing difficulties .
paints and primers mcs is a controversial area of medicine , with a body of opinion that it is more of a psychiatric problem rather than a physical one .
mr wood was eventually referred to dr sarah myhill , who is based near knighton , powys , and specialises in fatigue conditions .
she diagnosed mr wood with mcs .
dr myhill said mcs affected fewer than 0.5 % of the population but for those with such sensitivity it " makes their lives impossible " .
she said : " one part-treatment is to remove the load of chemicals in the body and that i do by sweating regimes - saunas are a very good way of getting chemical out of the body .
" i do fat biopsies to measure the levels of chemicals in the body before the sweating regimes and i do that afterwards and demonstrate the level of chemicals coming down . "
housing association cymdeithas tai cantref said it was spending about £ 2,000 extra on the refurbishment of a vacant property thought suitable for the wood family .
the main differences include the use of eco-friendly paints and primers , cork flooring and untreated radiators , said the association 's technical services david watkins .
he said : " the subtle differences are in the materials used , mainly of an organic base , and making sure that the existence of traditional gloss paints , particularly new gloss finishes , were sealed with material of an organic nature which was environmentally friendly and did n't off-gas in a way that will affect mr wood 's health .

so much so you would think this , one of the world 's biggest sporting events , was happening in wales this week , rather than at the k club outside dublin .
a big team of officials and consultants has been amassed to pilot the route towards hosting the event at newport 's celtic manor resort in 2010 .
by then close to £ 50m will have been spent by welsh assembly government bodies on the preparations .
some of that cash will be spent this week having a large presence in ireland .
some 25 people will be there from so-called " team wales " : officials from the assembly , local authorities and other bodies which have an interest in promoting the nation among investors , tour operators and anyone else who 'll listen .
billionaire sir terry matthews is behind wales ' ryder cup win the welsh have a great opportunity in ireland , as it 's traditional to make a fuss of the ryder cup 's next hosts .
so the assembly government 's taking 225 guests to the three-day event .
these are people from blue-chip companies , tourism and celebrities .
the festivities will include a wales golf day and a gala dinner attended by welsh enterprise minister andrew davies , irish politicians and business people .
but will all this effort and public money pay off for what is just a one-off , three-day tournament ?
calvin jones , of cardiff 's business school is not so sure .
he said : " i do n't think it 'll do for us what the fa cup has done for cardiff .
newport 's so close to the english border , it 'll be a challenge to make sure the benefits are captured mainly for wales . '
ryder cup wales , which is organising the event here , sees it differently .
graham moore , one of its board members , said that despite being a brief tournament , it attracted 150,000 people and a huge worldwide audience .
most importantly , he said , golf attracted business people .
he said : " potential investors from all over the world will be descending on newport for the cup .
we 'll get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to persuade them to do future business in newport and wales . "
golf is seen as a way of putting wales on the tourist map with the eyes of the golfing / business world on newport , there 'll also be a rare chance to showcase globally the city and wales as a destination for tourism .
so making sure the event goes off without any hitches will be vital .
ensuring newport looks its best will also be important .
by 2010 , some £ 400m , most of it from the private sector , will have been spent on transforming newport 's dilapidated centre .
this makeover was planned well before the ryder cup came on the scene , but the 2010 date is now providing a deadline and a catalyst for the work .
redevelopment john burrows , who as chief executive of newport unlimited is spearheading the redevelopment of the city , said the area was already benefiting from the cup .
" film crews from us networks have been here to look around .
people are already coming to the celtic manor resort to play the course and they 'll be coming after the tournament too .
" they 're staying in hotels and creating demand for products and services .
and valderrama proves the tournament 's not a flash in the pan - americans are still visiting the place , playing golf there in big numbers nine years after the spaniards hosted the cup . "
so the golf may be a three-day wonder , but it is the long game that matters .
and officials believe they have already made a good start .

manasseh sogavare said he feared a repeat of clashes earlier this year because an australian-led security force sent to end unrest had failed .
his comments are the latest in an escalating row between the two countries over the april riots .
australia wants the honiara government to cancel an inquiry into the violence .
the government 's critics fear the inquiry will be used to exonerate two pro-sogavare lawmakers .
mr sogavare has refused , and australia 's top diplomat in honiara , patrick cole , was expelled from the solomons last week , accused of interfering in the riot investigation .
canberra responded by threatening to restrict visa rights for solomon politicians who wanted to travel to australia .
' heavy-handed ' in a nationally televised address , mr sogavare said the australian-led security forces in the solomons had not dealt properly with his country 's underlying problems .
he said he was concerned by the " heavy-handed , legalistic approach " that foreign troops were taking to address the situation .
" unless this trend is reversed now , we will be in danger of driving this country down the path of another conflict that could be more serious , " he said .
australia has deployed security forces in the solomons since 2003 , when it was invited there by the government to restore order after the country came close to collapse .
the root of the latest disagreement between australia and the solomons is a police inquiry which mr sogavare has set up , to look into the april riots .
critics accuse him of initiating the police investigation in order to clear two lawmaker allies , who were charged with inciting the riots .
the april violence erupted after an election won by the former deputy prime minister , snyder rini .
thousands of anti-government protesters burned down buildings in the city 's chinese district , alleging that either china or taiwan had paid lawmakers to vote for him .
mr rini resigned when several members of his government - including mr sogavare - defected to the opposition , and mr sogavare was elected prime minister .

manasseh sogavare said he feared a repeat of clashes earlier this year because an australian-led security force sent to end unrest had failed .
his comments are the latest in an escalating row between the two countries over the april riots .
australia wants the honiara government to cancel an inquiry into the violence .
the government 's critics fear the inquiry will be used to exonerate two pro-sogavare lawmakers .
mr sogavare has refused , and australia 's top diplomat in honiara , patrick cole , was expelled from the solomons last week , accused of interfering in the riot investigation .
canberra responded by threatening to restrict visa rights for solomon politicians who wanted to travel to australia .
' heavy-handed ' in a nationally televised address , mr sogavare said the australian-led security forces in the solomons had not dealt properly with his country 's underlying problems .
he said he was concerned by the " heavy-handed , legalistic approach " that foreign troops were taking to address the situation .
" unless this trend is reversed now , we will be in danger of driving this country down the path of another conflict that could be more serious , " he said .
australia has deployed security forces in the solomons since 2003 , when it was invited there by the government to restore order after the country came close to collapse .
the root of the latest disagreement between australia and the solomons is a police inquiry which mr sogavare has set up , to look into the april riots .
critics accuse him of initiating the police investigation in order to clear two lawmaker allies , who were charged with inciting the riots .
the april violence erupted after an election won by the former deputy prime minister , snyder rini .
thousands of anti-government protesters burned down buildings in the city 's chinese district , alleging that either china or taiwan had paid lawmakers to vote for him .
mr rini resigned when several members of his government - including mr sogavare - defected to the opposition , and mr sogavare was elected prime minister .

they say 97.1 % of the voters backed independence and a union with russia in sunday 's referendum .
moldova and the west have dismissed the poll as illegitimate .
trans-dniester declared itself to be independent in 1990 from the soviet republic of moldova - but it has never been recognised internationally .
some european nations believe the area , with a population of about 500,000 people , poses a risk to regional security , and moldova calls it a haven for criminals .
the government in tiraspol insists it should have the right to self-determination .
civil war correspondents say russia has shown no desire to absorb the territory , although it does have 1,200 troops deployed there .
the referendum results were announced by trans-dniester 's central election commission chief pyotr denisenko .
mr denisenko also said 94.6 % voted against abandoning the region 's independence and forming an eventual union with moldova .
the turnout was 78.6 % .
the self-proclaimed republic is a mainly russian-speaking area that fought a bloody civil war with moldova in the early 1990s .
the referendum was held because of growing economic pressure from moldova and neighbouring ukraine as part of an eu project to improve regional security , analysts say .
it could set a precedent for other pro-russian separatist states in the former soviet union , correspondents say .

bbc news examines what this mean for employers and their staff how is the law set to change ?
on 1 october the employment equality -lrb- age -rrb- regulations 2006 come into force .
the upshot of this eu inspired law is that it will be unlawful to discriminate against workers under the age of 65 on the grounds of age .
making someone redundant or barring workers from training or promotion because they are too old - or too young - will be illegal .
as they approach 65 , workers will have to be given six months notice that their employer wants them to give up their job and retire .
the employee will be allowed to request to continue working , however , employers will be able to refuse this request without giving a reason in writing .
my father , who is his fifties , lost his job recently .
will this new law make it easier for him to find employment ?
age discrimination law workers can not be sacked for being too old or too young , as long as they are under 65 workers will have the right to request that they work beyond age 65 employers will have to give their staff six months notice of when they expect them to retire ageist recruiting practices are to be outlawed employers will have to treat all workers equally when it comes to training , regardless of age it depends .
in future , firms are not supposed to refuse employment to the under 65s on the grounds of age .
therefore , if your father applies for a job and is told he is too old then that will be a clear cut case of discrimination .
in addition , it will be unlawful to specify an ideal applicants age in job advertising , even using words like " energetic " may be considered ageist and discriminatory .
but age campaigners recognise that it will take a long time for ingrained ageist attitudes to change .
there is still likely to be many industries where being young will still be a distinct advantage in terms of recruitment , promotion and training .
are there any industries which are exempt from the forthcoming age law ?
industries where retirement before 65 can be " objectively justified " will be exempt .
justification may come from the physical nature of the job .
for example , it is difficult to imagine a 65-year-old being able to work as a firefighter .
but there are less clear-cut cases which may only be tested in law .
simon briault , spokesman at the federation of small businesses , cited the example of a clothes shop targeting teenage girls wanting to employ people of a similar age .
how would a tribunal look at such an approach ?
most uk industries , though , will not be exempt from the age law .
some industries , such as advertising and the media - which have something of a reputation for ingrained ageist hiring and firing policies - will have to mend their ways .
could this lead to a rash of employment tribunal cases ?
recruitment bodies have warned employers to be braced for a surge in the number of unfair dismissal cases as a result of the new law .
their concerns may well be justified , if you consider the experience of ireland , which adopted similar age laws in 1998 , and where tribunal cases are on the rise .
but denmark , which adopted similar legislation in 2004 , has only seen two tribunal cases brought on the grounds of age discrimination .
viv du-feu , international head of employment at law firm eversheds , told bbc news that the danish experience showed that it takes a while for workers to become aware of their new rights .
in short , there is likely to be time-lag between the law coming into force and age discrimination cases being brought .
in the longer term , experts have suggested that the number of age discrimination cases will level out as firms amend their employment practices .
does all this mean that i am not allowed to retire early ?
it means nothing of the sort .
you are free to retire any time you choose , if you can afford it .
if , for example , you are lucky enough to have a pension which pays benefits at 60 you can resign from your job - in effect retire - and live off your pension .
one thing that may change , though , is the trend for firms to coax employees into retiring early .
a firm which decides , off its own bat , to offer older workers early retirement - rather than offer voluntary redundancy to all staff - may find itself in contravention of the age law .
why has the law changed ?
between the mid 1970s and 1990s , the proportion of men over the age of 50 in employment fell dramatically .
partly , this was due to the decline of traditional manufacturing industry .
but , in addition , firms and the public sector actively sought to restructure the workforce , getting rid of older staff .
it is widely acknowledged that age discrimination is still endemic in some uk industries .
the problem is that the uk has an ageing population , and in order to pay for pensions people are going to have to work for longer .
age campaigners hope that the new discrimination law will lead to a cultural change , and that older workers will become more valued within the workforce .

bbc news examines what this mean for employers and their staff how is the law set to change ?
on 1 october the employment equality -lrb- age -rrb- regulations 2006 come into force .
the upshot of this eu inspired law is that it will be unlawful to discriminate against workers under the age of 65 on the grounds of age .
making someone redundant or barring workers from training or promotion because they are too old - or too young - will be illegal .
as they approach 65 , workers will have to be given six months notice that their employer wants them to give up their job and retire .
the employee will be allowed to request to continue working , however , employers will be able to refuse this request without giving a reason in writing .
my father , who is his fifties , lost his job recently .
will this new law make it easier for him to find employment ?
age discrimination law workers can not be sacked for being too old or too young , as long as they are under 65 workers will have the right to request that they work beyond age 65 employers will have to give their staff six months notice of when they expect them to retire ageist recruiting practices are to be outlawed employers will have to treat all workers equally when it comes to training , regardless of age it depends .
in future , firms are not supposed to refuse employment to the under 65s on the grounds of age .
therefore , if your father applies for a job and is told he is too old then that will be a clear cut case of discrimination .
in addition , it will be unlawful to specify an ideal applicants age in job advertising , even using words like " energetic " may be considered ageist and discriminatory .
but age campaigners recognise that it will take a long time for ingrained ageist attitudes to change .
there is still likely to be many industries where being young will still be a distinct advantage in terms of recruitment , promotion and training .
firms will have to mind their language in job ads are there any industries which are exempt from the forthcoming age law ?
industries where retirement before 65 can be " objectively justified " will be exempt .
justification may come from the physical nature of the job .
for example , it is difficult to imagine a 65-year-old being able to work as a firefighter .
but there are less clear-cut cases which may only be tested in law .
simon briault , spokesman at the federation of small businesses , cited the example of a clothes shop targeting teenage girls wanting to employ people of a similar age .
how would a tribunal look at such an approach ?
most uk industries , though , will not be exempt from the age law .
some industries , such as advertising and the media - which have something of a reputation for ingrained ageist hiring and firing policies - will have to mend their ways .
could this lead to a rash of employment tribunal cases ?
recruitment bodies have warned employers to be braced for a surge in the number of unfair dismissal cases as a result of the new law .
their concerns may well be justified , if you consider the experience of ireland , which adopted similar age laws in 1998 , and where tribunal cases are on the rise .
but denmark , which adopted similar legislation in 2004 , has only seen two tribunal cases brought on the grounds of age discrimination .
viv du-feu , international head of employment at law firm eversheds , told bbc news that the danish experience showed that it takes a while for workers to become aware of their new rights .
in short , there is likely to be time-lag between the law coming into force and age discrimination cases being brought .
in the longer term , experts have suggested that the number of age discrimination cases will level out as firms amend their employment practices .
does all this mean that i am not allowed to retire early ?
it means nothing of the sort .
you are free to retire any time you choose , if you can afford it .
if , for example , you are lucky enough to have a pension which pays benefits at 60 you can resign from your job - in effect retire - and live off your pension .
one thing that may change , though , is the trend for firms to coax employees into retiring early .
a firm which decides , off its own bat , to offer older workers early retirement - rather than offer voluntary redundancy to all staff - may find itself in contravention of the age law .
why has the law changed ?
between the mid 1970s and 1990s , the proportion of men over the age of 50 in employment fell dramatically .
partly , this was due to the decline of traditional manufacturing industry .
but , in addition , firms and the public sector actively sought to restructure the workforce , getting rid of older staff .
it is widely acknowledged that age discrimination is still endemic in some uk industries .
the problem is that the uk has an ageing population , and in order to pay for pensions people are going to have to work for longer .
age campaigners hope that the new discrimination law will lead to a cultural change , and that older workers will become more valued within the workforce .

doctors found 40 % of patients using botox expressed a compulsive desire for further treatments .
people need to keep having jabs otherwise the effects of the treatment - which paralyses the muscles - rapidly wears off .
the research will be presented at a meeting of the british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons .
it is easy to see how people could become addicted dr carter singh there was a 50 % increase in the number of people treated with botox injections in the uk during 2005 .
mintel , the market research group , estimates more than 100,000 treatments are now given in britain each year .
fear of ageing the study was carried out by dr carter singh , who has a degree in psychology and is based at derbyshire royal infirmary , and the consultant plastic surgeon martin kelly , of london plastic surgery associates .
they surveyed clients at 81 clinics , and compared botox users to people who used other , less invasive beauty treatments .
they found : over 50 % of those who use botox expressed a lack of control over the natural ageing process nearly 50 % expressed anger at people criticising them for botox use over 40 % expressed a compulsive motive for using botox repetitively over 50 % of people using botox reported actually " feeling " younger , rather than just looking younger .
dr singh said regular botox users seemed to have a greater concern about the ageing process , and their inability to control it .
he said : " botox has a good safety profile , but it also has potentially addictive qualities .
" botox changes the physical appearance of a person 's skin or face , and that ultimately leads to improved body image .
" this enhances psychological well-being .
it is easy to see how people could become addicted . "
colin angus , a celebrity agent who has regularly used botox , said : " when i first had it done the changes were tremendous , but i think probably now i have just got used to the way i look .
" in my job , image is very important .
no matter what anybody says , you have to look good . "
botox is a highly purified and much diluted form of the botulism bacterium , responsible for deadly food poisoning .
it blocks the transmission of acetylcholine from the nerves to the muscle .
acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter which send a message to the muscle telling it to contract or tense up .
with the flow of acetylcholine blocked or significantly reduced , the muscle can no longer retract and it relaxes .
as a result , the wrinkled areas smooth out and soften .
however , the effect wears off after four to six months .
women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use botox .

doctors found 40 % of patients using botox expressed a compulsive desire for further treatments .
people need to keep having jabs otherwise the effects of the treatment - which paralyses the muscles - rapidly wears off .
the research will be presented at a meeting of the british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons .
it is easy to see how people could become addicted dr carter singh there was a 50 % increase in the number of people treated with botox injections in the uk during 2005 .
mintel , the market research group , estimates more than 100,000 treatments are now given in britain each year .
fear of ageing the study was carried out by dr carter singh , who has a degree in psychology and is based at derbyshire royal infirmary , and the consultant plastic surgeon martin kelly , of london plastic surgery associates .
they surveyed clients at 81 clinics , and compared botox users to people who used other , less invasive beauty treatments .
they found : over 50 % of those who use botox expressed a lack of control over the natural ageing process nearly 50 % expressed anger at people criticising them for botox use over 40 % expressed a compulsive motive for using botox repetitively over 50 % of people using botox reported actually " feeling " younger , rather than just looking younger .
dr singh said regular botox users seemed to have a greater concern about the ageing process , and their inability to control it .
he said : " botox has a good safety profile , but it also has potentially addictive qualities .
" botox changes the physical appearance of a person 's skin or face , and that ultimately leads to improved body image .
" this enhances psychological well-being .
it is easy to see how people could become addicted . "
colin angus , a celebrity agent who has regularly used botox , said : " when i first had it done the changes were tremendous , but i think probably now i have just got used to the way i look .
" in my job , image is very important .
no matter what anybody says , you have to look good . "
botox is a highly purified and much diluted form of the botulism bacterium , responsible for deadly food poisoning .
it blocks the transmission of acetylcholine from the nerves to the muscle .
acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter which send a message to the muscle telling it to contract or tense up .
with the flow of acetylcholine blocked or significantly reduced , the muscle can no longer retract and it relaxes .
as a result , the wrinkled areas smooth out and soften .
however , the effect wears off after four to six months .
women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use botox .

gridiron gang , starring dwayne " the rock " johnson , took $ 15m -lrb- £ 8m -rrb- in what was a slow weekend for us cinemas .
the black dahlia , based on the 1947 murder of a hollywood actress , opened at number two with $ 10.4m -lrb- £ 5.5m -rrb- .
everyone 's hero , directed by the late christopher reeve , opened in third place with an estimated $ 6.2m -lrb- £ 3.3m -rrb- .
the animated film tells the story of a boy who travels across the country to return a baseball bat to baseball legend babe ruth .
low takings the last kiss , a film about a group of men in their 20s who are afraid to commit , debuted in fourth place with $ 4.7m -lrb- £ 2.5m -rrb- .
the only non-new entry in the top five was last weekend 's box office winner the covenant , which slipped to fifth place .
hollywoodland , starring ben affleck as original superman actor george reeves who apparently shot himself in 1959 , slipped from second place to number nine .

bbc news canvassed a variety of small businesses around the country , to find out their attitude to the new rules .
rob petersen owns an advertising , marketing and pr company .
rob employs four full-time and two part-time staff in cardiff since starting up two years ago .
my profession has a reputation for only employing younger people .
but the days of retiring on a specific date because you are on the scrap heap have gone .
recruitment is going to be a potential problem area because some jobs suit younger people , so the wording of adverts in the future will have to be more careful .
from my point of view , there are a lot of people with a huge amount of experience who are older and who it would be a shame to discriminate against because of their age .
they are more worldly-wise and can deal with people better and that 's a huge advantage i think .
there should quite rightly be a tightening up of the law .
i think it 's very important legislation .
andy hayes , managing director of north offshore in aberdeen .
andy 's company employs 100 staff refurbishing shops , hotels , offices and accommodation on oil rigs .
we are very much aware of it and i do n't think it is going to affect us to any great degree .
a bit more paperwork wo n't make much of a burden .
we have such difficulty finding staff that the legislation wo n't make much difference .
i am very happy taking on people at a senior age because of the wealth of experience they have .
anyone who is good enough , we are desperate to have them .
formally our retirement age is 65 but if someone comes along and says they want to work on and we recognise them as a valued member of our team , we will allow them to do it .
i do n't have the luxury of shoving older workers out of the door .
mike bain runs escape business technologies in aberdeen .
mike 's it and telecoms consultancy has been going for seven years and employs 26 staff .
i do n't think there 's been a clear message about what the legislation is all about .
i 'm not sure if you can stipulate experience in job adverts anymore .
we will have to sit down with our hr advisors to sort this out .
we do most of our recruiting through an agency so they keep on top of this sort of thing .
i think the legislation is probably a good thing for companies that have been a bit unscrupulous about the type of people they might employ , but for us it 's just another level of bureaucracy we have to follow .
i think there has been a bit of a stigma in the past about people near the retirement age but i think the new law is a positive thing .
we would welcome people to stay with us for longer .
pauline redpath runs her own recruitment firm source people in scotland .
pauline 's company specialises in recruiting legal , accountancy , hr and technical engineering staff for its clients , mainly in the oil industry .
it now employs 12 staff after starting up just two years ago .
we run a lot of the advertising for our clients and plenty has to change , such as using age in any form of advert , for instance asking for an office junior .
or saying that someone over the age of 25 is unlikely to have the necessary experience , unless there is a genuine occupational requirement .
employers can still discriminate if they can show that being a certain age is a genuine occupational requirement ageist recruitment ads must come to an end most clients accept this is the way things are going and just ask how they can best get on with it .
they are most worried about their advertising and being caught out and tripped up by the new legislation .
once they get used to it they will be more comfortable .
some companies have chosen to remove the date of birth section from their application forms , though you do n't in fact have to do that .
tony newton is managing director of biotrace ltd in bridgend .
tony 's firm makes equipment for food manufacturers to measure cleanliness and employs 110 staff .
it 's a very good idea , particularly with the demise of pensions in the uk .
there are many people now who are facing the prospect of working far longer than they would otherwise have chosen to .
anything that encourages employers to operate more fairly with regard to older , more experienced people is a good move .
i do n't think it will make a difference to us as we are a very progressive employer in that respect .
we have a critical mass which means we can employ a specialist to deal with this .
there are many smaller companies that ca n't afford to do that .

rob petersen owns an advertising , marketing and pr company .
rob employs four full-time and two part-time staff in cardiff since starting up two years ago .
my profession has a reputation for only employing younger people .
but the days of retiring on a specific date because you are on the scrap heap have gone .
recruitment is going to be a potential problem area because some jobs suit younger people , so the wording of adverts in the future will have to be more careful .
from my point of view , there are a lot of people with a huge amount of experience who are older and who it would be a shame to discriminate against because of their age .
they are more worldly-wise and can deal with people better and that 's a huge advantage i think .
there should quite rightly be a tightening up of the law .
i think it 's very important legislation .
andy hayes , managing director of north offshore in aberdeen .
andy 's company employs 100 staff refurbishing shops , hotels , offices and accommodation on oil rigs .
we are very much aware of it and i do n't think it is going to affect us to any great degree .
a bit more paperwork wo n't make much of a burden .
we have such difficulty finding staff that the legislation wo n't make much difference .
i am very happy taking on people at a senior age because of the wealth of experience they have .
anyone who is good enough , we are desperate to have them .
formally our retirement age is 65 but if someone comes along and says they want to work on and we recognise them as a valued member of our team , we will allow them to do it .
i do n't have the luxury of shoving older workers out of the door .
mike bain runs escape business technologies in aberdeen .
mike 's it and telecoms consultancy has been going for seven years and employs 26 staff .
i do n't think there 's been a clear message about what the legislation is all about .
i 'm not sure if you can stipulate experience in job adverts anymore .
we will have to sit down with our hr advisors to sort this out .
we do most of our recruiting through an agency so they keep on top of this sort of thing .
i think the legislation is probably a good thing for companies that have been a bit unscrupulous about the type of people they might employ , but for us it 's just another level of bureaucracy we have to follow .
i think there has been a bit of a stigma in the past about people near the retirement age but i think the new law is a positive thing .
we would welcome people to stay with us for longer .
pauline redpath runs her own recruitment firm source people in scotland .
pauline 's company specialises in recruiting legal , accountancy , hr and technical engineering staff for its clients , mainly in the oil industry .
it now employs 12 staff after starting up just two years ago .
we run a lot of the advertising for our clients and plenty has to change , such as using age in any form of advert , for instance asking for an office junior .
or saying that someone over the age of 25 is unlikely to have the necessary experience , unless there is a genuine occupational requirement .
employers can still discriminate if they can show that being a certain age is a genuine occupational requirement ageist recruitment ads must come to an end most clients accept this is the way things are going and just ask how they can best get on with it .
they are most worried about their advertising and being caught out and tripped up by the new legislation .
once they get used to it they will be more comfortable .
some companies have chosen to remove the date of birth section from their application forms , though you do n't in fact have to do that .
tony newton is managing director of biotrace ltd in bridgend .
tony 's firm makes equipment for food manufacturers to measure cleanliness and employs 110 staff .
it 's a very good idea , particularly with the demise of pensions in the uk .
there are many people now who are facing the prospect of working far longer than they would otherwise have chosen to .
anything that encourages employers to operate more fairly with regard to older , more experienced people is a good move .
i do n't think it will make a difference to us as we are a very progressive employer in that respect .
we have a critical mass which means we can employ a specialist to deal with this .
there are many smaller companies that ca n't afford to do that .

both the british medical association and royal college of physicians said changes were needed .
but bma chairman james johnson added they could lead to the small hospitals left behind being " whittled away " .
mr nicholson , who took up the health service reins at the beginning of september , said " tough decisions " needed to be taken . "
to suggest that this is all part of some rational planning process is nonsense " geoff martin , of health emergency he said the changes could affect every region , and may lead to emergency , maternity and paediatric care being centralised in fewer hospitals .
he said the moves were needed to balance the books , but added it was also about improving services by providing the best care in fewer centres , although he acknowledged this would mean patients travelling further for treatment .
but mr johnson said : " many people including doctors and nurses are fearful if you take a & e away from hospitals other services will be whittled away and eventually closed .

" all this makes change inevitable .
there is no point burying our heads in the sand . "
ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians , agreed care must be taken to ensure services left behind met patient needed .
but he added : " leaving aside financial cutbacks , the pressure on medical staff due to reducing junior doctors ' hours to comply with the european working time directive has made it increasingly difficult to maintain full emergency services running 24 hours a day in many hospitals . "

geoff martin , of the health emergency campaign group , said : " to suggest that this is all part of some rational planning process is nonsense .

a department of health spokeswoman said while the nhs was changing it did not mean " wholesale closures of district general hospitals " .

in his first interview last week , nhs boss david nicholson said emergency services may be centralised in super hospitals under plans being drawn up .
both the british medical association and royal college of physicians said changes were needed .
but bma chairman james johnson added they could lead to the small hospitals left behind being " whittled away " .
mr nicholson , who took up the health service reins at the beginning of september , said " tough decisions " needed to be taken .
to suggest that this is all part of some rational planning process is nonsense geoff martin , of health emergency he said the changes could affect every region , and may lead to emergency , maternity and paediatric care being centralised in fewer hospitals .
he said the moves were needed to balance the books , but added it was also about improving services by providing the best care in fewer centres , although he acknowledged this would mean patients travelling further for treatment .

" small hospitals must remain and have a range of services such as minor injury units , gp walk-in centres , planned surgery and intermediate care beds . "

" all this makes change inevitable .
there is no point burying our heads in the sand . "
ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians , agreed care must be taken to ensure services left behind met patient needed .
but he added : " leaving aside financial cutbacks , the pressure on medical staff due to reducing junior doctors ' hours to comply with the european working time directive has made it increasingly difficult to maintain full emergency services running 24 hours a day in many hospitals . "
however , campaigners maintained the hospital reconfigurations , some of which have already started , were being driven by cost .
geoff martin , of the health emergency campaign group , said : " to suggest that this is all part of some rational planning process is nonsense .
" what we are looking at is a cash-driven avalanche of panic cuts and closures which will have deadly impact on patient care . "
a department of health spokeswoman said while the nhs was changing it did not mean " wholesale closures of district general hospitals " .
and she added : " reconfigurations are locally-led solutions to address local issues and we would stress that any decision on significant changes to services will only be made after full public consultation with local people . "

child seats or booster cushions are now compulsory for under-12s under 135cm -lrb- 4ft 5in -rrb- tall , but consumer group which ? says many parents are not ready .
drivers face fines from £ 30 on-the-spot or up to £ 500 in court if they do not ensure that the children they are carrying comply with the regulations .
in northern ireland , the new rules are set to come in by the end of the year .
retailers have reported soaring sales of child seats , and but supermarket chain asda has urged ministers to drop vat on the seats as they are now compulsory .

pat harris , director of the transport pressure group , belt up school kids , said : " not only is it a short run-up to the actual law changing but also the way it is worded is very confusing for parents .
" not just parents , but head teachers of schools , also some county councils who are unsure how to apply the new legislation . "

it is also unclear how stringently different police forces will implement the new law from the outset .
the association of chief police officers in scotland said enforcement would be governed by " common sense " but urged drivers to be aware of the law .
and superintendent phil davies of south wales police said : " we will be targeting schools and shopping areas to educate members of the public about the new legislation . "
the onus will be on drivers to ensure they have the correct seats and that they are used .

safety groups have welcomed the new regime , which the government says will prevent 2,000 child injuries every year .
duncan vernon from the royal society for the prevention of accidents said the fines were to " reinforce the fact that children do need a suitable restraint in order to carry them safely " .
exemptions do apply , such as if the car is not big enough to accommodate three seats across the back , then two will be sufficient .
and children who are on a short and occasional journey made for reasons of " unexpected necessity " - such as giving a youngster from another family a lift home - will be exempted from having the necessary restraint .
but several police forces have pointed out this will not cover arrangements between some families to ferry each other 's children on the daily school run .

the 23-year-old from pembrokeshire said she felt she had " woken up on another planet " after her victory in bbc one 's how do you solve a problem like maria ?
she will begin rehearsals in a week for andrew lloyd webber 's production .
as celebrations continued back home in and around haverfordwest , her mother jan said : " she 's got what it takes " .
an average 7.7m viewers watched the result on saturday night , and most of the 2m who voted backed connie against helena blackman , also 23 , from southampton .
just before the result was announced lloyd webber revealed that connie was his choice to play the nun who becomes governess to the unruly von trapp children , played by julie andrews in the 1965 film . "
we drove past a billboard this morning ... my life has gone mad " connie fisher , celebrating with andrew lloyd webber connie told bbc radio wales : " i can not believe it .
it 's like i 've woken up on a different planet .
" helena put up such a fight , did n't she ?
she 's come from strength to strength and i thought there was no way in a million years i was going to win it .
" i always hoped that people would see maria in me , because i 've always been told , ' you 're such a maria ' .
" some people have told me , ' if there is one role for you it is maria von trapp , ' so here i am .
' rejection after rejection ' " i 've grown up with it .
my favourite musical films when i was younger were the sound of music and mary poppins .
i was a big julie andrews fan and there 's always been a bit of julie in me . "
a welsh-speaker , her first acting experience was in the youth section of the torch theatre at milford haven , and she sang at school and in the eisteddfod .
she graduated with first class honours from the mountview academy of theatre arts in wood green , london .
but she spent 18 months auditioning for roles with no success while working in a call centre . "
you can have what it takes , but it 's what you do with it " connie 's mother , jan fisher she will now take on the huge role only months after landing her first professional job in the torch theatre 's version of aladdin last christmas .
" after a year-and-a-half of rejection after rejection in auditions i thought it 's been leading up to something , " she said .
she referred to martine mccutcheon 's unhappy experience five years ago in the west end version of my fair lady , when the former eastenders star quit after eight months because of health problems .
" i promise the public when they come to see me they will not have a martine mccutcheon .
i will be as solid as a rock and i will not let them down . "
' proud of my roots ' rehearsals for he musical which opens at the london palladium on 14 november begin in a week .
connie told bbc breakfast the reality of what has happened to her was only just sinking in .
" we drove past a billboard this morning .
it was like ' i 'm on a billboard ' .
my life has gone mad .
i 'm loving it . "
connie will perform probably six performances of the sound of the music with another singer / actress taking on the role for the remaining two shows .
the show 's producers andrew lloyd webber and david ian have both defended the practice of a " substitute " singer as a normal practice in musical theatre .
connie said it was perfectly normal to have an alternate performer and stressed she was looking on this as her big chance .
she said : " i want a career in musical theatre not just five minutes of fame .
" i really want it to be a success and i 'm going to give it my all . "
her mother , jan fisher , 58 and grandmother dorothy pare , 83 , were in the audience to see her triumph .
mrs fisher said she was dumbstruck but always felt her daughter would make it .
" at the bottom of our hearts we knew , " she said .
while connie is poised for fame and fortune , her mother and grandmother are also finding themselves in the spotlight .
they returned to their central london hotel in the early hours of sunday to find the manager had sent up a bottle of champagne .
as connie 's mother and grandmother prepared to head home to pembrokeshire for the celebrations , mrs fisher said : " there 's going to be a few bottles of champagne around .
" i 'm just really proud of my daughter who has worked so hard for what she 's got .
" i just know she wo n't let you down .
she 's worked so hard for this .

the animal , called tai , was covered in pink and gold paint and placed in a mocked-up house to represent how world poverty is widely ignored .
officials from the los angeles animal services department told the associated press they would never again issue permits for such a " frivolous " purpose .
the elephant 's owner said the dye was non-toxic and welfare was paramount .
ed boks , head of animal services in los angeles , said : " i think it sends a very wrong message that abusing animals is not only ok , it 's an art form .
" we find it no longer acceptable to dye baby chicks at easter , but it 's ok to dye an elephant . "
secret identity mr boks said he tried to withdraw permits for the elephant on grounds of public safety last friday , but found the three-day exhibition would be over before they took effect .
" permits will not be issued for such frivolous abuse of animals in the future , " he said .
tai 's owner , kari johnson , denied that the 38-year-old indian elephant had suffered as a result of the paint job .
she said : " tai has done many , many movies .
she 's used to make-up . "
the british graffiti artist 's barely legal exhibition , which took place in a warehouse in downtown los angeles , finished on sunday .
the artist was not available to discuss the california show , which focused on global poverty and injustice .

the poll of 526 families found 39 % had had a child excluded from class , and in 11 % of cases this was permanent .
almost two thirds said their child 's ability to achieve at school was " very affected " by their condition .
the government said exclusion rates for children with special needs had decreased in the past three years .
addiss - the attention deficit disorder information and support service - carried out the survey of 526 families as part of the first national adhd awareness week .
lack of resources the charity said the survey highlighted a lack of resources and support available for children with adhd and their families .
more than two thirds of parents questioned did not have access to a local adhd clinic , nurse or advisory teacher .
parents said the disorder affected the rest of the family , with the associated behaviours - extreme difficulty sitting still or concentrating - making normal family life difficult .
many parents said they had had marital problems .
over half of parents surveyed said it had an impact on the family 's ability to go on holiday , 76 % said it hindered their ability to visit friends and 82 % said it affected their ability to go shopping .
and 80 % felt their child with adhd had low self-esteem compared with other children .
intervention the survey also found many parents felt the benefit of early diagnosis .
of those questioned , 80 % felt their child 's relationships with other children has improved as a result of receiving treatment , be it medical or non-medical .
and 89 % felt their child 's performance at school had improved as a result of receiving treatment and 84 % that their child 's relationship with their teacher had improved .
" early identification of adhd is key , " said andrea bilbow , founder of addiss .
" with the right help from schools and access to appropriate medical and non-medical treatment , we can support children with adhd through their developing years and help them succeed in life . "
strategies the department for education and skills said it was tackling disproportionate exclusions for pupils with special needs .
a spokesman said : " we fully back head teachers that take tough action to tackle misbehaviour and disruption in the classroom , permanently excluding pupils where their behaviour warrants it .
" equally , we need to ensure that this power is not used disproportionately with regard to any particular group .
" that is why we have strategies in place to support schools with sen pupils and tackle disproportionate exclusions , and the rate of exclusion for pupils with statements of sen has decreased in each of the last three years - including by 8 percentage points in just the last year . "

many parents said they had had marital problems .
over half of parents surveyed said it had an impact on the family 's ability to go on holiday , 76 % said it hindered their ability to visit friends and 82 % said it affected their ability to go shopping .
and 80 % felt their child with adhd had low self-esteem compared with other children .
intervention the survey also found many parents felt the benefit of early diagnosis .
of those questioned , 80 % felt their child 's relationships with other children has improved as a result of receiving treatment , be it medical or non-medical .
and 89 % felt their child 's performance at school had improved as a result of receiving treatment and 84 % that their child 's relationship with their teacher had improved .
" early identification of adhd is key , " said andrea bilbow , founder of addiss .
" with the right help from schools and access to appropriate medical and non-medical treatment , we can support children with adhd through their developing years and help them succeed in life . "
strategies the department for education and skills said it was tackling disproportionate exclusions for pupils with special needs .
a spokesman said : " we fully back head teachers that take tough action to tackle misbehaviour and disruption in the classroom , permanently excluding pupils where their behaviour warrants it .
" equally , we need to ensure that this power is not used disproportionately with regard to any particular group .
" that is why we have strategies in place to support schools with sen pupils and tackle disproportionate exclusions , and the rate of exclusion for pupils with statements of sen has decreased in each of the last three years - including by 8 percentage points in just the last year . "

by ian pollock personal finance reporter , bbc news when the new law against age discrimination comes into effect on 1 october it could bring a dramatic opportunity for millions of workers .
those whose employers stipulate a retirement age of 60 will now find they can work on until at least 65 .
if their employer does not like that idea they will have to come up with a very good reason - not related to age - to justify the enforced retirement .
the government hopes that people will take advantage of the new law to work for a few more years and help ease the burden on their pension schemes .
good for your health ?
financially , those who work past their former retirement age should be better off . "
for many it will be positively beneficial " prof tom kirkwood send us your experiences quick guide : age discrimination they will earn for longer and if they defer their pension , it will be larger when they do eventually draw it .
but not so long ago the idea that working longer might also be good for your health would not have had much support .
trade unions campaigned for decades for workers to retire at 60 - and work fewer hours each week as well - precisely to avoid their members retiring and then dropping dead soon after , worn out from a life of toil .
it still happens , but modern medical opinion now seems to be that a few extra years of work in your early 60s will not harm most people and could in fact be beneficial .
professor tom kirkwood is director of the institute for ageing and health at newcastle university .
" most have nothing to fear , " he says .
" for many it will be positively beneficial - provided the jobs are not damaging and provide some challenge and satisfaction . "
he argues that work provides meaning and purpose for many people and that ending it suddenly through complete retirement can be quite damaging and stressful .
ageing well , he says , involves retaining a positive attitude towards ones future , and having a job you are at least content to continue with is part of that .
heavy work of course for some , retiring as early as possible is a blessing , either because their ability to do a job is impaired by illness , or because the job itself is physically demanding or stressful .
professor chris drinkwater is a spokesman for the royal college of gps .
he points out that mental and physical fitness does deteriorate with age , albeit at widely varying rates .
so those who do heavy physical jobs , firefighters for instance , might not thrive on more work .
nor would those who depend on mental agility and a high level of eye and hand coordination , such as aeroplane pilots .
but professor drinkwater agrees that if people work voluntarily for a few more years it will probably be good for their health .
" it keeps both your body and brain engaged and that does have health benefits , " he says .
the social benefit of working is important too .
" the evidence is that people with good social networks do better . "
increased longevity so if many are , on the whole , going to be healthier for working a longer , will that have any effect on life expectancy ? "
we ca n't use age as a measure of how fit and active people are - there is a huge variation " richard jones , iosh strangely enough , no one seems to have asked the question .
the office for national statistics , which works out the official population and mortality projections for the government , has not been asked .
neither has the government actuaries department , nor the institute of actuaries .
but perhaps the government does not need to worry about the life expectancy issue .
one reason it wants us to work longer is precisely because we are , on average , continuing to live longer anyway .
people are now much healthier in their early 60s than they were a few decades ago , as shown by the sharp fall in the mortality rates at that age .
figures published by the actuarial profession last year , based on the most recent analysis of data from life insurance companies , showed that the death rate for people in their late 60s had dropped by around 30 % since 1994 .
meanwhile the government 's own life expectancy figures show that back in 1981 a man aged 65 could expect to live , on average , for another 13 years .
but by 2004 that had risen by nearly four more years to 16.7 years .
could that be extended even further if our working lives are prolonged too ?
dave grimshaw , who runs the institute of actuaries ' research into longevity -lrb- known as the continuous mortality investigation -rrb- reckons nothing dramatic will be visible .
" the impact is likely to be very gradual over time , " he says .
accidents some suspect that people who work beyond the age of 60 may be at a greater risk of having an accident .
but existing statistics compiled by the health and safety executive paint a mixed picture .

by ian pollock personal finance reporter , bbc news he ca n't get no satisfaction , but is still working in his sixties when the new law against age discrimination comes into effect on 1 october it could bring a dramatic opportunity for millions of workers .
those whose employers stipulate a retirement age of 60 will now find they can work on until at least 65 .
if their employer does not like that idea they will have to come up with a very good reason - not related to age - to justify the enforced retirement .
the government hopes that people will take advantage of the new law to work for a few more years and help ease the burden on their pension schemes .
good for your health ?
financially , those who work past their former retirement age should be better off .
for many it will be positively beneficial prof tom kirkwood send us your experiences quick guide : age discrimination they will earn for longer and if they defer their pension , it will be larger when they do eventually draw it .
but not so long ago the idea that working longer might also be good for your health would not have had much support .
trade unions campaigned for decades for workers to retire at 60 - and work fewer hours each week as well - precisely to avoid their members retiring and then dropping dead soon after , worn out from a life of toil .
it still happens , but modern medical opinion now seems to be that a few extra years of work in your early 60s will not harm most people and could in fact be beneficial .
professor tom kirkwood is director of the institute for ageing and health at newcastle university .
" most have nothing to fear , " he says .
" for many it will be positively beneficial - provided the jobs are not damaging and provide some challenge and satisfaction . "
he argues that work provides meaning and purpose for many people and that ending it suddenly through complete retirement can be quite damaging and stressful .
ageing well , he says , involves retaining a positive attitude towards ones future , and having a job you are at least content to continue with is part of that .
heavy work of course for some , retiring as early as possible is a blessing , either because their ability to do a job is impaired by illness , or because the job itself is physically demanding or stressful .
more work for the over 60s may come as a surprise for some professor chris drinkwater is a spokesman for the royal college of gps .
he points out that mental and physical fitness does deteriorate with age , albeit at widely varying rates .
so those who do heavy physical jobs , firefighters for instance , might not thrive on more work .
nor would those who depend on mental agility and a high level of eye and hand coordination , such as aeroplane pilots .
but professor drinkwater agrees that if people work voluntarily for a few more years it will probably be good for their health .
" it keeps both your body and brain engaged and that does have health benefits , " he says .
the social benefit of working is important too .
" the evidence is that people with good social networks do better . "
increased longevity so if many are , on the whole , going to be healthier for working a longer , will that have any effect on life expectancy ?
we ca n't use age as a measure of how fit and active people are - there is a huge variation richard jones , iosh strangely enough , no one seems to have asked the question .
the office for national statistics , which works out the official population and mortality projections for the government , has not been asked .
neither has the government actuaries department , nor the institute of actuaries .
but perhaps the government does not need to worry about the life expectancy issue .
one reason it wants us to work longer is precisely because we are , on average , continuing to live longer anyway .
people are now much healthier in their early 60s than they were a few decades ago , as shown by the sharp fall in the mortality rates at that age .
figures published by the actuarial profession last year , based on the most recent analysis of data from life insurance companies , showed that the death rate for people in their late 60s had dropped by around 30 % since 1994 .
meanwhile the government 's own life expectancy figures show that back in 1981 a man aged 65 could expect to live , on average , for another 13 years .
but by 2004 that had risen by nearly four more years to 16.7 years .
could that be extended even further if our working lives are prolonged too ?
dave grimshaw , who runs the institute of actuaries ' research into longevity -lrb- known as the continuous mortality investigation -rrb- reckons nothing dramatic will be visible .
" the impact is likely to be very gradual over time , " he says .
accidents some suspect that people who work beyond the age of 60 may be at a greater risk of having an accident .

by ian pollock personal finance reporter , bbc news he ca n't get no satisfaction , but is still working in his sixties when the new law against age discrimination comes into effect on 1 october it could bring a dramatic opportunity for millions of workers .
those whose employers stipulate a retirement age of 60 will now find they can work on until at least 65 .
if their employer does not like that idea they will have to come up with a very good reason - not related to age - to justify the enforced retirement .
the government hopes that people will take advantage of the new law to work for a few more years and help ease the burden on their pension schemes .
good for your health ?
financially , those who work past their former retirement age should be better off .
for many it will be positively beneficial prof tom kirkwood send us your experiences quick guide : age discrimination they will earn for longer and if they defer their pension , it will be larger when they do eventually draw it .
but not so long ago the idea that working longer might also be good for your health would not have had much support .
trade unions campaigned for decades for workers to retire at 60 - and work fewer hours each week as well - precisely to avoid their members retiring and then dropping dead soon after , worn out from a life of toil .
it still happens , but modern medical opinion now seems to be that a few extra years of work in your early 60s will not harm most people and could in fact be beneficial .
professor tom kirkwood is director of the institute for ageing and health at newcastle university .
" most have nothing to fear , " he says .
" for many it will be positively beneficial - provided the jobs are not damaging and provide some challenge and satisfaction . "
he argues that work provides meaning and purpose for many people and that ending it suddenly through complete retirement can be quite damaging and stressful .
ageing well , he says , involves retaining a positive attitude towards ones future , and having a job you are at least content to continue with is part of that .
heavy work of course for some , retiring as early as possible is a blessing , either because their ability to do a job is impaired by illness , or because the job itself is physically demanding or stressful .
more work for the over 60s may come as a surprise for some professor chris drinkwater is a spokesman for the royal college of gps .
he points out that mental and physical fitness does deteriorate with age , albeit at widely varying rates .
so those who do heavy physical jobs , firefighters for instance , might not thrive on more work .
nor would those who depend on mental agility and a high level of eye and hand coordination , such as aeroplane pilots .
but professor drinkwater agrees that if people work voluntarily for a few more years it will probably be good for their health .
" it keeps both your body and brain engaged and that does have health benefits , " he says .
the social benefit of working is important too .
" the evidence is that people with good social networks do better . "
increased longevity so if many are , on the whole , going to be healthier for working a longer , will that have any effect on life expectancy ?
we ca n't use age as a measure of how fit and active people are - there is a huge variation richard jones , iosh strangely enough , no one seems to have asked the question .
the office for national statistics , which works out the official population and mortality projections for the government , has not been asked .
neither has the government actuaries department , nor the institute of actuaries .
but perhaps the government does not need to worry about the life expectancy issue .
one reason it wants us to work longer is precisely because we are , on average , continuing to live longer anyway .
people are now much healthier in their early 60s than they were a few decades ago , as shown by the sharp fall in the mortality rates at that age .
figures published by the actuarial profession last year , based on the most recent analysis of data from life insurance companies , showed that the death rate for people in their late 60s had dropped by around 30 % since 1994 .
meanwhile the government 's own life expectancy figures show that back in 1981 a man aged 65 could expect to live , on average , for another 13 years .
but by 2004 that had risen by nearly four more years to 16.7 years .
could that be extended even further if our working lives are prolonged too ?
dave grimshaw , who runs the institute of actuaries ' research into longevity -lrb- known as the continuous mortality investigation -rrb- reckons nothing dramatic will be visible .
" the impact is likely to be very gradual over time , " he says .
accidents some suspect that people who work beyond the age of 60 may be at a greater risk of having an accident .
but existing statistics compiled by the health and safety executive paint a mixed picture .
for men , the rate of non-fatal injuries at work peaks in their late 30s and early 40s and then declines steadily .
however , the rate bumps up by 5 % for those aged 60 to 64 , compared with those between 55 and 59 , before falling again very sharply after 65 .
even so , the age 60-64 accident rate is still 12 % lower than the rate for all age groups .
for women the accident rate , which is generally much lower than for men , hits a gentle peak in their late 50s before falling away .
like their medical counterparts , health and safety advisors believe that most people have nothing to fear from working for a few more years in their early 60s .
" this legislation will not affect many people in a detrimental way , " says richard jones , of the institution of occupational safety & health -lrb- iosh -rrb- .
" it gives people choice where in the past employers might have put an artificial cap on working . "
" wear and tear sets in , " he says .
" but we ca n't use age as a measure of how fit and active people are - there is a huge variation . "

the new tax system , called a " reverse charge " , means that for certain electronic goods only the final retailer will be able to levy vat .
it aims to stop criminals stealing vat charged on goods imported free of the tax from elsewhere in the eu .
the fraud is estimated to have cost the government £ 8.5bn since 2001 .
in 2004/05 , the hmrc estimated it lost between £ 1.2bn- £ 1.9bn , and the losses for the 2005/06 tax year are expected to be much higher .
the scam has been dubbed " carousel fraud " because the goods , particularly mobile phones , are often exported and then re-imported in a series of contrived transactions .
if this happens then hmrc repays vat to the criminals when the goods are exported to another eu country , but suffers huge losses as the vat was never collected when the items were imported in the first place .
accounting headache the deadline of 1 december for the introduction of the new vat system depends on final authorisation from the eu commission , something the uk government has been seeking since the start of the year .
goods covered by the reverse charge mobile phones computer chips hard discs , usb drives etc mp3 players pdas gps systems blackberries games consoles but hmrc admits the new system will be a big headache for the legitimate vat-registered importers and sellers of the goods .
" implementation of the reverse charge requires fundamental changes to the accounting systems of businesses trading in the relevant goods , " it said .
although it is briefing the software industry on the necessary changes , hmrc acknowledges that making the changes in time will be a " challenging timeframe " .
as a result , much software will not be ready until early next year and many businesses will , at first , have to carry out the new accounting by hand , which could be complicated .
european campaign this forthcoming change is just one part of hmrc 's plan to attack carousel fraud , which is regarded as the single biggest threat to the tax system throughout europe .
last month , international co-operation led to uk and german tax officials seizing more than 30,000 mobile phones at frankfurt airport and on the german-swiss border .
in the uk , hmrc has established a database called nemesis to register all imported and exported mobile phones so the authorities can tell if they are being regularly imported and exported on a " carousel " .
in addition , more than a thousand hmrc staff have been deployed to scrutinise attempts by businesses to register for vat and to check their claims for vat refunds .

the fraud is estimated to have cost the government £ 8.5bn since 2001 .
in 2004/05 , the hmrc estimated it lost between £ 1.2bn- £ 1.9bn , and the losses for the 2005/06 tax year are expected to be much higher .
the scam has been dubbed " carousel fraud " because the goods , particularly mobile phones , are often exported and then re-imported in a series of contrived transactions .
if this happens then hmrc repays vat to the criminals when the goods are exported to another eu country , but suffers huge losses as the vat was never collected when the items were imported in the first place .
accounting headache the deadline of 1 december for the introduction of the new vat system depends on final authorisation from the eu commission , something the uk government has been seeking since the start of the year .
goods covered by the reverse charge mobile phones computer chips hard discs , usb drives etc mp3 players pdas gps systems blackberries games consoles but hmrc admits the new system will be a big headache for the legitimate vat-registered importers and sellers of the goods .
" implementation of the reverse charge requires fundamental changes to the accounting systems of businesses trading in the relevant goods , " it said .
although it is briefing the software industry on the necessary changes , hmrc acknowledges that making the changes in time will be a " challenging timeframe " .
as a result , much software will not be ready until early next year and many businesses will , at first , have to carry out the new accounting by hand , which could be complicated .
european campaign this forthcoming change is just one part of hmrc 's plan to attack carousel fraud , which is regarded as the single biggest threat to the tax system throughout europe .
last month , international co-operation led to uk and german tax officials seizing more than 30,000 mobile phones at frankfurt airport and on the german-swiss border .
in the uk , hmrc has established a database called nemesis to register all imported and exported mobile phones so the authorities can tell if they are being regularly imported and exported on a " carousel " .
in addition , more than a thousand hmrc staff have been deployed to scrutinise attempts by businesses to register for vat and to check their claims for vat refunds .
