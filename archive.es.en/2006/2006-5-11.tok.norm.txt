program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2006 german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel defended the bnd 's role on its 50th anniversary while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .
chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .
spy chief ernst uhrlau told reporters at the anniversary event that the investigation had placed his agency in a " very difficult situation . " spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .
" we believe the government has nothing worthy of criticism that it needs to keep secret . " opposition parliamentarians are prepared to go to court if necessary to have key papers released and secret documents disclosed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight a selection of dw-world articles looking at the bnd affair and the role of germany 's secret service .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2006 german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel defended the bnd 's role on its 50th anniversary while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .
chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .
spy chief ernst uhrlau told reporters at the anniversary event that the investigation had placed his agency in a " very difficult situation . " spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .
" we believe the government has nothing worthy of criticism that it needs to keep secret . " opposition parliamentarians are prepared to go to court if necessary to have key papers released and secret documents disclosed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight a selection of dw-world articles looking at the bnd affair and the role of germany 's secret service .
german politicians to face grilling as bnd inquiry begins a german parliamentary committee began work friday on a full probe into the role of german spies in the iraq war and the country 's alleged involvement in the cia rendition of terror suspects .

but it ’ s not been all smooth sailing for the group . metro 's vast cash-and-carry store in india 's it capital bangalore with its trademark blue and yellow logo looks like any other in europe .
the shelves are full of off-the-peg clothes , household goods and frozen seafood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash-and-carry center in bangalore offers off-the-peg clothes but in a country where more than 70 percent of the people are vegetarians , metro 's assortment suffers from a glaring lack of fresh fruit and vegetables . the puzzling exception is explained by legislation in a few indian states which prevents farmers from selling their wares directly to retailers .
in the state of karnataka too , of which bangalore is the capital , most farm produce must be bought and sold at government-run markets through a complicated system of middlemen and farmers . local resentment the result is not just a crippling financial disadvantage for metro - fruits and vegetables account for about 30 percent of trade turnover in india - but also a lobby of local traders resentful of the foreign wholesaler . " yes , i 've heard of metro , " said nagesh kumaran , a 36-year-old farmer selling tomatoes and fresh red chilies piled high on the grimy grounds of a chaotic fruit and vegetable wholesale market a few kilometers away from the sanitized environment of metro .
" all they want to do is to ruin us financially . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local farmers and traders in bangalore are n't thrilled about metro 's arrival metro , which buys 98 percent of its stock in bangalore locally , denies this , arguing that it would offer farmers better margins by using modern methods of transportation and distribution . " about 35-40 percent of fruits and vegetables rot in transit in india due to transport delays and inadequate cold storage .
that also means lost money for farmers , " said harsh bahadur , ceo of metro india . he remembers the traders even going on a week-long protest when the metro group , one of the first foreign players to enter the indian wholesale market with two cash-and-carry centers in bangalore , first arrived in 2003 . " with 600 traders on strike for six days , there was no rice available in bangalore .
that 's the kind of pressure the government is under when it comes to letting in a foreign company . " door to indian market still closed , for now the dilemma is also representative of the bewildering minefield of central , state and local regulations that foreign investors eyeing india 's booming economy and its fast-growing middle class have to deal with . the country 's retail sector in particular is governed by rules that still bar foreign direct investment .
with more than 12 million small retailers in india and one in 25 families earning their livelihood in the sector , there are fears that an influx of foreign supermarket chains would drive millions out of business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath says trade barriers will be lowered slowly recently the indian government did allow foreign firms to hold up to a 51-percent stake in " single-brand " retail outlets .
but indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath has admitted the government is no hurry to relax barriers in the retail market . " we will open up one window after the after , " nath said .
" foreign investments in the retail sector must create jobs , not destroy them . " navigating the potholes metro 's bahadur says that metro has also had to navigate a confusing array of differing regional laws , tax rates and customs duties when it comes to transporting goods from one state to the other . the difficulty in buying land in india remains another huge deterrent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2006 merkel makes case for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to become more tangible to its citizens german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution . the eu 's greatest challenge is making it clear to ordinary citizens that they benefit from the bloc 's increased integration and expansion , merkel said in her first speech to parliament on european policy since she took power six months ago . " we have to realize that europe is not very popular among europeans , " she said in a speech to the german lower house of parliament . " we have to put citizens first . " to make the benefits of the eu clear , the german leader said europe needs to flex its economic muscles and prove it is capable of acting on the world stage . " europe has to show that it can mould world policy according to its own values , " merkel added . eu constitution and expansion need reexamination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch voted down the constitution last year merkel also said when germany takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in 2007 it would work to promote the european constitution despite its rejection by french and dutch voters last year .
the failure of national referendums in france and the netherlands threw the eu into one of its most difficult periods in its 50-year history . " we absolutely need the constitution to ensure the european union is effective and capable of action , " merkel said , but she also warned of moving too hastily .
" we must reflect how we can bring the constitution project to a successful conclusion . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , asked the 25-member union on wednesday not to make a final decision on the constitution until 2008 . merkel also addressed european expansion , another key issue that divides eu member states .
she said that bulgaria and romania - set to enter the bloc in 2007 or 2008 - would " clearly " become members .
but in an allusion to negotiations with turkey , she said expansion could not be a " one way street " and that the union needed alternatives to full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel discussed how the eu should open its doors to more countries " a body that does not have any borders can not act cohesively , " she said . before taking over as chancellor , merkel advocated a " privileged partnership " status for ankara and warned that full membership for the largely muslim country could prove too heavy a burden for the union . germany must meet euro criteria merkel defended economic measures germany has put in place to meet the european union 's stability and growth pact , which limits new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product .
germany plans to meet the rules in 2007 after breaching them for four years in a row . " it is not all right when we violate the stability pact for the third , fourth , fifth time because we do n't meet our own requirements , " merkel said . reaching europeans on an economic level is easiest when brussels works to revive the economy and lower unemployment , merkel said . " if we honestly answer these issues , then we will reach europeans and not just with words but with actions that follow the words , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso wants to delay decision on eu constitution european commission chief jose barroso urged eu leaders on wednesday to put off any decision on the bloc 's moribund constitution until at least 2008 .
-lrb- may 10 , 2006 -rrb- doubts about the future cloud europe day european union leaders marked europe day plagued by questions about where their 25-member club is headed after a series of stinging setbacks last year .

members of the german army 's special forces camped outside the troublesome city were so concerned that their camouflage uniforms may be used to identify them to taliban and al qaeda operatives that they organized for new and unidentifiable suits to be ordered from a german outdoor equipment store , again paying for the equipment with their own money . rumors that bundeswehr personnel were preparing to camp out all night outside branches of aldi in a bid to be the first to snap up the discount store 's new range of surface-to-air missiles were unsubstantiated at the time of publication . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grand coalition debates domestic use of bundeswehr the german government failed to agree on german military involvement in world cup security following a meeting monday .

" we have to realize that europe is not very popular among europeans , " she said in a speech to the german lower house of parliament . " we have to put citizens first . " to make the benefits of the eu clear , the german leader said europe needs to flex its economic muscles and prove it is capable of acting on the world stage . " europe has to show that it can mould world policy according to its own values , " merkel added . eu constitution and expansion need reexamination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch voted down the constitution last year merkel also said when germany takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in 2007 it would work to promote the european constitution despite its rejection by french and dutch voters last year .
the failure of national referendums in france and the netherlands threw the eu into one of its most difficult periods in its 50-year history . " we absolutely need the constitution to ensure the european union is effective and capable of action , " merkel said , but she also warned of moving too hastily .
" we must reflect how we can bring the constitution project to a successful conclusion . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , asked the 25-member union on wednesday not to make a final decision on the constitution until 2008 . merkel also addressed european expansion , another key issue that divides eu member states .
she said that bulgaria and romania - set to enter the bloc in 2007 or 2008 - would " clearly " become members .
but in an allusion to negotiations with turkey , she said expansion could not be a " one way street " and that the union needed alternatives to full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel discussed how the eu should open its doors to more countries " a body that does not have any borders can not act cohesively , " she said . before taking over as chancellor , merkel advocated a " privileged partnership " status for ankara and warned that full membership for the largely muslim country could prove too heavy a burden for the union . germany must meet euro criteria merkel defended economic measures germany has put in place to meet the european union 's stability and growth pact , which limits new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product .
germany plans to meet the rules in 2007 after breaching them for four years in a row . " it is not all right when we violate the stability pact for the third , fourth , fifth time because we do n't meet our own requirements , " merkel said . reaching europeans on an economic level is easiest when brussels works to revive the economy and lower unemployment , merkel said . " if we honestly answer these issues , then we will reach europeans and not just with words but with actions that follow the words , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso wants to delay decision on eu constitution european commission chief jose barroso urged eu leaders on wednesday to put off any decision on the bloc 's moribund constitution until at least 2008 .

" europe has to show that it can mould world policy according to its own values , " merkel added . eu constitution and expansion need reexamination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch voted down the constitution last year merkel also said when germany takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in 2007 it would work to promote the european constitution despite its rejection by french and dutch voters last year .
the failure of national referendums in france and the netherlands threw the eu into one of its most difficult periods in its 50-year history . " we absolutely need the constitution to ensure the european union is effective and capable of action , " merkel said , but she also warned of moving too hastily .
" we must reflect how we can bring the constitution project to a successful conclusion . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , asked the 25-member union on wednesday not to make a final decision on the constitution until 2008 . merkel also addressed european expansion , another key issue that divides eu member states .
she said that bulgaria and romania - set to enter the bloc in 2007 or 2008 - would " clearly " become members .
but in an allusion to negotiations with turkey , she said expansion could not be a " one way street " and that the union needed alternatives to full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel discussed how the eu should open its doors to more countries " a body that does not have any borders can not act cohesively , " she said . before taking over as chancellor , merkel advocated a " privileged partnership " status for ankara and warned that full membership for the largely muslim country could prove too heavy a burden for the union . germany must meet euro criteria merkel defended economic measures germany has put in place to meet the european union 's stability and growth pact , which limits new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product .
germany plans to meet the rules in 2007 after breaching them for four years in a row . " it is not all right when we violate the stability pact for the third , fourth , fifth time because we do n't meet our own requirements , " merkel said . reaching europeans on an economic level is easiest when brussels works to revive the economy and lower unemployment , merkel said . " if we honestly answer these issues , then we will reach europeans and not just with words but with actions that follow the words , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso wants to delay decision on eu constitution european commission chief jose barroso urged eu leaders on wednesday to put off any decision on the bloc 's moribund constitution until at least 2008 .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

but it ’ s not been all smooth sailing for the group . metro 's vast cash-and-carry store in india 's it capital bangalore with its trademark blue and yellow logo looks like any other in europe .
the shelves are full of off-the-peg clothes , household goods and frozen seafood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash-and-carry center in bangalore offers off-the-peg clothes but in a country where more than 70 percent of the people are vegetarians , metro 's assortment suffers from a glaring lack of fresh fruit and vegetables . the puzzling exception is explained by legislation in a few indian states which prevents farmers from selling their wares directly to retailers .
in the state of karnataka too , of which bangalore is the capital , most farm produce must be bought and sold at government-run markets through a complicated system of middlemen and farmers . local resentment the result is not just a crippling financial disadvantage for metro - fruits and vegetables account for about 30 percent of trade turnover in india - but also a lobby of local traders resentful of the foreign wholesaler . " yes , i 've heard of metro , " said nagesh kumaran , a 36-year-old farmer selling tomatoes and fresh red chilies piled high on the grimy grounds of a chaotic fruit and vegetable wholesale market a few kilometers away from the sanitized environment of metro .
" all they want to do is to ruin us financially . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local farmers and traders in bangalore are n't thrilled about metro 's arrival metro , which buys 98 percent of its stock in bangalore locally , denies this , arguing that it would offer farmers better margins by using modern methods of transportation and distribution . " about 35-40 percent of fruits and vegetables rot in transit in india due to transport delays and inadequate cold storage .
that also means lost money for farmers , " said harsh bahadur , ceo of metro india . he remembers the traders even going on a week-long protest when the metro group , one of the first foreign players to enter the indian wholesale market with two cash-and-carry centers in bangalore , first arrived in 2003 . " with 600 traders on strike for six days , there was no rice available in bangalore .
that 's the kind of pressure the government is under when it comes to letting in a foreign company . " door to indian market still closed , for now the dilemma is also representative of the bewildering minefield of central , state and local regulations that foreign investors eyeing india 's booming economy and its fast-growing middle class have to deal with . the country 's retail sector in particular is governed by rules that still bar foreign direct investment .
with more than 12 million small retailers in india and one in 25 families earning their livelihood in the sector , there are fears that an influx of foreign supermarket chains would drive millions out of business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath says trade barriers will be lowered slowly recently the indian government did allow foreign firms to hold up to a 51-percent stake in " single-brand " retail outlets .
but indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath has admitted the government is no hurry to relax barriers in the retail market . " we will open up one window after the after , " nath said .
" foreign investments in the retail sector must create jobs , not destroy them . " navigating the potholes metro 's bahadur says that metro has also had to navigate a confusing array of differing regional laws , tax rates and customs duties when it comes to transporting goods from one state to the other . the difficulty in buying land in india remains another huge deterrent .
" land titles are often not well-kept and disputed so there 's confusion about the real owner , " said bahadur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic snarls and congestion remain a huge problem in bangalore in addition , political instability in the state of karnataka has seen three governments come to power in the past three years , spelling doom for reforms and prompting metro to look at other indian states . worth all the trouble despite the stumbling blocks , metro insists its initial investments of 35 million euros in india thus far have been worth it .
it 's also announced plans to open three more cash-and-carry centers with investments totaling 300 million euros -lrb- $ 380 million -rrb- . given the sheer size and potential of the indian market , that 's hardly surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's surging domestic demand makes it attractive to foreign investors " let 's not forget that india has over 30 cities with more than one million inhabitants - we want a metro in every one of them , " said bahadur . a recent study by the a.t. kearney consultancy says india - with a trade volume of $ 330 billion and a yearly growth rate of 10 percent - is currently the most attractive place to invest for retail companies .
global players such as wal-mart are already knocking on the door , and even domestic giants such as reliance have plans to invest $ 2.2 billion in supermarkets . head start will pay off but metro says its head start has given it an edge .
bahadur points out that real estate prices have doubled in the time since metro set up shop and leased land in cities such as calcutta and hyderabad . " it 's true that you sometimes have to travel long thorny paths in india like metro not being allowed to sell all-important vegetables , grains and pulses , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of the metro group , at the recent hanover industrial fair . " but we 're confident that in the end our efforts will pay off .

the summit will focus on trade but is not expected to produce any major agreements . it is the fourth such meeting , with the last eu-latin america-caribbean summit coming two years ago in guadalajara , mexico .
some 60 heads of state and government , as well as un secretary general kofi annan , are expected to attend . latin america 's superstar , cuban leader fidel castro , is not coming but presidents luiz inacio lula da silva of brazil , argentina 's nestor kirchner , mexico 's vicente fox , and chile 's michelle bachelet will be there as well as leftist national leaders hugo chavez of venezuela and evo morales of boliva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivia caused a stir when it nationalized its oil industry morales has made headlines by nationalizing the oil industry in his country and chavez probes a strongly anti-american , anti-imperialist line , despite his country being one of the united states ' major oil suppliers . there may be more sympathy in europe than in washington for the populist aspirations of such latin american leaders . european commissioner for foreign affairs benita ferrero-waldner said in march that " inequalities clear the way for populists to present themselves as leaders at certain times . " people want equality , want to do away with poverty , " she said . human rights will be a key theme during the summit .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking for austria as current eu president and host of the gathering , has said that social cohesion and the fight against poverty must be encouraged . on thursday , foreign ministers will debate " strengthening the bi-regional strategic association , " plassnik said in a statement on the austrian presidency 's web site for the summit . she said europe and latin america are " partners " and have the same values . the two regions each have about half a billion inhabitants and have evolved towards democracy . trade ties the eu is overall the largest investor in latin america , the major aid donor and the region 's second-largest trading partner , after the united states . bilateral trade increased 13 percent in 2005 to reach 118 billion euros -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- , according to eu statistics . there will be a " business forum , " attended by over 200 entrepreneurs , bankers and politicians , during the summit . but political analyst ramon torrent said at a recent seminar in vienna that the summit would focus on " political declarations rather than practical results . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu regularly holds talks with the four-nation south american mercosur bloc eneko landabaru , chief of external affairs at the european commission wants to get talks started on a free-trade agreement for the eu with central america , even if no customs agreements have been agreed after seven years of talks with the south american mercosur common market of brazil , argentina , uruguay and paraguay . local interests in the caribbean as well as the threat of a break-up of the andean community of nations , from which venezuela has pulled out , are obstacles to regional integration in latin america . more widespread trade agreements with the eu depend on such integration . on the other hand , say analysts , political problems in the eu keep it from reaching out more to latin america , which remains a key sphere of influence of the united states . after rejecting a european constitution , " the eu has neither the political leadership nor the decision-making ability to make latin america a key part of its overall world strategy , " said argentinian political analyst raul bernal-meza . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .

the summit will focus on trade but is not expected to produce any major agreements . it is the fourth such meeting , with the last eu-latin america-caribbean summit coming two years ago in guadalajara , mexico .
some 60 heads of state and government , as well as un secretary general kofi annan , are expected to attend . latin america 's superstar , cuban leader fidel castro , is not coming but presidents luiz inacio lula da silva of brazil , argentina 's nestor kirchner , mexico 's vicente fox , and chile 's michelle bachelet will be there as well as leftist national leaders hugo chavez of venezuela and evo morales of boliva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivia caused a stir when it nationalized its oil industry morales has made headlines by nationalizing the oil industry in his country and chavez probes a strongly anti-american , anti-imperialist line , despite his country being one of the united states ' major oil suppliers . there may be more sympathy in europe than in washington for the populist aspirations of such latin american leaders . european commissioner for foreign affairs benita ferrero-waldner said in march that " inequalities clear the way for populists to present themselves as leaders at certain times . " people want equality , want to do away with poverty , " she said . human rights will be a key theme during the summit .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking for austria as current eu president and host of the gathering , has said that social cohesion and the fight against poverty must be encouraged . on thursday , foreign ministers will debate " strengthening the bi-regional strategic association , " plassnik said in a statement on the austrian presidency 's web site for the summit . she said europe and latin america are " partners " and have the same values . the two regions each have about half a billion inhabitants and have evolved towards democracy . trade ties the eu is overall the largest investor in latin america , the major aid donor and the region 's second-largest trading partner , after the united states . bilateral trade increased 13 percent in 2005 to reach 118 billion euros -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- , according to eu statistics . there will be a " business forum , " attended by over 200 entrepreneurs , bankers and politicians , during the summit . but political analyst ramon torrent said at a recent seminar in vienna that the summit would focus on " political declarations rather than practical results .

" we have to realize that europe is not very popular among europeans , " she said in a speech to the german lower house of parliament . " we have to put citizens first . " to make the benefits of the eu clear , the german leader said europe needs to flex its economic muscles and prove it is capable of acting on the world stage . " europe has to show that it can mould world policy according to its own values , " merkel added . eu constitution and expansion need reexamination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch voted down the constitution last year merkel also said when germany takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in 2007 it would work to promote the european constitution despite its rejection by french and dutch voters last year .
the failure of national referendums in france and the netherlands threw the eu into one of its most difficult periods in its 50-year history . " we absolutely need the constitution to ensure the european union is effective and capable of action , " merkel said , but she also warned of moving too hastily .
" we must reflect how we can bring the constitution project to a successful conclusion . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , asked the 25-member union on wednesday not to make a final decision on the constitution until 2008 . merkel also addressed european expansion , another key issue that divides eu member states .
she said that bulgaria and romania - set to enter the bloc in 2007 or 2008 - would " clearly " become members .
but in an allusion to negotiations with turkey , she said expansion could not be a " one way street " and that the union needed alternatives to full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel discussed how the eu should open its doors to more countries " a body that does not have any borders can not act cohesively , " she said . before taking over as chancellor , merkel advocated a " privileged partnership " status for ankara and warned that full membership for the largely muslim country could prove too heavy a burden for the union . germany must meet euro criteria merkel defended economic measures germany has put in place to meet the european union 's stability and growth pact , which limits new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product .

" in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement .

" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .

but then investors quickly offloaded the shares , which slumped to an intraday low of 11.74 euros . air berlin , the third-biggest low-cost airline in europe , had set the issue price at the lower end of the so-called " book building " range of 11.50-14.50 euros on wednesday , meaning it could raise up to 510 million euros from the initial public offering . the airline was originally scheduled to float on may 5 but concerns over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector forced the company to reassess its flotation and it was postponed until may 11 . it is thought that that fall-out from the postponement and the continued doubts over the airline 's future stability may have contributed to the rapid tail-off in trading over the day .
analysts also expressed their concerns that the company had decided to go public before it proved itself . i n vestors wary of u n prove n compa n y with big pla n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the low end share offer could n't attract more punters " it 's a bit of a disappointing start , particularly as the issue price was at the low end of the range proposed by the company , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with bankhaus metzler , said in an interview .
" and it 's still difficult for the shares to hold at that level , which does n't bode very well . " their track record is not great .
they have posted steady operating losses in the past three years , " pieper added , saying that plans to double capacity in the next six years are " very ambitious , " particularly as the years of big revenue improvement are likely over . this view was shared by nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership . " air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " he told bloomberg news service . i n vestme n t n eeded to battle domestic a n d europea n rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the no-frills sector is cut-throat and crowded air berlin was hoping to send a message to its rivals with the flotation that would underline its intent to battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . there were also big plans to take on competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor in the cut-throat and crowded german budget market sector . the disappointing trading on the opening day was in stark contrast to predictions that london-based investment firms were ready to plunder large swathes of air berlin stock .
a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g last week stated that the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain . expa n sio n pla n s may be de n ted by poor ipo showi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin 's high-flying plans could be grounded a poor performance on the stock exchange could put a sizeable dent in air berlin 's future plans .
according to reports , 50 percent of the new capital generated by the ipo had been earmarked for 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent would be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent would be used to refinance debt the airline currently has a fleet of 56 short-haul aircraft and mainly operates direct flights from airports across germany to mediterranean destinations including mainland spain , the balearic islands , greece , turkey and north africa .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2006 german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel defended the bnd 's role on its 50th anniversary while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .
chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .
spy chief ernst uhrlau told reporters at the anniversary event that the investigation had placed his agency in a " very difficult situation . " spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .
" we believe the government has nothing worthy of criticism that it needs to keep secret . " opposition parliamentarians are prepared to go to court if necessary to have key papers released and secret documents disclosed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight a selection of dw-world articles looking at the bnd affair and the role of germany 's secret service .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .
spy chief ernst uhrlau told reporters at the anniversary event that the investigation had placed his agency in a " very difficult situation . " spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .
" we believe the government has nothing worthy of criticism that it needs to keep secret .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.05.2006 german growth fails to meet expectations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts did n't think consumers would return to stores in 2006 's first quarter the german economy expanded modestly in the first three months of the year , after stagnating in the preceding three months , but growth nevertheless fell short of expectations , official data showed on thursday . german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose by 0.4 percent in the period from january to march , compared with the period from october to december , the federal statistics office destatis calculated in preliminary data . destatis said that growth impulses came from both inside and outside germany , which is the largest economy in the 12-country euro zone . " in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement . " the good sentiment of german businesses is increasingly being backed up by positive data , " economics minister michael glos commented .
" the economic upward movement will support the labor market recovery further . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic demand is expected to become more important domestic growth surprises analysts norbert braems of sal .
oppenheim consultancy said the increase in consumer spending was especially surprising . " all the indicators here did not look so good , " he told reuters .
" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .
on a calendar-adjusted basis , german first-quarter gdp expanded by 1.4 percent year-on-year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry should pick up after the cold winter growth helps fill empty tax coffers some analysts have predicted higher growth if sluggish construction industry could make up for weather-related lows this spring . " things will definitely speed up in the second quarter when construction catches up , " bhf bank 's gerd hassel told reuters .
" that means we can expect at least 1.5 percent growth for the entire year . " the german government has said it expects between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent growth for 2006 , which led finance experts thursday to increase how much tax revenue the government can expect to 463.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 590 billion -rrb- , 6.5 million euros more than their november forecast . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de within europe , germany drops down wealth ladder german prosperity levels are falling compared to other countries in western europe , a recent study showed .

but then investors quickly offloaded the shares , which slumped to an intraday low of 11.74 euros . air berlin , the third-biggest low-cost airline in europe , had set the issue price at the lower end of the so-called " book building " range of 11.50-14.50 euros on wednesday , meaning it could raise up to 510 million euros from the initial public offering . the airline was originally scheduled to float on may 5 but concerns over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector forced the company to reassess its flotation and it was postponed until may 11 . it is thought that that fall-out from the postponement and the continued doubts over the airline 's future stability may have contributed to the rapid tail-off in trading over the day .
analysts also expressed their concerns that the company had decided to go public before it proved itself . i n vestors wary of u n prove n compa n y with big pla n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the low end share offer could n't attract more punters " it 's a bit of a disappointing start , particularly as the issue price was at the low end of the range proposed by the company , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with bankhaus metzler , said in an interview .
" and it 's still difficult for the shares to hold at that level , which does n't bode very well . " their track record is not great .
they have posted steady operating losses in the past three years , " pieper added , saying that plans to double capacity in the next six years are " very ambitious , " particularly as the years of big revenue improvement are likely over . this view was shared by nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership . " air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " he told bloomberg news service . i n vestme n t n eeded to battle domestic a n d europea n rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the no-frills sector is cut-throat and crowded air berlin was hoping to send a message to its rivals with the flotation that would underline its intent to battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . there were also big plans to take on competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor in the cut-throat and crowded german budget market sector . the disappointing trading on the opening day was in stark contrast to predictions that london-based investment firms were ready to plunder large swathes of air berlin stock .
a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g last week stated that the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain . expa n sio n pla n s may be de n ted by poor ipo showi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin 's high-flying plans could be grounded a poor performance on the stock exchange could put a sizeable dent in air berlin 's future plans .
according to reports , 50 percent of the new capital generated by the ipo had been earmarked for 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent would be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent would be used to refinance debt the airline currently has a fleet of 56 short-haul aircraft and mainly operates direct flights from airports across germany to mediterranean destinations including mainland spain , the balearic islands , greece , turkey and north africa .

" yes , i 've heard of metro , " said nagesh kumaran , a 36-year-old farmer selling tomatoes and fresh red chilies piled high on the grimy grounds of a chaotic fruit and vegetable wholesale market a few kilometers away from the sanitized environment of metro .
" all they want to do is to ruin us financially . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local farmers and traders in bangalore are n't thrilled about metro 's arrival metro , which buys 98 percent of its stock in bangalore locally , denies this , arguing that it would offer farmers better margins by using modern methods of transportation and distribution . " about 35-40 percent of fruits and vegetables rot in transit in india due to transport delays and inadequate cold storage .
that also means lost money for farmers , " said harsh bahadur , ceo of metro india . he remembers the traders even going on a week-long protest when the metro group , one of the first foreign players to enter the indian wholesale market with two cash-and-carry centers in bangalore , first arrived in 2003 . " with 600 traders on strike for six days , there was no rice available in bangalore .
that 's the kind of pressure the government is under when it comes to letting in a foreign company . " door to indian market still closed , for now the dilemma is also representative of the bewildering minefield of central , state and local regulations that foreign investors eyeing india 's booming economy and its fast-growing middle class have to deal with . the country 's retail sector in particular is governed by rules that still bar foreign direct investment .
with more than 12 million small retailers in india and one in 25 families earning their livelihood in the sector , there are fears that an influx of foreign supermarket chains would drive millions out of business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath says trade barriers will be lowered slowly recently the indian government did allow foreign firms to hold up to a 51-percent stake in " single-brand " retail outlets .
but indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath has admitted the government is no hurry to relax barriers in the retail market . " we will open up one window after the after , " nath said .
" foreign investments in the retail sector must create jobs , not destroy them . " navigating the potholes metro 's bahadur says that metro has also had to navigate a confusing array of differing regional laws , tax rates and customs duties when it comes to transporting goods from one state to the other . the difficulty in buying land in india remains another huge deterrent .
" land titles are often not well-kept and disputed so there 's confusion about the real owner , " said bahadur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic snarls and congestion remain a huge problem in bangalore in addition , political instability in the state of karnataka has seen three governments come to power in the past three years , spelling doom for reforms and prompting metro to look at other indian states . worth all the trouble despite the stumbling blocks , metro insists its initial investments of 35 million euros in india thus far have been worth it .
it 's also announced plans to open three more cash-and-carry centers with investments totaling 300 million euros -lrb- $ 380 million -rrb- . given the sheer size and potential of the indian market , that 's hardly surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's surging domestic demand makes it attractive to foreign investors " let 's not forget that india has over 30 cities with more than one million inhabitants - we want a metro in every one of them , " said bahadur . a recent study by the a.t. kearney consultancy says india - with a trade volume of $ 330 billion and a yearly growth rate of 10 percent - is currently the most attractive place to invest for retail companies .
global players such as wal-mart are already knocking on the door , and even domestic giants such as reliance have plans to invest $ 2.2 billion in supermarkets . head start will pay off but metro says its head start has given it an edge .
bahadur points out that real estate prices have doubled in the time since metro set up shop and leased land in cities such as calcutta and hyderabad . " it 's true that you sometimes have to travel long thorny paths in india like metro not being allowed to sell all-important vegetables , grains and pulses , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of the metro group , at the recent hanover industrial fair .

" in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement . " the good sentiment of german businesses is increasingly being backed up by positive data , " economics minister michael glos commented .
" the economic upward movement will support the labor market recovery further . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic demand is expected to become more important domestic growth surprises analysts norbert braems of sal .
oppenheim consultancy said the increase in consumer spending was especially surprising . " all the indicators here did not look so good , " he told reuters .
" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .
on a calendar-adjusted basis , german first-quarter gdp expanded by 1.4 percent year-on-year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry should pick up after the cold winter growth helps fill empty tax coffers some analysts have predicted higher growth if sluggish construction industry could make up for weather-related lows this spring .

but then investors quickly offloaded the shares , which slumped to an intraday low of 11.74 euros . air berlin , the third-biggest low-cost airline in europe , had set the issue price at the lower end of the so-called " book building " range of 11.50-14.50 euros on wednesday , meaning it could raise up to 510 million euros from the initial public offering . the airline was originally scheduled to float on may 5 but concerns over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector forced the company to reassess its flotation and it was postponed until may 11 . it is thought that that fall-out from the postponement and the continued doubts over the airline 's future stability may have contributed to the rapid tail-off in trading over the day .

" and it 's still difficult for the shares to hold at that level , which does n't bode very well . " their track record is not great .
they have posted steady operating losses in the past three years , " pieper added , saying that plans to double capacity in the next six years are " very ambitious , " particularly as the years of big revenue improvement are likely over . this view was shared by nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership . " air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " he told bloomberg news service . i n vestme n t n eeded to battle domestic a n d europea n rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the no-frills sector is cut-throat and crowded air berlin was hoping to send a message to its rivals with the flotation that would underline its intent to battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . there were also big plans to take on competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor in the cut-throat and crowded german budget market sector . the disappointing trading on the opening day was in stark contrast to predictions that london-based investment firms were ready to plunder large swathes of air berlin stock .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .
spy chief ernst uhrlau told reporters at the anniversary event that the investigation had placed his agency in a " very difficult situation . " spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .
" we believe the government has nothing worthy of criticism that it needs to keep secret . " opposition parliamentarians are prepared to go to court if necessary to have key papers released and secret documents disclosed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight a selection of dw-world articles looking at the bnd affair and the role of germany 's secret service .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .

" spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .

" we have to realize that europe is not very popular among europeans , " she said in a speech to the german lower house of parliament . " we have to put citizens first . " to make the benefits of the eu clear , the german leader said europe needs to flex its economic muscles and prove it is capable of acting on the world stage .

" we have to realize that europe is not very popular among europeans , " she said in a speech to the german lower house of parliament . " we have to put citizens first . " to make the benefits of the eu clear , the german leader said europe needs to flex its economic muscles and prove it is capable of acting on the world stage . " europe has to show that it can mould world policy according to its own values , " merkel added . eu constitution and expansion need reexamination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch voted down the constitution last year merkel also said when germany takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in 2007 it would work to promote the european constitution despite its rejection by french and dutch voters last year .
the failure of national referendums in france and the netherlands threw the eu into one of its most difficult periods in its 50-year history . " we absolutely need the constitution to ensure the european union is effective and capable of action , " merkel said , but she also warned of moving too hastily .
" we must reflect how we can bring the constitution project to a successful conclusion . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , asked the 25-member union on wednesday not to make a final decision on the constitution until 2008 . merkel also addressed european expansion , another key issue that divides eu member states .
she said that bulgaria and romania - set to enter the bloc in 2007 or 2008 - would " clearly " become members .
but in an allusion to negotiations with turkey , she said expansion could not be a " one way street " and that the union needed alternatives to full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel discussed how the eu should open its doors to more countries " a body that does not have any borders can not act cohesively , " she said . before taking over as chancellor , merkel advocated a " privileged partnership " status for ankara and warned that full membership for the largely muslim country could prove too heavy a burden for the union . germany must meet euro criteria merkel defended economic measures germany has put in place to meet the european union 's stability and growth pact , which limits new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product .
germany plans to meet the rules in 2007 after breaching them for four years in a row . " it is not all right when we violate the stability pact for the third , fourth , fifth time because we do n't meet our own requirements , " merkel said . reaching europeans on an economic level is easiest when brussels works to revive the economy and lower unemployment , merkel said . " if we honestly answer these issues , then we will reach europeans and not just with words but with actions that follow the words , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso wants to delay decision on eu constitution european commission chief jose barroso urged eu leaders on wednesday to put off any decision on the bloc 's moribund constitution until at least 2008 .

but then investors quickly offloaded the shares , which slumped to an intraday low of 11.74 euros . air berlin , the third-biggest low-cost airline in europe , had set the issue price at the lower end of the so-called " book building " range of 11.50-14.50 euros on wednesday , meaning it could raise up to 510 million euros from the initial public offering . the airline was originally scheduled to float on may 5 but concerns over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector forced the company to reassess its flotation and it was postponed until may 11 . it is thought that that fall-out from the postponement and the continued doubts over the airline 's future stability may have contributed to the rapid tail-off in trading over the day .
analysts also expressed their concerns that the company had decided to go public before it proved itself . i n vestors wary of u n prove n compa n y with big pla n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the low end share offer could n't attract more punters " it 's a bit of a disappointing start , particularly as the issue price was at the low end of the range proposed by the company , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with bankhaus metzler , said in an interview .
" and it 's still difficult for the shares to hold at that level , which does n't bode very well . " their track record is not great .
they have posted steady operating losses in the past three years , " pieper added , saying that plans to double capacity in the next six years are " very ambitious , " particularly as the years of big revenue improvement are likely over . this view was shared by nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership . " air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " he told bloomberg news service . i n vestme n t n eeded to battle domestic a n d europea n rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the no-frills sector is cut-throat and crowded air berlin was hoping to send a message to its rivals with the flotation that would underline its intent to battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . there were also big plans to take on competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor in the cut-throat and crowded german budget market sector . the disappointing trading on the opening day was in stark contrast to predictions that london-based investment firms were ready to plunder large swathes of air berlin stock .
a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g last week stated that the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain . expa n sio n pla n s may be de n ted by poor ipo showi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin 's high-flying plans could be grounded a poor performance on the stock exchange could put a sizeable dent in air berlin 's future plans .
according to reports , 50 percent of the new capital generated by the ipo had been earmarked for 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent would be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent would be used to refinance debt the airline currently has a fleet of 56 short-haul aircraft and mainly operates direct flights from airports across germany to mediterranean destinations including mainland spain , the balearic islands , greece , turkey and north africa .
it hoped to use the allotted expansion funds to branch out into the scandinavian and eastern european markets , as well as growing in spain and the northern uk . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air berlin delays much anticipated flotation on stock exchange air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , was due to float on the frankfurt stock exchange friday in the company 's latest strategic move in the crowded low-cost market .

the summit will focus on trade but is not expected to produce any major agreements . it is the fourth such meeting , with the last eu-latin america-caribbean summit coming two years ago in guadalajara , mexico .
some 60 heads of state and government , as well as un secretary general kofi annan , are expected to attend . latin america 's superstar , cuban leader fidel castro , is not coming but presidents luiz inacio lula da silva of brazil , argentina 's nestor kirchner , mexico 's vicente fox , and chile 's michelle bachelet will be there as well as leftist national leaders hugo chavez of venezuela and evo morales of boliva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivia caused a stir when it nationalized its oil industry morales has made headlines by nationalizing the oil industry in his country and chavez probes a strongly anti-american , anti-imperialist line , despite his country being one of the united states ' major oil suppliers . there may be more sympathy in europe than in washington for the populist aspirations of such latin american leaders . european commissioner for foreign affairs benita ferrero-waldner said in march that " inequalities clear the way for populists to present themselves as leaders at certain times . " people want equality , want to do away with poverty , " she said . human rights will be a key theme during the summit .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking for austria as current eu president and host of the gathering , has said that social cohesion and the fight against poverty must be encouraged . on thursday , foreign ministers will debate " strengthening the bi-regional strategic association , " plassnik said in a statement on the austrian presidency 's web site for the summit . she said europe and latin america are " partners " and have the same values . the two regions each have about half a billion inhabitants and have evolved towards democracy . trade ties the eu is overall the largest investor in latin america , the major aid donor and the region 's second-largest trading partner , after the united states . bilateral trade increased 13 percent in 2005 to reach 118 billion euros -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- , according to eu statistics . there will be a " business forum , " attended by over 200 entrepreneurs , bankers and politicians , during the summit . but political analyst ramon torrent said at a recent seminar in vienna that the summit would focus on " political declarations rather than practical results . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu regularly holds talks with the four-nation south american mercosur bloc eneko landabaru , chief of external affairs at the european commission wants to get talks started on a free-trade agreement for the eu with central america , even if no customs agreements have been agreed after seven years of talks with the south american mercosur common market of brazil , argentina , uruguay and paraguay . local interests in the caribbean as well as the threat of a break-up of the andean community of nations , from which venezuela has pulled out , are obstacles to regional integration in latin america . more widespread trade agreements with the eu depend on such integration . on the other hand , say analysts , political problems in the eu keep it from reaching out more to latin america , which remains a key sphere of influence of the united states . after rejecting a european constitution , " the eu has neither the political leadership nor the decision-making ability to make latin america a key part of its overall world strategy , " said argentinian political analyst raul bernal-meza . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .

but it ’ s not been all smooth sailing for the group . metro 's vast cash-and-carry store in india 's it capital bangalore with its trademark blue and yellow logo looks like any other in europe .
the shelves are full of off-the-peg clothes , household goods and frozen seafood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash-and-carry center in bangalore offers off-the-peg clothes but in a country where more than 70 percent of the people are vegetarians , metro 's assortment suffers from a glaring lack of fresh fruit and vegetables . the puzzling exception is explained by legislation in a few indian states which prevents farmers from selling their wares directly to retailers .
in the state of karnataka too , of which bangalore is the capital , most farm produce must be bought and sold at government-run markets through a complicated system of middlemen and farmers . local resentment the result is not just a crippling financial disadvantage for metro - fruits and vegetables account for about 30 percent of trade turnover in india - but also a lobby of local traders resentful of the foreign wholesaler . " yes , i 've heard of metro , " said nagesh kumaran , a 36-year-old farmer selling tomatoes and fresh red chilies piled high on the grimy grounds of a chaotic fruit and vegetable wholesale market a few kilometers away from the sanitized environment of metro .
" all they want to do is to ruin us financially . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local farmers and traders in bangalore are n't thrilled about metro 's arrival metro , which buys 98 percent of its stock in bangalore locally , denies this , arguing that it would offer farmers better margins by using modern methods of transportation and distribution . " about 35-40 percent of fruits and vegetables rot in transit in india due to transport delays and inadequate cold storage .
that also means lost money for farmers , " said harsh bahadur , ceo of metro india . he remembers the traders even going on a week-long protest when the metro group , one of the first foreign players to enter the indian wholesale market with two cash-and-carry centers in bangalore , first arrived in 2003 . " with 600 traders on strike for six days , there was no rice available in bangalore .
that 's the kind of pressure the government is under when it comes to letting in a foreign company . " door to indian market still closed , for now the dilemma is also representative of the bewildering minefield of central , state and local regulations that foreign investors eyeing india 's booming economy and its fast-growing middle class have to deal with . the country 's retail sector in particular is governed by rules that still bar foreign direct investment .
with more than 12 million small retailers in india and one in 25 families earning their livelihood in the sector , there are fears that an influx of foreign supermarket chains would drive millions out of business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath says trade barriers will be lowered slowly recently the indian government did allow foreign firms to hold up to a 51-percent stake in " single-brand " retail outlets .
but indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath has admitted the government is no hurry to relax barriers in the retail market . " we will open up one window after the after , " nath said .
" foreign investments in the retail sector must create jobs , not destroy them . " navigating the potholes metro 's bahadur says that metro has also had to navigate a confusing array of differing regional laws , tax rates and customs duties when it comes to transporting goods from one state to the other . the difficulty in buying land in india remains another huge deterrent .
" land titles are often not well-kept and disputed so there 's confusion about the real owner , " said bahadur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic snarls and congestion remain a huge problem in bangalore in addition , political instability in the state of karnataka has seen three governments come to power in the past three years , spelling doom for reforms and prompting metro to look at other indian states . worth all the trouble despite the stumbling blocks , metro insists its initial investments of 35 million euros in india thus far have been worth it .
it 's also announced plans to open three more cash-and-carry centers with investments totaling 300 million euros -lrb- $ 380 million -rrb- . given the sheer size and potential of the indian market , that 's hardly surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's surging domestic demand makes it attractive to foreign investors " let 's not forget that india has over 30 cities with more than one million inhabitants - we want a metro in every one of them , " said bahadur . a recent study by the a.t. kearney consultancy says india - with a trade volume of $ 330 billion and a yearly growth rate of 10 percent - is currently the most attractive place to invest for retail companies .
global players such as wal-mart are already knocking on the door , and even domestic giants such as reliance have plans to invest $ 2.2 billion in supermarkets . head start will pay off but metro says its head start has given it an edge .
bahadur points out that real estate prices have doubled in the time since metro set up shop and leased land in cities such as calcutta and hyderabad . " it 's true that you sometimes have to travel long thorny paths in india like metro not being allowed to sell all-important vegetables , grains and pulses , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of the metro group , at the recent hanover industrial fair . " but we 're confident that in the end our efforts will pay off .

the party will be overshadowed , however , by the first working meeting of an 11-member parliamentary commission investigating allegations that german spies in baghdad aided the us in the 2003 invasion of iraq .
merkel has said the foreign intelligence agency - bnd - did relay information to the americans , but stressed that the agency did not help guide us bombers to their targets .

" left-wing crime totaled 4,898 offenses , an increase of 39.1 percent . however , the amount of right-wing crime with a racist background was down slightly from 2,553 in 2004 to 2,493 offenses . neo-nazi expelled from saxo n ia n parliame n t a german neo-nazi politician was meanwhile expelled from a parliamentary sitting in the eastern state of saxony for saying left-wingers should be taken away on trains , in a reference to the nazi death camp transports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichsenring -lrb- second from left -rrb- with party colleagues uwe leichsenring , a member of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , suggested that special trains were needed to take left-wingers who had a hand in may day unrest to the state prosecutor 's office to be charged . left party parliamentary group leader peter porsch retorted that such trains had been used in the past , to which leichsenring said : " yes , yes , and sometimes one thinks they should be brought back when i look at some people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2006 merkel makes case for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu to become more tangible to its citizens german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution . the eu 's greatest challenge is making it clear to ordinary citizens that they benefit from the bloc 's increased integration and expansion , merkel said in her first speech to parliament on european policy since she took power six months ago . " we have to realize that europe is not very popular among europeans , " she said in a speech to the german lower house of parliament . " we have to put citizens first . " to make the benefits of the eu clear , the german leader said europe needs to flex its economic muscles and prove it is capable of acting on the world stage . " europe has to show that it can mould world policy according to its own values , " merkel added . eu constitution and expansion need reexamination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch voted down the constitution last year merkel also said when germany takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in 2007 it would work to promote the european constitution despite its rejection by french and dutch voters last year .
the failure of national referendums in france and the netherlands threw the eu into one of its most difficult periods in its 50-year history . " we absolutely need the constitution to ensure the european union is effective and capable of action , " merkel said , but she also warned of moving too hastily .
" we must reflect how we can bring the constitution project to a successful conclusion . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , asked the 25-member union on wednesday not to make a final decision on the constitution until 2008 . merkel also addressed european expansion , another key issue that divides eu member states .
she said that bulgaria and romania - set to enter the bloc in 2007 or 2008 - would " clearly " become members .
but in an allusion to negotiations with turkey , she said expansion could not be a " one way street " and that the union needed alternatives to full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel discussed how the eu should open its doors to more countries " a body that does not have any borders can not act cohesively , " she said . before taking over as chancellor , merkel advocated a " privileged partnership " status for ankara and warned that full membership for the largely muslim country could prove too heavy a burden for the union . germany must meet euro criteria merkel defended economic measures germany has put in place to meet the european union 's stability and growth pact , which limits new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product .
germany plans to meet the rules in 2007 after breaching them for four years in a row . " it is not all right when we violate the stability pact for the third , fourth , fifth time because we do n't meet our own requirements , " merkel said . reaching europeans on an economic level is easiest when brussels works to revive the economy and lower unemployment , merkel said . " if we honestly answer these issues , then we will reach europeans and not just with words but with actions that follow the words , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso wants to delay decision on eu constitution european commission chief jose barroso urged eu leaders on wednesday to put off any decision on the bloc 's moribund constitution until at least 2008 .

but it ’ s not been all smooth sailing for the group . metro 's vast cash-and-carry store in india 's it capital bangalore with its trademark blue and yellow logo looks like any other in europe .
the shelves are full of off-the-peg clothes , household goods and frozen seafood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash-and-carry center in bangalore offers off-the-peg clothes but in a country where more than 70 percent of the people are vegetarians , metro 's assortment suffers from a glaring lack of fresh fruit and vegetables . the puzzling exception is explained by legislation in a few indian states which prevents farmers from selling their wares directly to retailers .
in the state of karnataka too , of which bangalore is the capital , most farm produce must be bought and sold at government-run markets through a complicated system of middlemen and farmers . local resentment the result is not just a crippling financial disadvantage for metro - fruits and vegetables account for about 30 percent of trade turnover in india - but also a lobby of local traders resentful of the foreign wholesaler . " yes , i 've heard of metro , " said nagesh kumaran , a 36-year-old farmer selling tomatoes and fresh red chilies piled high on the grimy grounds of a chaotic fruit and vegetable wholesale market a few kilometers away from the sanitized environment of metro .
" all they want to do is to ruin us financially . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local farmers and traders in bangalore are n't thrilled about metro 's arrival metro , which buys 98 percent of its stock in bangalore locally , denies this , arguing that it would offer farmers better margins by using modern methods of transportation and distribution . " about 35-40 percent of fruits and vegetables rot in transit in india due to transport delays and inadequate cold storage .
that also means lost money for farmers , " said harsh bahadur , ceo of metro india . he remembers the traders even going on a week-long protest when the metro group , one of the first foreign players to enter the indian wholesale market with two cash-and-carry centers in bangalore , first arrived in 2003 . " with 600 traders on strike for six days , there was no rice available in bangalore .
that 's the kind of pressure the government is under when it comes to letting in a foreign company . " door to indian market still closed , for now the dilemma is also representative of the bewildering minefield of central , state and local regulations that foreign investors eyeing india 's booming economy and its fast-growing middle class have to deal with . the country 's retail sector in particular is governed by rules that still bar foreign direct investment .
with more than 12 million small retailers in india and one in 25 families earning their livelihood in the sector , there are fears that an influx of foreign supermarket chains would drive millions out of business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath says trade barriers will be lowered slowly recently the indian government did allow foreign firms to hold up to a 51-percent stake in " single-brand " retail outlets .
but indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath has admitted the government is no hurry to relax barriers in the retail market . " we will open up one window after the after , " nath said .
" foreign investments in the retail sector must create jobs , not destroy them . " navigating the potholes metro 's bahadur says that metro has also had to navigate a confusing array of differing regional laws , tax rates and customs duties when it comes to transporting goods from one state to the other . the difficulty in buying land in india remains another huge deterrent .
" land titles are often not well-kept and disputed so there 's confusion about the real owner , " said bahadur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic snarls and congestion remain a huge problem in bangalore in addition , political instability in the state of karnataka has seen three governments come to power in the past three years , spelling doom for reforms and prompting metro to look at other indian states . worth all the trouble despite the stumbling blocks , metro insists its initial investments of 35 million euros in india thus far have been worth it .
it 's also announced plans to open three more cash-and-carry centers with investments totaling 300 million euros -lrb- $ 380 million -rrb- . given the sheer size and potential of the indian market , that 's hardly surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's surging domestic demand makes it attractive to foreign investors " let 's not forget that india has over 30 cities with more than one million inhabitants - we want a metro in every one of them , " said bahadur . a recent study by the a.t. kearney consultancy says india - with a trade volume of $ 330 billion and a yearly growth rate of 10 percent - is currently the most attractive place to invest for retail companies .
global players such as wal-mart are already knocking on the door , and even domestic giants such as reliance have plans to invest $ 2.2 billion in supermarkets . head start will pay off but metro says its head start has given it an edge .
bahadur points out that real estate prices have doubled in the time since metro set up shop and leased land in cities such as calcutta and hyderabad . " it 's true that you sometimes have to travel long thorny paths in india like metro not being allowed to sell all-important vegetables , grains and pulses , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of the metro group , at the recent hanover industrial fair . " but we 're confident that in the end our efforts will pay off .

" in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement . " the good sentiment of german businesses is increasingly being backed up by positive data , " economics minister michael glos commented .
" the economic upward movement will support the labor market recovery further . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic demand is expected to become more important domestic growth surprises analysts norbert braems of sal .
oppenheim consultancy said the increase in consumer spending was especially surprising . " all the indicators here did not look so good , " he told reuters .
" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .
on a calendar-adjusted basis , german first-quarter gdp expanded by 1.4 percent year-on-year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry should pick up after the cold winter growth helps fill empty tax coffers some analysts have predicted higher growth if sluggish construction industry could make up for weather-related lows this spring . " things will definitely speed up in the second quarter when construction catches up , " bhf bank 's gerd hassel told reuters .
" that means we can expect at least 1.5 percent growth for the entire year . " the german government has said it expects between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent growth for 2006 , which led finance experts thursday to increase how much tax revenue the government can expect to 463.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 590 billion -rrb- , 6.5 million euros more than their november forecast . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de within europe , germany drops down wealth ladder german prosperity levels are falling compared to other countries in western europe , a recent study showed .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .

the team led by coach silvia neid thus leads group 4 with 12 points , followed by russia with 9 points . watched by 9,200 spectators on a bright sunny day in the eastern german town of cottbus , the game held few thrilling moments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german striker petra wimbersky scores the winning goal with both star striker birgit prinz and defense whiz steffi jones laid up with injuries , the german team began on a furious note and clinched the winning goal from petra wimbersky in the third minute .
but the early goal failed to put the germans at ease and play was marked by uninspired passes and lost chances . during break , coach silvia neid was heard lecturing her team that they should n't underestimate " small " opponents ireland , which is currently world number 32 . even the second half failed to bring any relief , with a three-striker attack led by players from turbine potsdam , winner of germany 's dfb cup , unable to really break through ireland 's tightly-focused defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach silvia neid was pleased " the game was tiring , " coach neid said after the game .
" we started well as planned .
but then we made too many mistakes , " she said .
" but i ca n't accuse the team of not fighting enough or trying to score further . " the encounter marked the 273rd international game for the german women 's team - it was the first against ireland - and the 187th victory . but it 's evident that the team will have to do more if they want to repeat a world cup victory next year .

the team led by coach silvia neid thus leads group 4 with 12 points , followed by russia with 9 points . watched by 9,200 spectators on a bright sunny day in the eastern german town of cottbus , the game held few thrilling moments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german striker petra wimbersky scores the winning goal with both star striker birgit prinz and defense whiz steffi jones laid up with injuries , the german team began on a furious note and clinched the winning goal from petra wimbersky in the third minute .
but the early goal failed to put the germans at ease and play was marked by uninspired passes and lost chances . during break , coach silvia neid was heard lecturing her team that they should n't underestimate " small " opponents ireland , which is currently world number 32 . even the second half failed to bring any relief , with a three-striker attack led by players from turbine potsdam , winner of germany 's dfb cup , unable to really break through ireland 's tightly-focused defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach silvia neid was pleased " the game was tiring , " coach neid said after the game .

" the encounter marked the 273rd international game for the german women 's team - it was the first against ireland - and the 187th victory . but it 's evident that the team will have to do more if they want to repeat a world cup victory next year .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .

schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .
spy chief ernst uhrlau told reporters at the anniversary event that the investigation had placed his agency in a " very difficult situation . " spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .

the party will be overshadowed , however , by the first working meeting of an 11-member parliamentary commission investigating allegations that german spies in baghdad aided the us in the 2003 invasion of iraq .
merkel has said the foreign intelligence agency - bnd - did relay information to the americans , but stressed that the agency did not help guide us bombers to their targets .
among other questions , the inquiry will try to assess whether the us central intelligence agency used germany as a hub for secret flights carrying terror suspects between countries .
the committee will also look into whether the german government was aware of secret cia prisons in europe . leaders are to decide next week on whether or not the bnd will move its headquarters from pullach , near munich , to berlin .
the proposal is controversial as the move is estimated to cost between 1.4 million and 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 1.8 - $ 2.3 million -rrb- . dw-world.de germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd , says it delivers information that others do n't .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .

schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .

germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .

but then investors quickly offloaded the shares , which slumped to an intraday low of 11.74 euros . air berlin , the third-biggest low-cost airline in europe , had set the issue price at the lower end of the so-called " book building " range of 11.50-14.50 euros on wednesday , meaning it could raise up to 510 million euros from the initial public offering . the airline was originally scheduled to float on may 5 but concerns over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector forced the company to reassess its flotation and it was postponed until may 11 . it is thought that that fall-out from the postponement and the continued doubts over the airline 's future stability may have contributed to the rapid tail-off in trading over the day .
analysts also expressed their concerns that the company had decided to go public before it proved itself . i n vestors wary of u n prove n compa n y with big pla n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the low end share offer could n't attract more punters " it 's a bit of a disappointing start , particularly as the issue price was at the low end of the range proposed by the company , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with bankhaus metzler , said in an interview .
" and it 's still difficult for the shares to hold at that level , which does n't bode very well . " their track record is not great .
they have posted steady operating losses in the past three years , " pieper added , saying that plans to double capacity in the next six years are " very ambitious , " particularly as the years of big revenue improvement are likely over . this view was shared by nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .

but the government says it will continue programs to combat this development . politically-motivated crime in germany saw a sharp increase last year .
according to the federal interior ministry , 26,401 criminal offenses triggered by political motives were reported in 2005 - a rise of 24.7 percent .
this is the second highest level since this classification was introduced in 2001 . about half of these crimes are cleared up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the figures were " far from good . " schäuble said particularly the increase in politically-motivated violent crime from both sides of the political spectrum was " a cause for concern . "
it was up 36 percent to 2,448 offenses , which included assault , rioting or robbery .
this topped previous high of 2,368 politically-motivated violent crimes in 2001 . viole n t co n flicts betwee n political oppo n e n ts " one of the significant reasons for this may be that the conflicts with the respective political opponent particularly at rallies are increasingly riddled with violence , " schäuble said .
" it appears that progressively there is a development away from the traditional democratic culture of political debate to a heightened advocacy of one 's own ideological position based on violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence at protests keeps both sides from attacking each other schäuble said the government would counter such a development in a decisive manner . " we will continue the existing programs to combat right-wing extremism with full force and complement them with corresponding programs to combat extremist tendencies from other sectors , such as left-wing politically-motivated crime , " he said . schäuble called for support from the public . " we have to see to it that our democratic traditions and values are observed , " he said .
" this is also and mainly the case in the conflict with the respective political opponent . " majority of offe n ses come from the right-wi n g the largest proportion of politically-motivated crimes - 15,914 -lrb- up 26.8 percent -rrb- - was attributed to the right-wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is intent on getting politically-motivated crime figures down " more than two-thirds of these are so-called propaganda misdemeanors , such as the public use or distribution of unconstitutional forbidden symbols , " schäuble said .

the party will be overshadowed , however , by the first working meeting of an 11-member parliamentary commission investigating allegations that german spies in baghdad aided the us in the 2003 invasion of iraq .
merkel has said the foreign intelligence agency - bnd - did relay information to the americans , but stressed that the agency did not help guide us bombers to their targets .
among other questions , the inquiry will try to assess whether the us central intelligence agency used germany as a hub for secret flights carrying terror suspects between countries .
the committee will also look into whether the german government was aware of secret cia prisons in europe . leaders are to decide next week on whether or not the bnd will move its headquarters from pullach , near munich , to berlin .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .
spy chief ernst uhrlau told reporters at the anniversary event that the investigation had placed his agency in a " very difficult situation . " spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .
" we believe the government has nothing worthy of criticism that it needs to keep secret .

" in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement . " the good sentiment of german businesses is increasingly being backed up by positive data , " economics minister michael glos commented .
" the economic upward movement will support the labor market recovery further . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic demand is expected to become more important domestic growth surprises analysts norbert braems of sal .
oppenheim consultancy said the increase in consumer spending was especially surprising . " all the indicators here did not look so good , " he told reuters .
" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .
on a calendar-adjusted basis , german first-quarter gdp expanded by 1.4 percent year-on-year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry should pick up after the cold winter growth helps fill empty tax coffers some analysts have predicted higher growth if sluggish construction industry could make up for weather-related lows this spring . " things will definitely speed up in the second quarter when construction catches up , " bhf bank 's gerd hassel told reuters .
" that means we can expect at least 1.5 percent growth for the entire year . " the german government has said it expects between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent growth for 2006 , which led finance experts thursday to increase how much tax revenue the government can expect to 463.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 590 billion -rrb- , 6.5 million euros more than their november forecast . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de within europe , germany drops down wealth ladder german prosperity levels are falling compared to other countries in western europe , a recent study showed .

but it ’ s not been all smooth sailing for the group . metro 's vast cash-and-carry store in india 's it capital bangalore with its trademark blue and yellow logo looks like any other in europe .
the shelves are full of off-the-peg clothes , household goods and frozen seafood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash-and-carry center in bangalore offers off-the-peg clothes but in a country where more than 70 percent of the people are vegetarians , metro 's assortment suffers from a glaring lack of fresh fruit and vegetables . the puzzling exception is explained by legislation in a few indian states which prevents farmers from selling their wares directly to retailers .
in the state of karnataka too , of which bangalore is the capital , most farm produce must be bought and sold at government-run markets through a complicated system of middlemen and farmers . local resentment the result is not just a crippling financial disadvantage for metro - fruits and vegetables account for about 30 percent of trade turnover in india - but also a lobby of local traders resentful of the foreign wholesaler . " yes , i 've heard of metro , " said nagesh kumaran , a 36-year-old farmer selling tomatoes and fresh red chilies piled high on the grimy grounds of a chaotic fruit and vegetable wholesale market a few kilometers away from the sanitized environment of metro .
" all they want to do is to ruin us financially . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local farmers and traders in bangalore are n't thrilled about metro 's arrival metro , which buys 98 percent of its stock in bangalore locally , denies this , arguing that it would offer farmers better margins by using modern methods of transportation and distribution . " about 35-40 percent of fruits and vegetables rot in transit in india due to transport delays and inadequate cold storage .
that also means lost money for farmers , " said harsh bahadur , ceo of metro india . he remembers the traders even going on a week-long protest when the metro group , one of the first foreign players to enter the indian wholesale market with two cash-and-carry centers in bangalore , first arrived in 2003 . " with 600 traders on strike for six days , there was no rice available in bangalore .
that 's the kind of pressure the government is under when it comes to letting in a foreign company . " door to indian market still closed , for now the dilemma is also representative of the bewildering minefield of central , state and local regulations that foreign investors eyeing india 's booming economy and its fast-growing middle class have to deal with . the country 's retail sector in particular is governed by rules that still bar foreign direct investment .
with more than 12 million small retailers in india and one in 25 families earning their livelihood in the sector , there are fears that an influx of foreign supermarket chains would drive millions out of business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath says trade barriers will be lowered slowly recently the indian government did allow foreign firms to hold up to a 51-percent stake in " single-brand " retail outlets .
but indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath has admitted the government is no hurry to relax barriers in the retail market . " we will open up one window after the after , " nath said .
" foreign investments in the retail sector must create jobs , not destroy them . " navigating the potholes metro 's bahadur says that metro has also had to navigate a confusing array of differing regional laws , tax rates and customs duties when it comes to transporting goods from one state to the other . the difficulty in buying land in india remains another huge deterrent .
" land titles are often not well-kept and disputed so there 's confusion about the real owner , " said bahadur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic snarls and congestion remain a huge problem in bangalore in addition , political instability in the state of karnataka has seen three governments come to power in the past three years , spelling doom for reforms and prompting metro to look at other indian states . worth all the trouble despite the stumbling blocks , metro insists its initial investments of 35 million euros in india thus far have been worth it .
it 's also announced plans to open three more cash-and-carry centers with investments totaling 300 million euros -lrb- $ 380 million -rrb- . given the sheer size and potential of the indian market , that 's hardly surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's surging domestic demand makes it attractive to foreign investors " let 's not forget that india has over 30 cities with more than one million inhabitants - we want a metro in every one of them , " said bahadur . a recent study by the a.t. kearney consultancy says india - with a trade volume of $ 330 billion and a yearly growth rate of 10 percent - is currently the most attractive place to invest for retail companies .
global players such as wal-mart are already knocking on the door , and even domestic giants such as reliance have plans to invest $ 2.2 billion in supermarkets . head start will pay off but metro says its head start has given it an edge .
bahadur points out that real estate prices have doubled in the time since metro set up shop and leased land in cities such as calcutta and hyderabad . " it 's true that you sometimes have to travel long thorny paths in india like metro not being allowed to sell all-important vegetables , grains and pulses , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of the metro group , at the recent hanover industrial fair . " but we 're confident that in the end our efforts will pay off . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children .

sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office .

" we have to realize that europe is not very popular among europeans , " she said in a speech to the german lower house of parliament . " we have to put citizens first . " to make the benefits of the eu clear , the german leader said europe needs to flex its economic muscles and prove it is capable of acting on the world stage .

the failure of national referendums in france and the netherlands threw the eu into one of its most difficult periods in its 50-year history .

she said that bulgaria and romania - set to enter the bloc in 2007 or 2008 - would " clearly " become members .
but in an allusion to negotiations with turkey , she said expansion could not be a " one way street " and that the union needed alternatives to full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel discussed how the eu should open its doors to more countries " a body that does not have any borders can not act cohesively , " she said . before taking over as chancellor , merkel advocated a " privileged partnership " status for ankara and warned that full membership for the largely muslim country could prove too heavy a burden for the union . germany must meet euro criteria merkel defended economic measures germany has put in place to meet the european union 's stability and growth pact , which limits new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product .
germany plans to meet the rules in 2007 after breaching them for four years in a row . " it is not all right when we violate the stability pact for the third , fourth , fifth time because we do n't meet our own requirements , " merkel said . reaching europeans on an economic level is easiest when brussels works to revive the economy and lower unemployment , merkel said .

the team led by coach silvia neid thus leads group 4 with 12 points , followed by russia with 9 points . watched by 9,200 spectators on a bright sunny day in the eastern german town of cottbus , the game held few thrilling moments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german striker petra wimbersky scores the winning goal with both star striker birgit prinz and defense whiz steffi jones laid up with injuries , the german team began on a furious note and clinched the winning goal from petra wimbersky in the third minute .
but the early goal failed to put the germans at ease and play was marked by uninspired passes and lost chances . during break , coach silvia neid was heard lecturing her team that they should n't underestimate " small " opponents ireland , which is currently world number 32 . even the second half failed to bring any relief , with a three-striker attack led by players from turbine potsdam , winner of germany 's dfb cup , unable to really break through ireland 's tightly-focused defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach silvia neid was pleased " the game was tiring , " coach neid said after the game .
" we started well as planned .
but then we made too many mistakes , " she said .
" but i ca n't accuse the team of not fighting enough or trying to score further . " the encounter marked the 273rd international game for the german women 's team - it was the first against ireland - and the 187th victory . but it 's evident that the team will have to do more if they want to repeat a world cup victory next year .

but it ’ s not been all smooth sailing for the group . metro 's vast cash-and-carry store in india 's it capital bangalore with its trademark blue and yellow logo looks like any other in europe .
the shelves are full of off-the-peg clothes , household goods and frozen seafood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash-and-carry center in bangalore offers off-the-peg clothes but in a country where more than 70 percent of the people are vegetarians , metro 's assortment suffers from a glaring lack of fresh fruit and vegetables . the puzzling exception is explained by legislation in a few indian states which prevents farmers from selling their wares directly to retailers .
in the state of karnataka too , of which bangalore is the capital , most farm produce must be bought and sold at government-run markets through a complicated system of middlemen and farmers . local resentment the result is not just a crippling financial disadvantage for metro - fruits and vegetables account for about 30 percent of trade turnover in india - but also a lobby of local traders resentful of the foreign wholesaler . " yes , i 've heard of metro , " said nagesh kumaran , a 36-year-old farmer selling tomatoes and fresh red chilies piled high on the grimy grounds of a chaotic fruit and vegetable wholesale market a few kilometers away from the sanitized environment of metro .
" all they want to do is to ruin us financially . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local farmers and traders in bangalore are n't thrilled about metro 's arrival metro , which buys 98 percent of its stock in bangalore locally , denies this , arguing that it would offer farmers better margins by using modern methods of transportation and distribution . " about 35-40 percent of fruits and vegetables rot in transit in india due to transport delays and inadequate cold storage .
that also means lost money for farmers , " said harsh bahadur , ceo of metro india . he remembers the traders even going on a week-long protest when the metro group , one of the first foreign players to enter the indian wholesale market with two cash-and-carry centers in bangalore , first arrived in 2003 . " with 600 traders on strike for six days , there was no rice available in bangalore .
that 's the kind of pressure the government is under when it comes to letting in a foreign company . " door to indian market still closed , for now the dilemma is also representative of the bewildering minefield of central , state and local regulations that foreign investors eyeing india 's booming economy and its fast-growing middle class have to deal with . the country 's retail sector in particular is governed by rules that still bar foreign direct investment .
with more than 12 million small retailers in india and one in 25 families earning their livelihood in the sector , there are fears that an influx of foreign supermarket chains would drive millions out of business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath says trade barriers will be lowered slowly recently the indian government did allow foreign firms to hold up to a 51-percent stake in " single-brand " retail outlets .
but indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath has admitted the government is no hurry to relax barriers in the retail market . " we will open up one window after the after , " nath said .
" foreign investments in the retail sector must create jobs , not destroy them . " navigating the potholes metro 's bahadur says that metro has also had to navigate a confusing array of differing regional laws , tax rates and customs duties when it comes to transporting goods from one state to the other . the difficulty in buying land in india remains another huge deterrent .
" land titles are often not well-kept and disputed so there 's confusion about the real owner , " said bahadur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic snarls and congestion remain a huge problem in bangalore in addition , political instability in the state of karnataka has seen three governments come to power in the past three years , spelling doom for reforms and prompting metro to look at other indian states . worth all the trouble despite the stumbling blocks , metro insists its initial investments of 35 million euros in india thus far have been worth it .
it 's also announced plans to open three more cash-and-carry centers with investments totaling 300 million euros -lrb- $ 380 million -rrb- . given the sheer size and potential of the indian market , that 's hardly surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's surging domestic demand makes it attractive to foreign investors " let 's not forget that india has over 30 cities with more than one million inhabitants - we want a metro in every one of them , " said bahadur . a recent study by the a.t. kearney consultancy says india - with a trade volume of $ 330 billion and a yearly growth rate of 10 percent - is currently the most attractive place to invest for retail companies .
global players such as wal-mart are already knocking on the door , and even domestic giants such as reliance have plans to invest $ 2.2 billion in supermarkets . head start will pay off but metro says its head start has given it an edge .
bahadur points out that real estate prices have doubled in the time since metro set up shop and leased land in cities such as calcutta and hyderabad . " it 's true that you sometimes have to travel long thorny paths in india like metro not being allowed to sell all-important vegetables , grains and pulses , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of the metro group , at the recent hanover industrial fair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2006 german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel defended the bnd 's role on its 50th anniversary while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .
chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .
spy chief ernst uhrlau told reporters at the anniversary event that the investigation had placed his agency in a " very difficult situation . " spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .
" we believe the government has nothing worthy of criticism that it needs to keep secret . " opposition parliamentarians are prepared to go to court if necessary to have key papers released and secret documents disclosed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight a selection of dw-world articles looking at the bnd affair and the role of germany 's secret service .

-lrb- april 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany ’ s foreign intelligence agency turns 50 germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd , says it delivers information that others do n't .
over its 50-year history , it has employed former nazis and received much bad press , but has often proved it does good work .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .

the summit will focus on trade but is not expected to produce any major agreements . it is the fourth such meeting , with the last eu-latin america-caribbean summit coming two years ago in guadalajara , mexico .
some 60 heads of state and government , as well as un secretary general kofi annan , are expected to attend . latin america 's superstar , cuban leader fidel castro , is not coming but presidents luiz inacio lula da silva of brazil , argentina 's nestor kirchner , mexico 's vicente fox , and chile 's michelle bachelet will be there as well as leftist national leaders hugo chavez of venezuela and evo morales of boliva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivia caused a stir when it nationalized its oil industry morales has made headlines by nationalizing the oil industry in his country and chavez probes a strongly anti-american , anti-imperialist line , despite his country being one of the united states ' major oil suppliers . there may be more sympathy in europe than in washington for the populist aspirations of such latin american leaders . european commissioner for foreign affairs benita ferrero-waldner said in march that " inequalities clear the way for populists to present themselves as leaders at certain times . " people want equality , want to do away with poverty , " she said . human rights will be a key theme during the summit .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking for austria as current eu president and host of the gathering , has said that social cohesion and the fight against poverty must be encouraged . on thursday , foreign ministers will debate " strengthening the bi-regional strategic association , " plassnik said in a statement on the austrian presidency 's web site for the summit . she said europe and latin america are " partners " and have the same values . the two regions each have about half a billion inhabitants and have evolved towards democracy . trade ties the eu is overall the largest investor in latin america , the major aid donor and the region 's second-largest trading partner , after the united states . bilateral trade increased 13 percent in 2005 to reach 118 billion euros -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- , according to eu statistics . there will be a " business forum , " attended by over 200 entrepreneurs , bankers and politicians , during the summit . but political analyst ramon torrent said at a recent seminar in vienna that the summit would focus on " political declarations rather than practical results . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu regularly holds talks with the four-nation south american mercosur bloc eneko landabaru , chief of external affairs at the european commission wants to get talks started on a free-trade agreement for the eu with central america , even if no customs agreements have been agreed after seven years of talks with the south american mercosur common market of brazil , argentina , uruguay and paraguay . local interests in the caribbean as well as the threat of a break-up of the andean community of nations , from which venezuela has pulled out , are obstacles to regional integration in latin america . more widespread trade agreements with the eu depend on such integration . on the other hand , say analysts , political problems in the eu keep it from reaching out more to latin america , which remains a key sphere of influence of the united states . after rejecting a european constitution , " the eu has neither the political leadership nor the decision-making ability to make latin america a key part of its overall world strategy , " said argentinian political analyst raul bernal-meza . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .

" the main reason for this is the pleasing development in profit-orientated taxes , such as income tax , corporation tax and trade tax , " the ministry said . next year , tax revenues would amount to 494.0 billion euros , 22.3 billion euros more than previously budgeted , the ministry estimated . similarly , the tax revenue forecasts for 2008 and 2009 were revised upwards by 19.6 billion euros and 20.2 billion euros respectively , it continued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has violated the eu 's stability and growth pact for a number of years " the additional revenues will help germany meet the maastricht criteria again from 2007 , " the ministry said . under the terms of the eu stability and growth pact , eurozone members are not allowed to run up deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
but germany , the main architect of the pact , has been in breach of the 3.0-percent rule every year since 2002 . germany 's opposition has used the surprisingly positive tax revenue forecasts to call on the government to drop plans for a 3 percent increase in value-added tax starting 2007 which will take the tax rate to 19 percent . " taxes have to be lowered - that 's what the figures are telling us , " guido westerwelle , head of the free-market liberal fdp party said . even gregor gysi , head of the parliamentary group of the left party described the value-added tax hike as " socially unfair " and said it would particularly hurt small and mid-sized companies . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german growth fails to meet expectations the german economy expanded modestly in the first three months of the year , after stagnating in the preceding three months , but growth nevertheless fell short of expectations , official data showed on thursday .

but then investors quickly offloaded the shares , which slumped to an intraday low of 11.74 euros . air berlin , the third-biggest low-cost airline in europe , had set the issue price at the lower end of the so-called " book building " range of 11.50-14.50 euros on wednesday , meaning it could raise up to 510 million euros from the initial public offering . the airline was originally scheduled to float on may 5 but concerns over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector forced the company to reassess its flotation and it was postponed until may 11 . it is thought that that fall-out from the postponement and the continued doubts over the airline 's future stability may have contributed to the rapid tail-off in trading over the day .
analysts also expressed their concerns that the company had decided to go public before it proved itself . i n vestors wary of u n prove n compa n y with big pla n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the low end share offer could n't attract more punters " it 's a bit of a disappointing start , particularly as the issue price was at the low end of the range proposed by the company , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with bankhaus metzler , said in an interview .
" and it 's still difficult for the shares to hold at that level , which does n't bode very well . " their track record is not great .
they have posted steady operating losses in the past three years , " pieper added , saying that plans to double capacity in the next six years are " very ambitious , " particularly as the years of big revenue improvement are likely over . this view was shared by nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership . " air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " he told bloomberg news service . i n vestme n t n eeded to battle domestic a n d europea n rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the no-frills sector is cut-throat and crowded air berlin was hoping to send a message to its rivals with the flotation that would underline its intent to battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . there were also big plans to take on competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor in the cut-throat and crowded german budget market sector . the disappointing trading on the opening day was in stark contrast to predictions that london-based investment firms were ready to plunder large swathes of air berlin stock .
a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g last week stated that the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain . expa n sio n pla n s may be de n ted by poor ipo showi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin 's high-flying plans could be grounded a poor performance on the stock exchange could put a sizeable dent in air berlin 's future plans .
according to reports , 50 percent of the new capital generated by the ipo had been earmarked for 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent would be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent would be used to refinance debt the airline currently has a fleet of 56 short-haul aircraft and mainly operates direct flights from airports across germany to mediterranean destinations including mainland spain , the balearic islands , greece , turkey and north africa .
it hoped to use the allotted expansion funds to branch out into the scandinavian and eastern european markets , as well as growing in spain and the northern uk . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air berlin delays much anticipated flotation on stock exchange air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , was due to float on the frankfurt stock exchange friday in the company 's latest strategic move in the crowded low-cost market .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

but the government says it will continue programs to combat this development . politically-motivated crime in germany saw a sharp increase last year .
according to the federal interior ministry , 26,401 criminal offenses triggered by political motives were reported in 2005 - a rise of 24.7 percent .
this is the second highest level since this classification was introduced in 2001 . about half of these crimes are cleared up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the figures were " far from good . " schäuble said particularly the increase in politically-motivated violent crime from both sides of the political spectrum was " a cause for concern . "
it was up 36 percent to 2,448 offenses , which included assault , rioting or robbery .
this topped previous high of 2,368 politically-motivated violent crimes in 2001 . viole n t co n flicts betwee n political oppo n e n ts " one of the significant reasons for this may be that the conflicts with the respective political opponent particularly at rallies are increasingly riddled with violence , " schäuble said .
" it appears that progressively there is a development away from the traditional democratic culture of political debate to a heightened advocacy of one 's own ideological position based on violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence at protests keeps both sides from attacking each other schäuble said the government would counter such a development in a decisive manner . " we will continue the existing programs to combat right-wing extremism with full force and complement them with corresponding programs to combat extremist tendencies from other sectors , such as left-wing politically-motivated crime , " he said . schäuble called for support from the public . " we have to see to it that our democratic traditions and values are observed , " he said .
" this is also and mainly the case in the conflict with the respective political opponent . " majority of offe n ses come from the right-wi n g the largest proportion of politically-motivated crimes - 15,914 -lrb- up 26.8 percent -rrb- - was attributed to the right-wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is intent on getting politically-motivated crime figures down " more than two-thirds of these are so-called propaganda misdemeanors , such as the public use or distribution of unconstitutional forbidden symbols , " schäuble said .
" this behavior is criminally relevant and as such should be penalized by police and the judicial system . " left-wing crime totaled 4,898 offenses , an increase of 39.1 percent . however , the amount of right-wing crime with a racist background was down slightly from 2,553 in 2004 to 2,493 offenses . neo-nazi expelled from saxo n ia n parliame n t a german neo-nazi politician was meanwhile expelled from a parliamentary sitting in the eastern state of saxony for saying left-wingers should be taken away on trains , in a reference to the nazi death camp transports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichsenring -lrb- second from left -rrb- with party colleagues uwe leichsenring , a member of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , suggested that special trains were needed to take left-wingers who had a hand in may day unrest to the state prosecutor 's office to be charged . left party parliamentary group leader peter porsch retorted that such trains had been used in the past , to which leichsenring said : " yes , yes , and sometimes one thinks they should be brought back when i look at some people .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .

" in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement . " the good sentiment of german businesses is increasingly being backed up by positive data , " economics minister michael glos commented .
" the economic upward movement will support the labor market recovery further . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic demand is expected to become more important domestic growth surprises analysts norbert braems of sal .
oppenheim consultancy said the increase in consumer spending was especially surprising . " all the indicators here did not look so good , " he told reuters .
" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .
on a calendar-adjusted basis , german first-quarter gdp expanded by 1.4 percent year-on-year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry should pick up after the cold winter growth helps fill empty tax coffers some analysts have predicted higher growth if sluggish construction industry could make up for weather-related lows this spring . " things will definitely speed up in the second quarter when construction catches up , " bhf bank 's gerd hassel told reuters .
" that means we can expect at least 1.5 percent growth for the entire year . " the german government has said it expects between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent growth for 2006 , which led finance experts thursday to increase how much tax revenue the government can expect to 463.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 590 billion -rrb- , 6.5 million euros more than their november forecast . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de within europe , germany drops down wealth ladder german prosperity levels are falling compared to other countries in western europe , a recent study showed .

the team led by coach silvia neid thus leads group 4 with 12 points , followed by russia with 9 points . watched by 9,200 spectators on a bright sunny day in the eastern german town of cottbus , the game held few thrilling moments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german striker petra wimbersky scores the winning goal with both star striker birgit prinz and defense whiz steffi jones laid up with injuries , the german team began on a furious note and clinched the winning goal from petra wimbersky in the third minute .
but the early goal failed to put the germans at ease and play was marked by uninspired passes and lost chances . during break , coach silvia neid was heard lecturing her team that they should n't underestimate " small " opponents ireland , which is currently world number 32 . even the second half failed to bring any relief , with a three-striker attack led by players from turbine potsdam , winner of germany 's dfb cup , unable to really break through ireland 's tightly-focused defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach silvia neid was pleased " the game was tiring , " coach neid said after the game .
" we started well as planned .
but then we made too many mistakes , " she said .
" but i ca n't accuse the team of not fighting enough or trying to score further . " the encounter marked the 273rd international game for the german women 's team - it was the first against ireland - and the 187th victory . but it 's evident that the team will have to do more if they want to repeat a world cup victory next year .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

but the government says it will continue programs to combat this development . politically-motivated crime in germany saw a sharp increase last year .
according to the federal interior ministry , 26,401 criminal offenses triggered by political motives were reported in 2005 - a rise of 24.7 percent .
this is the second highest level since this classification was introduced in 2001 . about half of these crimes are cleared up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the figures were " far from good . " schäuble said particularly the increase in politically-motivated violent crime from both sides of the political spectrum was " a cause for concern . "
it was up 36 percent to 2,448 offenses , which included assault , rioting or robbery .
this topped previous high of 2,368 politically-motivated violent crimes in 2001 . viole n t co n flicts betwee n political oppo n e n ts " one of the significant reasons for this may be that the conflicts with the respective political opponent particularly at rallies are increasingly riddled with violence , " schäuble said .
" it appears that progressively there is a development away from the traditional democratic culture of political debate to a heightened advocacy of one 's own ideological position based on violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence at protests keeps both sides from attacking each other schäuble said the government would counter such a development in a decisive manner . " we will continue the existing programs to combat right-wing extremism with full force and complement them with corresponding programs to combat extremist tendencies from other sectors , such as left-wing politically-motivated crime , " he said . schäuble called for support from the public . " we have to see to it that our democratic traditions and values are observed , " he said .
" this is also and mainly the case in the conflict with the respective political opponent . " majority of offe n ses come from the right-wi n g the largest proportion of politically-motivated crimes - 15,914 -lrb- up 26.8 percent -rrb- - was attributed to the right-wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is intent on getting politically-motivated crime figures down " more than two-thirds of these are so-called propaganda misdemeanors , such as the public use or distribution of unconstitutional forbidden symbols , " schäuble said .
" this behavior is criminally relevant and as such should be penalized by police and the judicial system . " left-wing crime totaled 4,898 offenses , an increase of 39.1 percent . however , the amount of right-wing crime with a racist background was down slightly from 2,553 in 2004 to 2,493 offenses . neo-nazi expelled from saxo n ia n parliame n t a german neo-nazi politician was meanwhile expelled from a parliamentary sitting in the eastern state of saxony for saying left-wingers should be taken away on trains , in a reference to the nazi death camp transports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichsenring -lrb- second from left -rrb- with party colleagues uwe leichsenring , a member of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , suggested that special trains were needed to take left-wingers who had a hand in may day unrest to the state prosecutor 's office to be charged . left party parliamentary group leader peter porsch retorted that such trains had been used in the past , to which leichsenring said : " yes , yes , and sometimes one thinks they should be brought back when i look at some people .

the summit will focus on trade but is not expected to produce any major agreements . it is the fourth such meeting , with the last eu-latin america-caribbean summit coming two years ago in guadalajara , mexico .
some 60 heads of state and government , as well as un secretary general kofi annan , are expected to attend . latin america 's superstar , cuban leader fidel castro , is not coming but presidents luiz inacio lula da silva of brazil , argentina 's nestor kirchner , mexico 's vicente fox , and chile 's michelle bachelet will be there as well as leftist national leaders hugo chavez of venezuela and evo morales of boliva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivia caused a stir when it nationalized its oil industry morales has made headlines by nationalizing the oil industry in his country and chavez probes a strongly anti-american , anti-imperialist line , despite his country being one of the united states ' major oil suppliers . there may be more sympathy in europe than in washington for the populist aspirations of such latin american leaders . european commissioner for foreign affairs benita ferrero-waldner said in march that " inequalities clear the way for populists to present themselves as leaders at certain times . " people want equality , want to do away with poverty , " she said . human rights will be a key theme during the summit .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking for austria as current eu president and host of the gathering , has said that social cohesion and the fight against poverty must be encouraged . on thursday , foreign ministers will debate " strengthening the bi-regional strategic association , " plassnik said in a statement on the austrian presidency 's web site for the summit . she said europe and latin america are " partners " and have the same values . the two regions each have about half a billion inhabitants and have evolved towards democracy . trade ties the eu is overall the largest investor in latin america , the major aid donor and the region 's second-largest trading partner , after the united states . bilateral trade increased 13 percent in 2005 to reach 118 billion euros -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- , according to eu statistics . there will be a " business forum , " attended by over 200 entrepreneurs , bankers and politicians , during the summit . but political analyst ramon torrent said at a recent seminar in vienna that the summit would focus on " political declarations rather than practical results . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu regularly holds talks with the four-nation south american mercosur bloc eneko landabaru , chief of external affairs at the european commission wants to get talks started on a free-trade agreement for the eu with central america , even if no customs agreements have been agreed after seven years of talks with the south american mercosur common market of brazil , argentina , uruguay and paraguay . local interests in the caribbean as well as the threat of a break-up of the andean community of nations , from which venezuela has pulled out , are obstacles to regional integration in latin america . more widespread trade agreements with the eu depend on such integration . on the other hand , say analysts , political problems in the eu keep it from reaching out more to latin america , which remains a key sphere of influence of the united states . after rejecting a european constitution , " the eu has neither the political leadership nor the decision-making ability to make latin america a key part of its overall world strategy , " said argentinian political analyst raul bernal-meza . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .

but it ’ s not been all smooth sailing for the group . metro 's vast cash-and-carry store in india 's it capital bangalore with its trademark blue and yellow logo looks like any other in europe .
the shelves are full of off-the-peg clothes , household goods and frozen seafood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash-and-carry center in bangalore offers off-the-peg clothes but in a country where more than 70 percent of the people are vegetarians , metro 's assortment suffers from a glaring lack of fresh fruit and vegetables . the puzzling exception is explained by legislation in a few indian states which prevents farmers from selling their wares directly to retailers .
in the state of karnataka too , of which bangalore is the capital , most farm produce must be bought and sold at government-run markets through a complicated system of middlemen and farmers . local resentment the result is not just a crippling financial disadvantage for metro - fruits and vegetables account for about 30 percent of trade turnover in india - but also a lobby of local traders resentful of the foreign wholesaler . " yes , i 've heard of metro , " said nagesh kumaran , a 36-year-old farmer selling tomatoes and fresh red chilies piled high on the grimy grounds of a chaotic fruit and vegetable wholesale market a few kilometers away from the sanitized environment of metro .
" all they want to do is to ruin us financially . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local farmers and traders in bangalore are n't thrilled about metro 's arrival metro , which buys 98 percent of its stock in bangalore locally , denies this , arguing that it would offer farmers better margins by using modern methods of transportation and distribution . " about 35-40 percent of fruits and vegetables rot in transit in india due to transport delays and inadequate cold storage .
that also means lost money for farmers , " said harsh bahadur , ceo of metro india . he remembers the traders even going on a week-long protest when the metro group , one of the first foreign players to enter the indian wholesale market with two cash-and-carry centers in bangalore , first arrived in 2003 . " with 600 traders on strike for six days , there was no rice available in bangalore .
that 's the kind of pressure the government is under when it comes to letting in a foreign company . " door to indian market still closed , for now the dilemma is also representative of the bewildering minefield of central , state and local regulations that foreign investors eyeing india 's booming economy and its fast-growing middle class have to deal with . the country 's retail sector in particular is governed by rules that still bar foreign direct investment .
with more than 12 million small retailers in india and one in 25 families earning their livelihood in the sector , there are fears that an influx of foreign supermarket chains would drive millions out of business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath says trade barriers will be lowered slowly recently the indian government did allow foreign firms to hold up to a 51-percent stake in " single-brand " retail outlets .
but indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath has admitted the government is no hurry to relax barriers in the retail market . " we will open up one window after the after , " nath said .
" foreign investments in the retail sector must create jobs , not destroy them . " navigating the potholes metro 's bahadur says that metro has also had to navigate a confusing array of differing regional laws , tax rates and customs duties when it comes to transporting goods from one state to the other . the difficulty in buying land in india remains another huge deterrent .
" land titles are often not well-kept and disputed so there 's confusion about the real owner , " said bahadur . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic snarls and congestion remain a huge problem in bangalore in addition , political instability in the state of karnataka has seen three governments come to power in the past three years , spelling doom for reforms and prompting metro to look at other indian states . worth all the trouble despite the stumbling blocks , metro insists its initial investments of 35 million euros in india thus far have been worth it .
it 's also announced plans to open three more cash-and-carry centers with investments totaling 300 million euros -lrb- $ 380 million -rrb- . given the sheer size and potential of the indian market , that 's hardly surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's surging domestic demand makes it attractive to foreign investors " let 's not forget that india has over 30 cities with more than one million inhabitants - we want a metro in every one of them , " said bahadur . a recent study by the a.t. kearney consultancy says india - with a trade volume of $ 330 billion and a yearly growth rate of 10 percent - is currently the most attractive place to invest for retail companies .
global players such as wal-mart are already knocking on the door , and even domestic giants such as reliance have plans to invest $ 2.2 billion in supermarkets . head start will pay off but metro says its head start has given it an edge .
bahadur points out that real estate prices have doubled in the time since metro set up shop and leased land in cities such as calcutta and hyderabad . " it 's true that you sometimes have to travel long thorny paths in india like metro not being allowed to sell all-important vegetables , grains and pulses , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of the metro group , at the recent hanover industrial fair . " but we 're confident that in the end our efforts will pay off .

the committee will also look into whether the german government was aware of secret cia prisons in europe . leaders are to decide next week on whether or not the bnd will move its headquarters from pullach , near munich , to berlin .

but the government says it will continue programs to combat this development . politically-motivated crime in germany saw a sharp increase last year .
according to the federal interior ministry , 26,401 criminal offenses triggered by political motives were reported in 2005 - a rise of 24.7 percent .
this is the second highest level since this classification was introduced in 2001 . about half of these crimes are cleared up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the figures were " far from good . " schäuble said particularly the increase in politically-motivated violent crime from both sides of the political spectrum was " a cause for concern . "
it was up 36 percent to 2,448 offenses , which included assault , rioting or robbery .
this topped previous high of 2,368 politically-motivated violent crimes in 2001 . viole n t co n flicts betwee n political oppo n e n ts " one of the significant reasons for this may be that the conflicts with the respective political opponent particularly at rallies are increasingly riddled with violence , " schäuble said .
" it appears that progressively there is a development away from the traditional democratic culture of political debate to a heightened advocacy of one 's own ideological position based on violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence at protests keeps both sides from attacking each other schäuble said the government would counter such a development in a decisive manner . " we will continue the existing programs to combat right-wing extremism with full force and complement them with corresponding programs to combat extremist tendencies from other sectors , such as left-wing politically-motivated crime , " he said . schäuble called for support from the public . " we have to see to it that our democratic traditions and values are observed , " he said .
" this is also and mainly the case in the conflict with the respective political opponent . " majority of offe n ses come from the right-wi n g the largest proportion of politically-motivated crimes - 15,914 -lrb- up 26.8 percent -rrb- - was attributed to the right-wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is intent on getting politically-motivated crime figures down " more than two-thirds of these are so-called propaganda misdemeanors , such as the public use or distribution of unconstitutional forbidden symbols , " schäuble said .
" this behavior is criminally relevant and as such should be penalized by police and the judicial system . " left-wing crime totaled 4,898 offenses , an increase of 39.1 percent . however , the amount of right-wing crime with a racist background was down slightly from 2,553 in 2004 to 2,493 offenses . neo-nazi expelled from saxo n ia n parliame n t a german neo-nazi politician was meanwhile expelled from a parliamentary sitting in the eastern state of saxony for saying left-wingers should be taken away on trains , in a reference to the nazi death camp transports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leichsenring -lrb- second from left -rrb- with party colleagues uwe leichsenring , a member of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , suggested that special trains were needed to take left-wingers who had a hand in may day unrest to the state prosecutor 's office to be charged . left party parliamentary group leader peter porsch retorted that such trains had been used in the past , to which leichsenring said : " yes , yes , and sometimes one thinks they should be brought back when i look at some people .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

" in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement . " the good sentiment of german businesses is increasingly being backed up by positive data , " economics minister michael glos commented .
" the economic upward movement will support the labor market recovery further . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic demand is expected to become more important domestic growth surprises analysts norbert braems of sal .
oppenheim consultancy said the increase in consumer spending was especially surprising . " all the indicators here did not look so good , " he told reuters .
" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .
on a calendar-adjusted basis , german first-quarter gdp expanded by 1.4 percent year-on-year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry should pick up after the cold winter growth helps fill empty tax coffers some analysts have predicted higher growth if sluggish construction industry could make up for weather-related lows this spring . " things will definitely speed up in the second quarter when construction catches up , " bhf bank 's gerd hassel told reuters .

the summit will focus on trade but is not expected to produce any major agreements . it is the fourth such meeting , with the last eu-latin america-caribbean summit coming two years ago in guadalajara , mexico .
some 60 heads of state and government , as well as un secretary general kofi annan , are expected to attend . latin america 's superstar , cuban leader fidel castro , is not coming but presidents luiz inacio lula da silva of brazil , argentina 's nestor kirchner , mexico 's vicente fox , and chile 's michelle bachelet will be there as well as leftist national leaders hugo chavez of venezuela and evo morales of boliva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivia caused a stir when it nationalized its oil industry morales has made headlines by nationalizing the oil industry in his country and chavez probes a strongly anti-american , anti-imperialist line , despite his country being one of the united states ' major oil suppliers . there may be more sympathy in europe than in washington for the populist aspirations of such latin american leaders . european commissioner for foreign affairs benita ferrero-waldner said in march that " inequalities clear the way for populists to present themselves as leaders at certain times . " people want equality , want to do away with poverty , " she said . human rights will be a key theme during the summit .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking for austria as current eu president and host of the gathering , has said that social cohesion and the fight against poverty must be encouraged . on thursday , foreign ministers will debate " strengthening the bi-regional strategic association , " plassnik said in a statement on the austrian presidency 's web site for the summit . she said europe and latin america are " partners " and have the same values . the two regions each have about half a billion inhabitants and have evolved towards democracy . trade ties the eu is overall the largest investor in latin america , the major aid donor and the region 's second-largest trading partner , after the united states . bilateral trade increased 13 percent in 2005 to reach 118 billion euros -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- , according to eu statistics . there will be a " business forum , " attended by over 200 entrepreneurs , bankers and politicians , during the summit . but political analyst ramon torrent said at a recent seminar in vienna that the summit would focus on " political declarations rather than practical results . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu regularly holds talks with the four-nation south american mercosur bloc eneko landabaru , chief of external affairs at the european commission wants to get talks started on a free-trade agreement for the eu with central america , even if no customs agreements have been agreed after seven years of talks with the south american mercosur common market of brazil , argentina , uruguay and paraguay . local interests in the caribbean as well as the threat of a break-up of the andean community of nations , from which venezuela has pulled out , are obstacles to regional integration in latin america . more widespread trade agreements with the eu depend on such integration . on the other hand , say analysts , political problems in the eu keep it from reaching out more to latin america , which remains a key sphere of influence of the united states . after rejecting a european constitution , " the eu has neither the political leadership nor the decision-making ability to make latin america a key part of its overall world strategy , " said argentinian political analyst raul bernal-meza . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german foreign minister rediscovers latin america german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has completed his first trip to south america and concluded that the continent deserves more attention from the eu .

but it ’ s not been all smooth sailing for the group . metro 's vast cash-and-carry store in india 's it capital bangalore with its trademark blue and yellow logo looks like any other in europe .
the shelves are full of off-the-peg clothes , household goods and frozen seafood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash-and-carry center in bangalore offers off-the-peg clothes but in a country where more than 70 percent of the people are vegetarians , metro 's assortment suffers from a glaring lack of fresh fruit and vegetables . the puzzling exception is explained by legislation in a few indian states which prevents farmers from selling their wares directly to retailers .
in the state of karnataka too , of which bangalore is the capital , most farm produce must be bought and sold at government-run markets through a complicated system of middlemen and farmers . local resentment the result is not just a crippling financial disadvantage for metro - fruits and vegetables account for about 30 percent of trade turnover in india - but also a lobby of local traders resentful of the foreign wholesaler . " yes , i 've heard of metro , " said nagesh kumaran , a 36-year-old farmer selling tomatoes and fresh red chilies piled high on the grimy grounds of a chaotic fruit and vegetable wholesale market a few kilometers away from the sanitized environment of metro .
" all they want to do is to ruin us financially . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local farmers and traders in bangalore are n't thrilled about metro 's arrival metro , which buys 98 percent of its stock in bangalore locally , denies this , arguing that it would offer farmers better margins by using modern methods of transportation and distribution . " about 35-40 percent of fruits and vegetables rot in transit in india due to transport delays and inadequate cold storage .
that also means lost money for farmers , " said harsh bahadur , ceo of metro india . he remembers the traders even going on a week-long protest when the metro group , one of the first foreign players to enter the indian wholesale market with two cash-and-carry centers in bangalore , first arrived in 2003 . " with 600 traders on strike for six days , there was no rice available in bangalore .
that 's the kind of pressure the government is under when it comes to letting in a foreign company . " door to indian market still closed , for now the dilemma is also representative of the bewildering minefield of central , state and local regulations that foreign investors eyeing india 's booming economy and its fast-growing middle class have to deal with . the country 's retail sector in particular is governed by rules that still bar foreign direct investment .
with more than 12 million small retailers in india and one in 25 families earning their livelihood in the sector , there are fears that an influx of foreign supermarket chains would drive millions out of business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath says trade barriers will be lowered slowly recently the indian government did allow foreign firms to hold up to a 51-percent stake in " single-brand " retail outlets .
but indian trade and commerce minister kamal nath has admitted the government is no hurry to relax barriers in the retail market . " we will open up one window after the after , " nath said .
" foreign investments in the retail sector must create jobs , not destroy them .

" in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement . " the good sentiment of german businesses is increasingly being backed up by positive data , " economics minister michael glos commented .
" the economic upward movement will support the labor market recovery further . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic demand is expected to become more important domestic growth surprises analysts norbert braems of sal .
oppenheim consultancy said the increase in consumer spending was especially surprising . " all the indicators here did not look so good , " he told reuters .
" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .
on a calendar-adjusted basis , german first-quarter gdp expanded by 1.4 percent year-on-year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry should pick up after the cold winter growth helps fill empty tax coffers some analysts have predicted higher growth if sluggish construction industry could make up for weather-related lows this spring . " things will definitely speed up in the second quarter when construction catches up , " bhf bank 's gerd hassel told reuters .
" that means we can expect at least 1.5 percent growth for the entire year . " the german government has said it expects between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent growth for 2006 , which led finance experts thursday to increase how much tax revenue the government can expect to 463.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 590 billion -rrb- , 6.5 million euros more than their november forecast . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de within europe , germany drops down wealth ladder german prosperity levels are falling compared to other countries in western europe , a recent study showed .

" the encounter marked the 273rd international game for the german women 's team - it was the first against ireland - and the 187th victory . but it 's evident that the team will have to do more if they want to repeat a world cup victory next year .

global players such as wal-mart are already knocking on the door , and even domestic giants such as reliance have plans to invest $ 2.2 billion in supermarkets . head start will pay off but metro says its head start has given it an edge .

it 's also announced plans to open three more cash-and-carry centers with investments totaling 300 million euros -lrb- $ 380 million -rrb- . given the sheer size and potential of the indian market , that 's hardly surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's surging domestic demand makes it attractive to foreign investors " let 's not forget that india has over 30 cities with more than one million inhabitants - we want a metro in every one of them , " said bahadur . a recent study by the a.t. kearney consultancy says india - with a trade volume of $ 330 billion and a yearly growth rate of 10 percent - is currently the most attractive place to invest for retail companies .
global players such as wal-mart are already knocking on the door , and even domestic giants such as reliance have plans to invest $ 2.2 billion in supermarkets . head start will pay off but metro says its head start has given it an edge .
bahadur points out that real estate prices have doubled in the time since metro set up shop and leased land in cities such as calcutta and hyderabad . " it 's true that you sometimes have to travel long thorny paths in india like metro not being allowed to sell all-important vegetables , grains and pulses , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of the metro group , at the recent hanover industrial fair . " but we 're confident that in the end our efforts will pay off .

the summit will focus on trade but is not expected to produce any major agreements . it is the fourth such meeting , with the last eu-latin america-caribbean summit coming two years ago in guadalajara , mexico .
some 60 heads of state and government , as well as un secretary general kofi annan , are expected to attend . latin america 's superstar , cuban leader fidel castro , is not coming but presidents luiz inacio lula da silva of brazil , argentina 's nestor kirchner , mexico 's vicente fox , and chile 's michelle bachelet will be there as well as leftist national leaders hugo chavez of venezuela and evo morales of boliva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivia caused a stir when it nationalized its oil industry morales has made headlines by nationalizing the oil industry in his country and chavez probes a strongly anti-american , anti-imperialist line , despite his country being one of the united states ' major oil suppliers . there may be more sympathy in europe than in washington for the populist aspirations of such latin american leaders . european commissioner for foreign affairs benita ferrero-waldner said in march that " inequalities clear the way for populists to present themselves as leaders at certain times . " people want equality , want to do away with poverty , " she said . human rights will be a key theme during the summit .
austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking for austria as current eu president and host of the gathering , has said that social cohesion and the fight against poverty must be encouraged . on thursday , foreign ministers will debate " strengthening the bi-regional strategic association , " plassnik said in a statement on the austrian presidency 's web site for the summit . she said europe and latin america are " partners " and have the same values . the two regions each have about half a billion inhabitants and have evolved towards democracy . trade ties the eu is overall the largest investor in latin america , the major aid donor and the region 's second-largest trading partner , after the united states . bilateral trade increased 13 percent in 2005 to reach 118 billion euros -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- , according to eu statistics . there will be a " business forum , " attended by over 200 entrepreneurs , bankers and politicians , during the summit . but political analyst ramon torrent said at a recent seminar in vienna that the summit would focus on " political declarations rather than practical results .

" in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement . " the good sentiment of german businesses is increasingly being backed up by positive data , " economics minister michael glos commented .
" the economic upward movement will support the labor market recovery further . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic demand is expected to become more important domestic growth surprises analysts norbert braems of sal .
oppenheim consultancy said the increase in consumer spending was especially surprising . " all the indicators here did not look so good , " he told reuters .
" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .
on a calendar-adjusted basis , german first-quarter gdp expanded by 1.4 percent year-on-year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry should pick up after the cold winter growth helps fill empty tax coffers some analysts have predicted higher growth if sluggish construction industry could make up for weather-related lows this spring . " things will definitely speed up in the second quarter when construction catches up , " bhf bank 's gerd hassel told reuters .
" that means we can expect at least 1.5 percent growth for the entire year . " the german government has said it expects between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent growth for 2006 , which led finance experts thursday to increase how much tax revenue the government can expect to 463.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 590 billion -rrb- , 6.5 million euros more than their november forecast . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de within europe , germany drops down wealth ladder german prosperity levels are falling compared to other countries in western europe , a recent study showed .

" in addition to foreign trade , private consumption and investment in equipment also contributed to the pick-up in the economy at the start of 2006 , " the statisticians said in a statement . " the good sentiment of german businesses is increasingly being backed up by positive data , " economics minister michael glos commented .
" the economic upward movement will support the labor market recovery further . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic demand is expected to become more important domestic growth surprises analysts norbert braems of sal .
oppenheim consultancy said the increase in consumer spending was especially surprising . " all the indicators here did not look so good , " he told reuters .
" domestic demand will become more meaningful for economic growth and the net exports will be less dynamic , that would be the normal development . " nevertheless , first-quarter growth did not quite meet expectations : analysts had been penciling in slightly stronger growth of 0.6 percent , and the german institute for economic research forecast a 0.5-percent increase . " this is a good start in the new year but still remains behind expectations , " sebastian wanke of dekabank told reuters . on a 12-month basis , however , german gdp expanded by 2.9 percent in the january-march period , the strongest rate of growth in six years , destatis calculated . that was largely due to calendar effects : given the late timing of the easter holidays this year , there were three more working days in the first quarter of 2006 than the same period in 2005 , the statisticians noted .
on a calendar-adjusted basis , german first-quarter gdp expanded by 1.4 percent year-on-year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry should pick up after the cold winter growth helps fill empty tax coffers some analysts have predicted higher growth if sluggish construction industry could make up for weather-related lows this spring . " things will definitely speed up in the second quarter when construction catches up , " bhf bank 's gerd hassel told reuters .
" that means we can expect at least 1.5 percent growth for the entire year . " the german government has said it expects between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent growth for 2006 , which led finance experts thursday to increase how much tax revenue the government can expect to 463.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 590 billion -rrb- , 6.5 million euros more than their november forecast . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de within europe , germany drops down wealth ladder german prosperity levels are falling compared to other countries in western europe , a recent study showed .

the team led by coach silvia neid thus leads group 4 with 12 points , followed by russia with 9 points . watched by 9,200 spectators on a bright sunny day in the eastern german town of cottbus , the game held few thrilling moments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german striker petra wimbersky scores the winning goal with both star striker birgit prinz and defense whiz steffi jones laid up with injuries , the german team began on a furious note and clinched the winning goal from petra wimbersky in the third minute .
but the early goal failed to put the germans at ease and play was marked by uninspired passes and lost chances . during break , coach silvia neid was heard lecturing her team that they should n't underestimate " small " opponents ireland , which is currently world number 32 . even the second half failed to bring any relief , with a three-striker attack led by players from turbine potsdam , winner of germany 's dfb cup , unable to really break through ireland 's tightly-focused defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach silvia neid was pleased " the game was tiring , " coach neid said after the game .
" we started well as planned .
but then we made too many mistakes , " she said .
" but i ca n't accuse the team of not fighting enough or trying to score further . " the encounter marked the 273rd international game for the german women 's team - it was the first against ireland - and the 187th victory . but it 's evident that the team will have to do more if they want to repeat a world cup victory next year .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .

schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .

but then investors quickly offloaded the shares , which slumped to an intraday low of 11.74 euros . air berlin , the third-biggest low-cost airline in europe , had set the issue price at the lower end of the so-called " book building " range of 11.50-14.50 euros on wednesday , meaning it could raise up to 510 million euros from the initial public offering . the airline was originally scheduled to float on may 5 but concerns over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector forced the company to reassess its flotation and it was postponed until may 11 . it is thought that that fall-out from the postponement and the continued doubts over the airline 's future stability may have contributed to the rapid tail-off in trading over the day .
analysts also expressed their concerns that the company had decided to go public before it proved itself . i n vestors wary of u n prove n compa n y with big pla n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the low end share offer could n't attract more punters " it 's a bit of a disappointing start , particularly as the issue price was at the low end of the range proposed by the company , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with bankhaus metzler , said in an interview .
" and it 's still difficult for the shares to hold at that level , which does n't bode very well . " their track record is not great .
they have posted steady operating losses in the past three years , " pieper added , saying that plans to double capacity in the next six years are " very ambitious , " particularly as the years of big revenue improvement are likely over . this view was shared by nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership . " air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " he told bloomberg news service . i n vestme n t n eeded to battle domestic a n d europea n rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the no-frills sector is cut-throat and crowded air berlin was hoping to send a message to its rivals with the flotation that would underline its intent to battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . there were also big plans to take on competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor in the cut-throat and crowded german budget market sector . the disappointing trading on the opening day was in stark contrast to predictions that london-based investment firms were ready to plunder large swathes of air berlin stock .
a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g last week stated that the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain . expa n sio n pla n s may be de n ted by poor ipo showi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin 's high-flying plans could be grounded a poor performance on the stock exchange could put a sizeable dent in air berlin 's future plans .
according to reports , 50 percent of the new capital generated by the ipo had been earmarked for 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent would be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent would be used to refinance debt the airline currently has a fleet of 56 short-haul aircraft and mainly operates direct flights from airports across germany to mediterranean destinations including mainland spain , the balearic islands , greece , turkey and north africa .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .

schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .

chancellor angela merkel came to the body 's defense . as far as birthday celebrations go , it was a rather somber affair .
germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- , marked its 50th anniversary thursday , but there were few birthday celebrations as members of the german parliament presented the agency with the dubious gift of a sensitive inquiry into the role of german spies in the iraq war . german chancellor angela merkel , attending the birthday bash in berlin , attempted to keep spirits up by defending the bnd and championing the continuance of security cooperation with the united states . " i wish for only one thing from the investigation : that the need for the intelligence work of the security services should in no way be brought into question , " merkel said in a speech .
members of the bnd would have been excused for hoping that this wish was not the one she made while blowing out any candles in their honor .
if speaking it aloud negates the wish then the agency is in for a hard time . experts believe that the bnd will suffer regardless ; a view shared by the agency 's top brass .
spy chief ernst uhrlau told reporters at the anniversary event that the investigation had placed his agency in a " very difficult situation . " spotlight to fall o n iraq role a n d cia missio n s i n europe the inquiry , which started thursday after being forced by the opposition against the wishes of the government , is expected to run for months .
it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .
nut social democrats in her cabinet , specifically foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , could be embarrassed by revelations . steinmeier was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff when german spies in baghdad allegedly helped the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and was responsible for the security services at the time .
schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .
" we believe the government has nothing worthy of criticism that it needs to keep secret . " opposition parliamentarians are prepared to go to court if necessary to have key papers released and secret documents disclosed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's foreign intelligence agency in the spotlight a selection of dw-world articles looking at the bnd affair and the role of germany 's secret service .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

it could not only damage the trust of foreign partners in germany 's security services but also stir anti-american feeling by keeping the iraq war in the public spotlight . merkel moved to prevent that happening by adding in her speech that intelligence cooperation with washington would remain " not only important but necessary " in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia 's role in europe will also be examined however , such resolve may ultimately prove to be foolishly misplaced as the council of europe human rights forum continues to investigate cia flights and allegations that the us agency ran secret prisons in europe with collusion from eu member states . the inquiry is also expected to investigate the possibility that the cia used germany as a staging post for secret flights carrying terrorist suspects between countries . former schröder aide stei n meier to be summo n ed the chancellor herself is not threatened by the investigation into the bnd 's involvement in iraq as she was not in office at the time .

schröder was strongly critical of the war in public and his stance helped to secure the 2002 general election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's proximity to the case could be damaging if it is proved that the germans passed on information to the americans in regard to targets for military strikes , it would be extremely damaging for steinmeier - who is expected to have to testify .
it would also have a knock-on , albeit indirect , effect on merkel and her government . gover n me n t challe n ges oppositio n to fi n d evide n ce the government has admitted that the bnd assisted the us military in providing information on the police and army presence in baghdad , but that has denied that bnd agents helped to guide us bombers to their targets .
spd lawmaker thomas oppermann said his party wanted full transparency . " we have nothing to hide , " he told reporters . oppermann added that he believed the affair had largely been dealt with , and challenged the opposition to show there were still questions that needed answering . " an issue concerning the security services has probably never been so thoroughly cleared up in a democratic country , " he said .
" we believe the government has nothing worthy of criticism that it needs to keep secret .

" taxes have to be lowered - that 's what the figures are telling us , " guido westerwelle , head of the free-market liberal fdp party said . even gregor gysi , head of the parliamentary group of the left party described the value-added tax hike as " socially unfair " and said it would particularly hurt small and mid-sized companies . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german growth fails to meet expectations the german economy expanded modestly in the first three months of the year , after stagnating in the preceding three months , but growth nevertheless fell short of expectations , official data showed on thursday .

" we have to realize that europe is not very popular among europeans , " she said in a speech to the german lower house of parliament . " we have to put citizens first . " to make the benefits of the eu clear , the german leader said europe needs to flex its economic muscles and prove it is capable of acting on the world stage . " europe has to show that it can mould world policy according to its own values , " merkel added . eu constitution and expansion need reexamination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch voted down the constitution last year merkel also said when germany takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in 2007 it would work to promote the european constitution despite its rejection by french and dutch voters last year .
the failure of national referendums in france and the netherlands threw the eu into one of its most difficult periods in its 50-year history . " we absolutely need the constitution to ensure the european union is effective and capable of action , " merkel said , but she also warned of moving too hastily .
" we must reflect how we can bring the constitution project to a successful conclusion . " eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , asked the 25-member union on wednesday not to make a final decision on the constitution until 2008 . merkel also addressed european expansion , another key issue that divides eu member states .
she said that bulgaria and romania - set to enter the bloc in 2007 or 2008 - would " clearly " become members .
but in an allusion to negotiations with turkey , she said expansion could not be a " one way street " and that the union needed alternatives to full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel discussed how the eu should open its doors to more countries " a body that does not have any borders can not act cohesively , " she said . before taking over as chancellor , merkel advocated a " privileged partnership " status for ankara and warned that full membership for the largely muslim country could prove too heavy a burden for the union . germany must meet euro criteria merkel defended economic measures germany has put in place to meet the european union 's stability and growth pact , which limits new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product .
germany plans to meet the rules in 2007 after breaching them for four years in a row . " it is not all right when we violate the stability pact for the third , fourth , fifth time because we do n't meet our own requirements , " merkel said . reaching europeans on an economic level is easiest when brussels works to revive the economy and lower unemployment , merkel said .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .
sweden and greece are again at the extremes , reaching 56 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
france , with 48 percent , and germany at 28 percent fill out the middle ground , according to eurostat , the european union 's statistics office . " much of it has to do with the modernization of women 's role , " dirk konietzka , who coauthor of a survey conducted in 2003 by the max planck institute for demographic research told the christia n scie n ce mo n itor .

marriage is on the wane all over europe , as couples prefer living together to walking down the aisle , according to a study published thursday . while wedding bells are ringing for fewer europeans overall , altars are getting downright dusty in some countries as national differences across the continent remain marked , a study by france 's national institute of demographic studies -lrb- ined -rrb- found . some 38 percent of women and 30 percent of men in germany see marriage as a necessary part of living together , according to a recent study conducted by the federal statistics office . the ined survey of 20 european countries found three main reasons for the trend : people tend to form stable , long-term relationships later in life ; they are more inclined to move in together without getting married ; and they are less bothered about cementing their union in marriage later on . couples breaki n g up more ofte n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i 'll take half of that , thank you very much despite experiencing relationships and living together before marriage , couples are apparently no better equipped to get along after pronouncing their vows , according to the ined . the study pointed out that a higher cohabitation rate is generally matched by a higher divorce rate and that couples in europe break up more readily than they used to . " new conjugal practices appeared in the late 1960s in scandinavia , notably in sweden , and then gradually spread across europe , " noted france prioux , author of the ined study .
she added that society no longer draws major distinctions between married and unmarried couples . " but the trends are going in the same direction everywhere , " she added .
" there is still great variety in how couples live , and how long they stay together , from country to country . " north-south marriage divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a much more common scene in southern europe while the proportion of cohabitations that ultimately lead to marriage has fallen dramatically in scandinavia - less than a tenth of swedish couples tie the knot after living together for two years - it has risen in spain and italy , showing that " these countries remain attached to the institution of marriage , " according to prioux . the duration of relationships is also on the decline all over europe , but their average length still varies markedly from country to country , with the north-south divide again very much in evidence . in 2003 , more than half of swedish , belgian and finnish marriages could be expected to end in divorce , compared to less than a fifth in greece and italy . between those extremes , france " is beginning to look more and more like the nordic countries , " prioux noted , while germany and austria " also seem to have adopted unmarried cohabitation as a norm , while remaining keen on marriage , especially when the couple has children . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many couples would rather live together than exchange wedding bands " fewer reaso n s to get married " one third of children are born out of wedlock , six times higher than was the case 35 years ago .

the deal calls for an emergency loan to finance a $ 740m -lrb- £ 406m -rrb- shortfall in the us territory 's budget .
the deal was brokered by a special commission set up to resolve a dispute between the governor and lower-house legislators on how to fix the deficit .
it is unclear if unions will still hold protests , planned for thursday .
members of the opposition-led lower house will continue debating the terms of a sales tax which governor anibal acevedo vila had proposed as a way of financing the loan .
the governor 's earlier proposal - calling for the introduction of a 7 % sales tax for the island - was rejected by lawmakers .
rating downgraded governor acevedo told the associated press news agency the deal reached on wednesday would secure a loan to pay for government salaries for the rest of the fiscal year , until 30 june .
he said public sector employees would be able to return to work on monday .
politicians have been arguing for weeks on a formula for financing an emergency loan .
the crisis led international credit rating agency moody 's to downgrade puerto rico 's bonds .
moody 's gave some of the bonds junk status while some were downgraded to just one notch above .
demonstrations last week , the administration was forced to close 43 government agencies putting 95,000 people out of work .
all schools were closed , meaning half a million students were sent home .
mass demonstrations have been taking place on the streets of the capital , san juan , but it is in the island 's smaller towns that the effects are being felt .
many people rely heavily on municipal services and are now having to do without basic amenities like water and health care services .
the government is the biggest employer in puerto rico , accounting for up to 200,000 jobs .
it pays about $ 500m in salaries .

a royal society report calls for scientists to weigh up carefully the likely impact of their statements before talking about research results .
the society said errors were not confined to misreporting by the media .
it said experts should consider public interest , not just whether the research would be interesting to the public .
professor sir patrick bateson , who chaired the working group that produced the report , said : " we are very concerned that scientists should learn to produce good lay summaries of what they 're doing .
" we 're also concerned about people sometimes producing work which is damaging , " he told bbc five live .
" there 's a famous case of the triple vaccine - the mmr - which led to a report in the press that then led to lots of people not having their children vaccinated . "
mmr concerns in the case of the mmr vaccine , the catalyst for the media reports had been a study published in the respected medical journal the lancet .
the fuss over gm crops in britain began after a professor at a respected institute said his experiments showed that biotech potatoes had stunted the growth of lab rats - his statement was made before other scientists had had a chance to check his work .
the fallout was exacerbated when the british medical association said that it , too , had worries about gm foods ; but this statement of concern was retracted after the organisation discovered famine-struck nations were turning away much needed food aid because of the advice .
the royal society report cautions scientists and journalists when publicising research presented at conferences .
this material may be preliminary , it says , and the public interest would not be served if the research was later " shown to be wrong after being checked by peer review " .
the royal society working group also noted that some misleading media reports had occurred because scientists had not checked press releases for accuracy .
lord rees , the president of the royal society , said : " recent episodes such as the high-profile discrediting of papers on cloning are likely to bring the quality and reliability of all research under greater scrutiny .
" even when a result is firm , it is important to convey its impact fairly - neither over-hyping potential spin-offs nor exaggerating potential risks . "
bbc science correspondent pallab ghosh said the royal society 's report would raise concerns in some quarters that the advice it was giving to researchers could lead to a form of self-censorship and ultimately stifle scientific debate .

a royal society report calls for scientists to weigh up carefully the likely impact of their statements before talking about research results .
the society said errors were not confined to misreporting by the media .
it said experts should consider public interest , not just whether the research would be interesting to the public .
professor sir patrick bateson , who chaired the working group that produced the report , said : " we are very concerned that scientists should learn to produce good lay summaries of what they 're doing .
" we 're also concerned about people sometimes producing work which is damaging , " he told bbc five live .
" there 's a famous case of the triple vaccine - the mmr - which led to a report in the press that then led to lots of people not having their children vaccinated . "
mmr concerns in the case of the mmr vaccine , the catalyst for the media reports had been a study published in the respected medical journal the lancet .
the fuss over gm crops in britain began after a professor at a respected institute said his experiments showed that biotech potatoes had stunted the growth of lab rats - his statement was made before other scientists had had a chance to check his work .
the fallout was exacerbated when the british medical association said that it , too , had worries about gm foods ; but this statement of concern was retracted after the organisation discovered famine-struck nations were turning away much needed food aid because of the advice .
the royal society report cautions scientists and journalists when publicising research presented at conferences .
this material may be preliminary , it says , and the public interest would not be served if the research was later " shown to be wrong after being checked by peer review " .
the royal society working group also noted that some misleading media reports had occurred because scientists had not checked press releases for accuracy .
lord rees , the president of the royal society , said : " recent episodes such as the high-profile discrediting of papers on cloning are likely to bring the quality and reliability of all research under greater scrutiny .
" even when a result is firm , it is important to convey its impact fairly - neither over-hyping potential spin-offs nor exaggerating potential risks . "
bbc science correspondent pallab ghosh said the royal society 's report would raise concerns in some quarters that the advice it was giving to researchers could lead to a form of self-censorship and ultimately stifle scientific debate .

advocates of the exclusive domain had argued that it would make it easier for web users to locate - or avoid - pornography online .
conservative opponents of the plan said it would legitimise pornography , while opponents in the porn industry warned it could lead to more state control .
internet regulator icann 's chief said the decision was not political .
" the heart of the decision today was not driven by a political consideration , " paul twomey told the associated press news agency .
the idea for an .xxx domain was first floated in 2001 .
a final decision on approving the exclusive porn domain has been delayed several times - most recently in december .
in august , the decision was postponed following a request from the us department of commerce which had " concerns " about the domain .
plans for the .xxx have been criticised by many people and organisations , among them former icann board member karl auerbach and us conservative religious groups , including the family research council .
icm registry , the company that proposed and plans to run the .xxx , said the domain would have made it easier to find and filter pornographic material online .
critics said that because signing up for .xxx was voluntary , there was no guarantee pornographers would move material to the new domain , not least because many have established themselves on other well-known sites .

but at the nintendo stand at the e3 games expo , enthusiasts were eagerly queuing up to have a go at flicking their wrists or swinging their arms .
the reason was nintendo 's new games console , the wii , -lrb- pronounced we -rrb- , and its unorthodox way of play .
the japanese games giant has turned its back on the typical gamepad with a myriad of buttons and opted for using motion sensors .
the right-hand controller is shaped like a slim tv remote , while the left-hand one is rounded and curvy .
nintendo is giving people the chance to try out the controls for themselves at e3 , with 27 games for the wii available to play .
after having tried out a handful of these games , the initial results are surprisingly promising .
fore !
first off was tennis .
in this you use the right-hand remote as a racket , swinging it to hit the ball across the net .
it takes a couple of misses to connect your actions with the anime characters on the tv screen .
but within a few minutes , it was fairly easy to smash the ball and win matches .
the game also quickly revealed that it was not just a case of vague , random movements .
a rapid swing would increase the power of the shot .
and turning the controller at an angle would produce a top spin or slice .
another of the games on offer was golf .
here the device becomes the club and the force of a drive is determined by how far back you swing the controller .
again , the realism of the experience was impressive .
in particular , putting involved controlled strokes , determined by how much you moved the device .
point and shoot sports games like this lend themselves to physical controllers so the real test for the new controller would come with more conventional first-person shooters .
most fans of shooters prefer to play with a computer mouse and keyboard due to the degree of control this offers .
on the wii , the right-hand controller lets you point and shoot .
the left-hand holds the so-called nunchuck , which has a joystick for movement .
the unconventional set-up takes a while to get used to , especially as it is easy to wander off to one side of the screen by unwittingly moving the controller sideways .
but the point and shoot mechanism works well and adds a degree of realism .
whereas in other games reloading involves pressing a particular button , here a flick of the wrist is enough .
the swordplay was similarly intuitive - swing the right hand to strike and move the left hand to block .
positive impression the controls worked less well on another shooter , metroid prime 3 : corruption .
the principles were broadly the same , but some of the action also involved a number of button combinations .
over time , gamers will probably get used to this but it did not have the same pick and play appeal as the sports games .
of course , it is impossible to pass judgement on the wii remote after just playing each game for 10 minutes or so .
initially , it does feel a little strange to wave your arms around .
and the remote worked best with the sport titles .
but on first impressions , nintendo may have just produced a way of playing games that is fits the cliché - easy to play , hard to master .

delphi , which is chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , wants the court to grant it the right to annul labour contracts .
company boss kevin butler said that leaving contracts in place and having strikes in 2007 would be " far more devastating " than if it happened now .
unions said workers would be hit with large pay cuts if the contracts ended .
they also argued that worker representatives would be sidelined as the company planned for its future .
speeding up delphi is a former part of general motors and is still the carmaker 's largest supplier .
however , its earnings have suffered as increased competition and falling demand have eroded profits at gm .
to survive , delphi said it needed to reduce costs and proposed a plan that would cut 23,000 jobs , close 25 plants and cut benefits for staff and retirees .
it also complained that the unions had been slow to negotiate any form of compromise and as a result needed workers contracts terminated to give it greater freedom to move quickly and restore the business to health .
unions countered that it was the company that had slowed proceedings .
the current hearing is expected to last until friday , while a ruling could take months .
complicating matters is an agreement with gm , in which the former delphi owner has guaranteed the pensions and benefit obligations of workers should its supplier be unable to meet them .
gm has estimated that the guarantee could cost it between $ 5.5bn -lrb- £ 3bn -rrb- to $ 12bn .
delphi is keen to put its restructuring plan in place before the agreement expires because it expects negotiations to become more difficult once this safety net is removed .

but at the nintendo stand at the e3 games expo , enthusiasts were eagerly queuing up to have a go at flicking their wrists or swinging their arms .
the reason was nintendo 's new games console , the wii , -lrb- pronounced we -rrb- , and its unorthodox way of play .
the japanese games giant has turned its back on the typical gamepad with a myriad of buttons and opted for using motion sensors .
the right-hand controller is shaped like a slim tv remote , while the left-hand one is rounded and curvy .
nintendo is giving people the chance to try out the controls for themselves at e3 , with 27 games for the wii available to play .
after having tried out a handful of these games , the initial results are surprisingly promising .
fore !
first off was tennis .
in this you use the right-hand remote as a racket , swinging it to hit the ball across the net .
a playable level of metroid prime was available it takes a couple of misses to connect your actions with the anime characters on the tv screen .
but within a few minutes , it was fairly easy to smash the ball and win matches .
the game also quickly revealed that it was not just a case of vague , random movements .
a rapid swing would increase the power of the shot .
and turning the controller at an angle would produce a top spin or slice .
another of the games on offer was golf .
here the device becomes the club and the force of a drive is determined by how far back you swing the controller .
again , the realism of the experience was impressive .
in particular , putting involved controlled strokes , determined by how much you moved the device .
point and shoot sports games like this lend themselves to physical controllers so the real test for the new controller would come with more conventional first-person shooters .
the one on the left is the nunchuck most fans of shooters prefer to play with a computer mouse and keyboard due to the degree of control this offers .
on the wii , the right-hand controller lets you point and shoot .
the left-hand holds the so-called nunchuck , which has a joystick for movement .
the unconventional set-up takes a while to get used to , especially as it is easy to wander off to one side of the screen by unwittingly moving the controller sideways .
but the point and shoot mechanism works well and adds a degree of realism .
whereas in other games reloading involves pressing a particular button , here a flick of the wrist is enough .
the swordplay was similarly intuitive - swing the right hand to strike and move the left hand to block .
positive impression the controls worked less well on another shooter , metroid prime 3 : corruption .
the principles were broadly the same , but some of the action also involved a number of button combinations .
over time , gamers will probably get used to this but it did not have the same pick and play appeal as the sports games .
of course , it is impossible to pass judgement on the wii remote after just playing each game for 10 minutes or so .
initially , it does feel a little strange to wave your arms around .

nintendo is giving people the chance to try out the controls for themselves at e3 , with 27 games for the wii available to play .

fore !
first off was tennis .
in this you use the right-hand remote as a racket , swinging it to hit the ball across the net .
a playable level of metroid prime was available it takes a couple of misses to connect your actions with the anime characters on the tv screen .
but within a few minutes , it was fairly easy to smash the ball and win matches .
the game also quickly revealed that it was not just a case of vague , random movements .
a rapid swing would increase the power of the shot .
and turning the controller at an angle would produce a top spin or slice .
another of the games on offer was golf .
here the device becomes the club and the force of a drive is determined by how far back you swing the controller .
again , the realism of the experience was impressive .
in particular , putting involved controlled strokes , determined by how much you moved the device .
point and shoot sports games like this lend themselves to physical controllers so the real test for the new controller would come with more conventional first-person shooters .
the one on the left is the nunchuck most fans of shooters prefer to play with a computer mouse and keyboard due to the degree of control this offers .
on the wii , the right-hand controller lets you point and shoot .
the left-hand holds the so-called nunchuck , which has a joystick for movement .
the unconventional set-up takes a while to get used to , especially as it is easy to wander off to one side of the screen by unwittingly moving the controller sideways .
but the point and shoot mechanism works well and adds a degree of realism .
whereas in other games reloading involves pressing a particular button , here a flick of the wrist is enough .

rail company arriva organised six trips last august after a 14-year gap , attracting 2,500 passengers .
eighteen trips are planned this year over a month from the end of july on the cambrian coast line .
the steam service will run from machynlleth and aberystwyth to porthmadog and barmouth .
arriva said the steam service will run from 30 july and 28 august after a two-week period last summer .
the experience proved evocative and many people queued to catch a glimpse of the steam train as it pulled into stations along the route , said arriva .
west coast railway is laying on the steam train again this year which has been operating in scotland for more than a decade .
' railway enthusiasts ' sights along the line include the white sands of the mawddach estuary and the barmouth bridge , harlech and criccieth castles and snowdonia mountains .
graeme bunker , managing director of arriva trains wales , said : " customers told us last year that you just ca n't beat the scenery when travelling by steam engine - even those who travel the line regularly .
" i am sure the month-long steam services will draw a large number of visitors and railway enthusiasts to the cambrian coast , many of whom might be visiting wales for the first time - but not the last . "
services from machynlleth to porthmadog will run on mondays , wednesdays and thursdays with services from aberystwyth to barmouth running on sundays .

laura mcgillivray , chief executive of norwich city council , said : " we each have urban areas with pockets of deprivation which have very different needs from our surrounding county rural areas .
" we are the local authorities that can best respond to these particular community needs , yet we are constrained by the two-tier system imposed in 1974 . "

senior sony executive phil harrison said the models were aimed at different types of consumers .
the games giant has been criticised for offering a lower end model without several significant features .
the console is due to go on sale in november , with prices starting at $ 499 in the us and 499 euros -lrb- £ 341 -rrb- in europe .
hd concerns sony announced the launch date and price for the ps3 at a big news presentation at its studios in culver city in los angeles .
at the time it only talked about the difference in the size of the hard drives .
the basic model has a 20gb drive , while the model costing $ 599/599 euros comes with a 60gb one .
only later , after detailed press releases were distributed , did it become apparent that there were other key differences .
we have a great brand and fantastically loyal consumers phil harrison , sony the lower end model lacks wi-fi , a slot for memory cards and , in particular , a port to hook up a hdmi lead for high-definition programmes .
the decision to offer a model without hdmi has raised concerns about the high-definition compatibility of the ps3 .
mr harrison shrugged off these fears , insisting that the both models would offer full hd output .
" what we should be clear about is that the functionality is identical in both machines , " he told the bbc news website .
" there is no difference in what the machine does . "
" it 's just that the technical method of extracting audio and video from the devices is slightly different , " said mr harrison , who heads up sony computer entertainment worldwide studios .
he said the decision to offer two versions was designed to give consumers a choice .
" some people might be interested in the ps3 primarily and exclusively as a games system , whereas other users might look at it as a multimedia hub in the home , which is games and music and movies and other digital content . "
xbox rivals speaking personally , mr harrison said he would buy the high end model .
it seems likely that playstation fans looking forward to the new system may do the same thing .
some queued for an hour to see the new games when rival microsoft launched its xbox 360 console last november , it offered a basic model and a higher-end model .
but gamers shied away from the cheaper version in favour of the more expensive one .
microsoft has sold more than three million xbox 360s worldwide since its debut .
it has set itself a target of 10 million by the time the ps3 appears in stores in an attempt to steal a lead over sony .
but mr harrison said he was not worried by the figures from microsoft .
" i doubt they will achieve that , " he said " i think the clear advantages of the ps3 will mean that this product is very well accepted in the marketplace .
" we have a great brand and fantastically loyal consumers . "
japanese gamers will be the first to get their hands on the ps3 on 11 november .
the console will arrive in the us and europe on 17 november .
pressed on whether sony would meet this deadline , mr harrison said the company would not have specified a date unless it could , adding that manufacturing of the console was starting .

only later , after detailed press releases were distributed , did it become apparent that there were other key differences .
we have a great brand and fantastically loyal consumers phil harrison , sony the lower end model lacks wi-fi , a slot for memory cards and , in particular , a port to hook up a hdmi lead for high-definition programmes .
the decision to offer a model without hdmi has raised concerns about the high-definition compatibility of the ps3 .
mr harrison shrugged off these fears , insisting that the both models would offer full hd output .
" what we should be clear about is that the functionality is identical in both machines , " he told the bbc news website .
" there is no difference in what the machine does . "
" it 's just that the technical method of extracting audio and video from the devices is slightly different , " said mr harrison , who heads up sony computer entertainment worldwide studios .
he said the decision to offer two versions was designed to give consumers a choice .
" some people might be interested in the ps3 primarily and exclusively as a games system , whereas other users might look at it as a multimedia hub in the home , which is games and music and movies and other digital content . "
xbox rivals speaking personally , mr harrison said he would buy the high end model .
it seems likely that playstation fans looking forward to the new system may do the same thing .
some queued for an hour to see the new games when rival microsoft launched its xbox 360 console last november , it offered a basic model and a higher-end model .
but gamers shied away from the cheaper version in favour of the more expensive one .
microsoft has sold more than three million xbox 360s worldwide since its debut .
it has set itself a target of 10 million by the time the ps3 appears in stores in an attempt to steal a lead over sony .
but mr harrison said he was not worried by the figures from microsoft .
" i doubt they will achieve that , " he said " i think the clear advantages of the ps3 will mean that this product is very well accepted in the marketplace .
" we have a great brand and fantastically loyal consumers . "
japanese gamers will be the first to get their hands on the ps3 on 11 november .
the console will arrive in the us and europe on 17 november .

" the need for a co-ordinated and forceful international response to the andijan massacre is more urgent than ever , " said the us human rights group .
although details remain unclear , it is thought hundreds of people may have been killed on 13 may last year .

audit scotland 's review of the mccrone agreement found it had brought improved industrial relations , better teacher recruitment and retention .
however , it said headteachers ' workload had increased since the 2001 agreement .
education minister peter peacock and cosla said teachers were happier , but the snp cited a " lack of focus " .

" new teachers now benefit from the support and structure offered by the world leading teacher induction scheme , " mr peacock added .
the minister said he would consider audit scotland 's report in detail and consider how its recommendations could be used to improve the sector .
cosla 's education spokesperson ewan aitken said the teachers ' agreement had brought lasting benefits to everyone within the education sector .
" scotland 's school children now have teachers who can concentrate on educating as a result of the recruitment of administrative and support staff to take on the non-teaching tasks , " he said .

" it allowed us to move on from a period of very poor industrial relations , peppered with strike threats , and to give greater respect and recognition to teachers in our society . "
the minister said a four-year pay deal signed in 2004 gave teachers more stability and signalled an end to the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s .
peter peacock hailed morale within the teaching profession " new teachers now benefit from the support and structure offered by the world leading teacher induction scheme , " mr peacock added .
the minister said he would consider audit scotland 's report in detail and consider how its recommendations could be used to improve the sector .
cosla 's education spokesperson ewan aitken said the teachers ' agreement had brought lasting benefits to everyone within the education sector .
" scotland 's school children now have teachers who can concentrate on educating as a result of the recruitment of administrative and support staff to take on the non-teaching tasks , " he said .

if passed , the bill will allow terminally ill adults in unbearable pain to receive medical help in dying .
many objections to physician-assisted suicide are based on religious prohibitions .
these can only be countered by refuting the religion itself - a notoriously hard thing to do - or by arguing that religious teaching actually permits the act .
i shall not employ either of these arguments . "
harm is , at least in part , a subjective notion " religion-based reasons will not persuade the secular folk , and hence many objectors usually replace or supplement their arguments with non-religious reasons .
some of the secular reasons against physician-assisted suicide -lrb- pas -rrb- appear speculative or ill-informed .
initial doubts they remind the historically aware of the initial reactions surrounding practices which are now widely accepted -lrb- for example , human dissection , considered an affront to human dignity in hippocratic times , and vaccination , considered unnatural and a thwarting of god 's will in the 19th and 20th centuries -rrb- .
some reasons , however , are more convincing .
have your say " if we allow assisted suicide of any sort , we undermine the value of life itself " am costley , carmarthen , wales send us your comments one such reason is that pas will change the way members of the public view doctors .
in the public 's mind , doctors will become part-time executioners .
we can not predict if this will occur , but even if it did at first adversely affect the public 's perspective , it is not a sufficient reason to reject the bill .
people 's views can , and do , change .
if physician-assisted suicide is morally acceptable , then the fact that people might frown upon it does not alter the morality of the act .
hippocratic oath another common argument about pas , especially amongst doctors , is that it violates the hippocratic dictum : ' first , do no harm ' . "
if we strictly adhered to hippocratic teachings , abortion should also be abolished " this principle was insightful in hippocratic times when doctors mostly did more harm than good - magic and superstition were rife , and efficacious treatments few - but not in this scientific age .
the oath is now out of date .
if we strictly adhered to hippocratic teachings , abortion should also be abolished , for the oath says " neither will i give a woman means to procure an abortion " .
it is therefore wrong slavishly to revere - as some still do - the hippocratic oath .
if taken literally , the only way doctors could ' do no harm ' would be by declining to treat all patients .
even simple medical procedures , such as taking a blood sample or injecting a local anaesthetic , entail some risks to the patient .
many procedures and treatments require doctors to inflict harm in order to bring about some good .
in an appendectomy , the surgeon cuts open the patient 's abdomen -lrb- a harm -rrb- to remove the troublesome appendix -lrb- a benefit -rrb- .
balance of good as the ethicist professor raanan gillon points out , doctors have a duty not to cause net harm . "
in my view , physician-assisted suicide can be compatible with love , kindness and compassion " is pas a net harm to the patient who wants it ?
those in favour of the act will argue that helping a terminally ill patient to die is a benefit , not a harm .
harm is , at least in part , a subjective notion .
what is beneficial or harmful to a particular patient is determined to some extent by the patient 's perception .
if i choose to donate a kidney to my sick brother , no one would rightfully accuse the surgeon of having harmed me by removing the organ .
overall , the operation would benefit me in spite of the physical harm .
respecting a patient 's autonomous wishes can itself constitute a benefit .
thus it is far from clear that allowing doctors to help patients end their lives infringes the dictum ' first , do no -lrb- net -rrb- harm ' .
an answer to the morality of pas can be found by reflecting on the essence of medicine .
this is no easy task .
paracelsus , in the 16th century , wrote that medicine was grounded in love .
more recently , sir william osler stressed the importance of humanity , which consists in showing ' tenderness and consideration to the weak , infinite pity to the suffering , and broad charity to all ' .
he reminded doctors to keep a ' clear head and a kind heart ' .
when the late jean bernard , the distinguished french haematologist , was asked by a journalist a few years ago : " technology aside , on what is medicine based ? " , he replied " on love , on compassion , since medicine will always be about man " .
in my view , physician-assisted suicide can be compatible with love , kindness and compassion .
the real difficulties lie in regulating the practice to limit the possibility of abuse and , once that is overcome , in summing up the courage to do what is morally right in the face of anticipated abuse and opposition .

those in favour of the act will argue that helping a terminally ill patient to die is a benefit , not a harm .
harm is , at least in part , a subjective notion .
what is beneficial or harmful to a particular patient is determined to some extent by the patient 's perception .
if i choose to donate a kidney to my sick brother , no one would rightfully accuse the surgeon of having harmed me by removing the organ .
overall , the operation would benefit me in spite of the physical harm .
respecting a patient 's autonomous wishes can itself constitute a benefit .
thus it is far from clear that allowing doctors to help patients end their lives infringes the dictum ' first , do no -lrb- net -rrb- harm ' .
an answer to the morality of pas can be found by reflecting on the essence of medicine .
this is no easy task .
paracelsus , in the 16th century , wrote that medicine was grounded in love .
more recently , sir william osler stressed the importance of humanity , which consists in showing ' tenderness and consideration to the weak , infinite pity to the suffering , and broad charity to all ' .
he reminded doctors to keep a ' clear head and a kind heart ' .
when the late jean bernard , the distinguished french haematologist , was asked by a journalist a few years ago : " technology aside , on what is medicine based ? " , he replied " on love , on compassion , since medicine will always be about man " .
in my view , physician-assisted suicide can be compatible with love , kindness and compassion .
the real difficulties lie in regulating the practice to limit the possibility of abuse and , once that is overcome , in summing up the courage to do what is morally right in the face of anticipated abuse and opposition .
