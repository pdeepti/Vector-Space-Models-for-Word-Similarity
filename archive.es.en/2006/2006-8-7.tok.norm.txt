the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .
on the other hand , it 's also our responsibility to criticize the foreign policy of the german government where it 's wrongly used .
that 's why i said that the german government should n't get entangled too deeply in the bush administration 's workings when it comes to its political efforts .
after all , the bush administration has largely squandered its goodwill and reputation in the middle east and the arab world . naser shrouf interviewed oskar lafontaine -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still reticent about involvement in mideast mission they may not have rejected outright israeli leader olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east , but german politicians harbor deep reservations about the controversial proposal .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .

" we must take into consideration everyone 's concerns , while keeping the text 's logic . " leba n o n rejects resolutio n the passing of the resolution floundered after qatar , the only arab member of the council , and lebanon voiced their unhappiness with the text and demanded modifications .
both russia and china argued in favor of making the text more attractive to lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli army convoy next to the border with lebanon , in northern israel the chief hurdle is the presence of some 10,000 israeli troops in southern lebanon .
the draft does not call for their withdrawal , which would be left to a follow-up resolution authorizing an international force and setting peace terms . lebanese foreign ministry official nouhad mahmoud told reuters that the current text was " not implementable . " " definitely the intention of those who are working on it is the intention for peace , and that 's why we are telling them that its not adequate that it does not really achieve the objective that they 've set for themselves , " said lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . syrian foreign minister walid muallem also said the un draft resolution to end the conflict was " a recipe for the continuation of war . " the draft resolution - favored by israel and the us - does however call for a " full cessation of hostilities " and says hezbollah must stop all attacks while israel must halt " offensive military operations . "
it also calls on un peacekeepers to monitor the truce and stipulates principles necessary for a permanent political settlement . merkel : resolutio n a n " importa n t step " despite misgivings in the arab world about the us-french draft resolution , leaders elsewhere in europe have welcomed it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has hailed the resolution german chancellor angela merkel called it " an important step towards a halt in military operations . "
merkel stressed the resolution contained the right message . " the accord on a resolution for the middle east is a strong signal by the international community to the parties involved in the conflict , " merkel was quoted by a government spokesman as saying . olmert : " do n ' t preach to us " even as the german government mulls the possibility of sending german peacekeepers to the middle east after an explicit statement to that effect by israeli prime minister ehud olmert in a newspaper interview , the israeli leader took a swipe at european leaders ' heightening concerns about mounting civilian losses in lebanon as a result of israeli strikes . in an interview published sunday in german newspaper welt am so n n tag , olmert told european leaders to stop preaching to him about civilian war casualties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert says europeans have no right to preach to israel " where do they get the right to preach to israel ? "
olmert said .
" european countries attacked kosovo and killed 10,000 civilians .
ten thousand !
and none of these countries had to suffer before that from a single rocket , " he said .
" i 'm not saying it was wrong to intervene in kosovo .
but please : do n't preach to us about the treatment of civilians . " meanwhile , there was no letup in the violence which has killed over 770 people in lebanon , mostly civilians , and over 90 israelis .

while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad . " competing farmers in poland , italy , and the czech republic are at an advantage over their german competitors as they receive twice as much in government subsidies .
but in a bid to remain competitive and to keep german stores stocked with organic produce grown in germany , the farmers are facing another dilemma . problems converting to meet demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes three years for a conventional farm to be fully switch to organic the regulations in the organic farming sector concerning growth agents and agricultural techniques are so strict , and the time and costs involved in cultivating bio-produce so demanding , that german farmers find themselves unable to meet the rising demand .
and for conventional farmers looking to convert to organic farming in a bid to profit from that demand , there are also problems . the switch to organic is a costly one for conventional farmers .
a farm beginning to produce organically grown food can expect to earn 60 percent less in revenue at the start of its new business . " the change from conventional to organic farming does not happen overnight , " said achim spiller , professor for agrarian marketing at the university of göttingen .
" it takes at least three years of conforming to organic guidelines until a farmer can sell produce under the ' bio ' label . " foreign competition adding pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition from latin america is adding to the pressure with the discounters slashing the prices of organic products and foreign growers increasing competition , the consumers are looking like the winners of germany 's " bio-boom " while german farmers are almost certainly on the losing side . " in eastern europe and latin america , there is a focus on producing organic food and the industry is strongly promoted by governments , " spiller said .
" many third world countries also use organic cultivation as they have had little access to fertilizer and pesticides in the past . " hermann heldberg , a health food wholesaler for over 30 years , is just one of a growing number of people in the organic food industry who are calling for the german government to help farmers . " we are behind the likes of the netherlands in producing organic vegetables , " he said .
" it is heavily promoted there and if a dutch firm wants to expand and export its goods to germany , then there is a big market here for them .
but we also can produce cucumbers and peppers .

i would be very happy if germany participated , " olmert told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g last week .
" i have informed chancellor angela merkel that we have absolutely no problem having german troops in south lebanon . " the israeli leader may have no problem , but germany certainly does . ever since the publication of olmert 's interview , the country is witnessing an intense domestic debate about the rights and wrongs of such a move . the german government has not entirely ruled out sending troops to the middle east . though chancellor angela merkel has rejected any immediate deployment of troops , defense minister franz josef jung said last month that if both sides in the conflict and the international community requested german participation , it would be difficult for berlin to decline . " difficult shared history " but , many citizens and politicians remain uneasy about sending soldiers to the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagoge in leipzig - some 110,000 jews live in germany today foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said last month that talks about germany 's involvement in a possible international peacekeeping force on the israeli-lebanon border were being treated with great sensitivity . " i think this is appropriate given the difficult shared history between germany and israel , " he told german broadcaster zdf . few doubt that more than 60 years after world war ii and the holocaust , in which the nazis killed about six million jews , sending german soldiers to the region would be far from controversial . deputy foreign minister gernot erler of the social democratic party ruled out a direct military involvement by german troops " for purely historical reasons . " in an interview with german daily die welt on saturday , erler said german troops could possibly be involved in reconstruction and training the lebanese army and police , but not in firing on israeli troops , if necessary , given germany 's persecution of europe 's jews during its nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli soldier smokes a cigarette at an artillery position near the lebanese border " it 's difficult to imagine german soldiers armed with guns facing off against israelis , " erler said . co n cer n s about n eutrality others have voiced concern that olmert 's explicit mention of a german role in the future peacekeeping mission would work to the country 's disadvantage and would make it make it difficult for germany to stay neutral .
germany will be seen as " partisan " in the eyes of the arab world , said oskar lafontaine of the opposition left party . some have criticized olmert 's statement that an international peacekeeping force would , above all , serve to protect israel from further attacks by the shiite militant group hezbollah instead of securing stability in lebanon after a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . " a peacekeeping force is no ' pro israel ' force , but rather it 's meant to be neutral , " birgit homburger , a defense expert of the opposition free-market liberals , fdp , told news agency reuters . on a more pragmatic note , some german politicians have emphasized that germany 's armed forces are already overstretched with peacekeeping deployments as far away as congo and afghanistan and simply lack the resources to participate in the middle east . " first facts , the n decisio n " though there is almost unanimous agreement that it 's too premature to talk of german participation given the fact that there 's still no un mandate or framework for an international peacekeeping force in the middle east , some believe that olmert 's frank talk may have opened up much-needed debate on what has long been considered taboo . olmert 's wish does show " that all those who have categorically ruled out german participation on historical grounds and thus seized control from us on how to formulate a mandate -lrb- for the peacekeeping force -rrb- have been wrong , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told news agency reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fierce fighting still continues on the israeli-lebanon border foreign minister steinmeier called olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east as a " noteworthy proof of trust " and one which made apparent " the extraordinarily good development between israel and germany in the past decades . " but , first the mandate , scope and composition of the international peacekeeping force has to be clarified , steinmeier added : " first the facts , then the decision .

but german farmers are losing out due to an inability to meet rising demand . with organic products increasing in popularity across the board despite being more expensive , one might think that organic farmers are raking in the profits . but just as " bio-food " takes off in germany 's many discount food chains , farmers are taking a financial hit from the no-frills segment , which is cutting the price of organic produce in line with the rest of the cheap items on offer . for german organic farmers , seeing their eco-friendly products , laboriously grown with care and conscience , on the shelves of discount supermarkets is a bitter pill to swallow .
while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad .

" we must take into consideration everyone 's concerns , while keeping the text 's logic . " leba n o n rejects resolutio n the passing of the resolution floundered after qatar , the only arab member of the council , and lebanon voiced their unhappiness with the text and demanded modifications .
both russia and china argued in favor of making the text more attractive to lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli army convoy next to the border with lebanon , in northern israel the chief hurdle is the presence of some 10,000 israeli troops in southern lebanon .
the draft does not call for their withdrawal , which would be left to a follow-up resolution authorizing an international force and setting peace terms . lebanese foreign ministry official nouhad mahmoud told reuters that the current text was " not implementable . " " definitely the intention of those who are working on it is the intention for peace , and that 's why we are telling them that its not adequate that it does not really achieve the objective that they 've set for themselves , " said lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . syrian foreign minister walid muallem also said the un draft resolution to end the conflict was " a recipe for the continuation of war . " the draft resolution - favored by israel and the us - does however call for a " full cessation of hostilities " and says hezbollah must stop all attacks while israel must halt " offensive military operations . "
it also calls on un peacekeepers to monitor the truce and stipulates principles necessary for a permanent political settlement . merkel : resolutio n a n " importa n t step " despite misgivings in the arab world about the us-french draft resolution , leaders elsewhere in europe have welcomed it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has hailed the resolution german chancellor angela merkel called it " an important step towards a halt in military operations . "
merkel stressed the resolution contained the right message . " the accord on a resolution for the middle east is a strong signal by the international community to the parties involved in the conflict , " merkel was quoted by a government spokesman as saying . olmert : " do n ' t preach to us " even as the german government mulls the possibility of sending german peacekeepers to the middle east after an explicit statement to that effect by israeli prime minister ehud olmert in a newspaper interview , the israeli leader took a swipe at european leaders ' heightening concerns about mounting civilian losses in lebanon as a result of israeli strikes . in an interview published sunday in german newspaper welt am so n n tag , olmert told european leaders to stop preaching to him about civilian war casualties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert says europeans have no right to preach to israel " where do they get the right to preach to israel ? "
olmert said .
" european countries attacked kosovo and killed 10,000 civilians .
ten thousand !
and none of these countries had to suffer before that from a single rocket , " he said .
" i 'm not saying it was wrong to intervene in kosovo .
but please : do n't preach to us about the treatment of civilians . " meanwhile , there was no letup in the violence which has killed over 770 people in lebanon , mostly civilians , and over 90 israelis .

" our activities respect the non-proliferation treaty ... so we will not accept the suspension -lrb- of uranium enrichment -rrb- , " nuclear chief ali larijani told a news conference , in the first formal reaction to the july 31 resolution .
" they should know that such resolutions will not affect our determination .
we will pursue the nuclear rights of iranians which are enshrined in the npt . " the un security council resolution requires iran to halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive nuclear fuel work by august 31 or face the prospect of sanctions . " this resolution has no legal credibility and it negates the purpose of the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency , " larijani said . the resolution was pushed through after iran ignored a previous non-binding deadline and failed to respond to an international offer of a package of incentives in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear fuel work . iran , opec 's second largest oil exporter , insists it wants to enrich uranium only to make reactor fuel for power stations , but there is widespread suspicion the country wants the capacity to make weapons-grade uranium . ira n war n s of oil " weapo n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could turn off its considerable oil supply larijani warned world powers against imposing sanctions , suggesting that iran could use oil as a weapon . " it will have a huge international impact , " he said .
" they will lose more than us .
they should not do something that will leave them shivering in winter . " larijani also said iran could expand its nuclear activities by increasing the cascade of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment . in april , iran said it had successfully enriched uranium to 3.5 percent using 164 centrifuges .
it also plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at its enrichment plant in natanz , in central iran , by the end of the iranian year in march 2007 . to reach weapons-grade material , the enrichment level has to reach more than 90 percent . i n ce n tive package still o n the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's un ambassador javad zarif was not happy larijani , however , said iran was still studying the package of incentives offered by britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states on june 6 , saying it " had the potential to resolve the nuclear issues . " the package , handed to tehran on june 6 , offers trade , technology , diplomatic and other incentives as well as multilateral talks - also involving the united states - if iran agrees to freeze enrichment . larijani said iran would respond to the offer by aug .
22 , but that the un resolution had " badly affected the opportunity -lrb- represented by the offer -rrb- and our attitude . " " the question is not what iran 's response will be , but to create an atmosphere to pursue the process -lrb- of negotiations -rrb- , " he said .
" the proposal has positive points as well as ambiguities .
negotiations must be constructive and away from pressure , to enable the ambiguities to be removed . " even if they -lrb- the un security council members -rrb- have any reasons to -lrb- demand -rrb- suspension of enrichment they should address them in negotiation , " he added .
" but they can not prescribe it before talks . " the security council has charged iaea chief mohammed elbaradei with reporting back on iranian compliance . if it does not comply , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures " under article 41 of chapter 7 of the un charter , which relates to economic sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .
on the other hand , it 's also our responsibility to criticize the foreign policy of the german government where it 's wrongly used .
that 's why i said that the german government should n't get entangled too deeply in the bush administration 's workings when it comes to its political efforts .
after all , the bush administration has largely squandered its goodwill and reputation in the middle east and the arab world . naser shrouf interviewed oskar lafontaine -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still reticent about involvement in mideast mission they may not have rejected outright israeli leader olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east , but german politicians harbor deep reservations about the controversial proposal .

7 , 2006 -rrb- un fails to agree on mideast ceasefire a swift end to the middle east crisis looked out of reach monday as the un failed to agree on a draft resolution to halt fighting and israeli prime minister olmert told european leaders to stop preaching to israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.08.2006 iran set to defy un resolution by pursuing further enrichment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani said tehran will not accept the un 's terms in defiance of a un resolution , iran has insisted it will not freeze uranium enrichment and warned it could even expand its nuclear program , which the west fears is a cover for efforts to build the bomb . " our activities respect the non-proliferation treaty ... so we will not accept the suspension -lrb- of uranium enrichment -rrb- , " nuclear chief ali larijani told a news conference , in the first formal reaction to the july 31 resolution .
" they should know that such resolutions will not affect our determination .
we will pursue the nuclear rights of iranians which are enshrined in the npt . " the un security council resolution requires iran to halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive nuclear fuel work by august 31 or face the prospect of sanctions . " this resolution has no legal credibility and it negates the purpose of the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency , " larijani said . the resolution was pushed through after iran ignored a previous non-binding deadline and failed to respond to an international offer of a package of incentives in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear fuel work . iran , opec 's second largest oil exporter , insists it wants to enrich uranium only to make reactor fuel for power stations , but there is widespread suspicion the country wants the capacity to make weapons-grade uranium . ira n war n s of oil " weapo n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could turn off its considerable oil supply larijani warned world powers against imposing sanctions , suggesting that iran could use oil as a weapon . " it will have a huge international impact , " he said .
" they will lose more than us .
they should not do something that will leave them shivering in winter . " larijani also said iran could expand its nuclear activities by increasing the cascade of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment . in april , iran said it had successfully enriched uranium to 3.5 percent using 164 centrifuges .
it also plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at its enrichment plant in natanz , in central iran , by the end of the iranian year in march 2007 . to reach weapons-grade material , the enrichment level has to reach more than 90 percent . i n ce n tive package still o n the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's un ambassador javad zarif was not happy larijani , however , said iran was still studying the package of incentives offered by britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states on june 6 , saying it " had the potential to resolve the nuclear issues . " the package , handed to tehran on june 6 , offers trade , technology , diplomatic and other incentives as well as multilateral talks - also involving the united states - if iran agrees to freeze enrichment . larijani said iran would respond to the offer by aug .
22 , but that the un resolution had " badly affected the opportunity -lrb- represented by the offer -rrb- and our attitude . " " the question is not what iran 's response will be , but to create an atmosphere to pursue the process -lrb- of negotiations -rrb- , " he said .
" the proposal has positive points as well as ambiguities .
negotiations must be constructive and away from pressure , to enable the ambiguities to be removed . " even if they -lrb- the un security council members -rrb- have any reasons to -lrb- demand -rrb- suspension of enrichment they should address them in negotiation , " he added .
" but they can not prescribe it before talks . " the security council has charged iaea chief mohammed elbaradei with reporting back on iranian compliance . if it does not comply , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures " under article 41 of chapter 7 of the un charter , which relates to economic sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program .

" our activities respect the non-proliferation treaty ... so we will not accept the suspension -lrb- of uranium enrichment -rrb- , " nuclear chief ali larijani told a news conference , in the first formal reaction to the july 31 resolution .
" they should know that such resolutions will not affect our determination .
we will pursue the nuclear rights of iranians which are enshrined in the npt . " the un security council resolution requires iran to halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive nuclear fuel work by august 31 or face the prospect of sanctions . " this resolution has no legal credibility and it negates the purpose of the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency , " larijani said . the resolution was pushed through after iran ignored a previous non-binding deadline and failed to respond to an international offer of a package of incentives in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear fuel work . iran , opec 's second largest oil exporter , insists it wants to enrich uranium only to make reactor fuel for power stations , but there is widespread suspicion the country wants the capacity to make weapons-grade uranium . ira n war n s of oil " weapo n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could turn off its considerable oil supply larijani warned world powers against imposing sanctions , suggesting that iran could use oil as a weapon . " it will have a huge international impact , " he said .
" they will lose more than us .
they should not do something that will leave them shivering in winter . " larijani also said iran could expand its nuclear activities by increasing the cascade of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment . in april , iran said it had successfully enriched uranium to 3.5 percent using 164 centrifuges .
it also plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at its enrichment plant in natanz , in central iran , by the end of the iranian year in march 2007 . to reach weapons-grade material , the enrichment level has to reach more than 90 percent . i n ce n tive package still o n the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's un ambassador javad zarif was not happy larijani , however , said iran was still studying the package of incentives offered by britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states on june 6 , saying it " had the potential to resolve the nuclear issues . " the package , handed to tehran on june 6 , offers trade , technology , diplomatic and other incentives as well as multilateral talks - also involving the united states - if iran agrees to freeze enrichment . larijani said iran would respond to the offer by aug .
22 , but that the un resolution had " badly affected the opportunity -lrb- represented by the offer -rrb- and our attitude . " " the question is not what iran 's response will be , but to create an atmosphere to pursue the process -lrb- of negotiations -rrb- , " he said .
" the proposal has positive points as well as ambiguities .
negotiations must be constructive and away from pressure , to enable the ambiguities to be removed . " even if they -lrb- the un security council members -rrb- have any reasons to -lrb- demand -rrb- suspension of enrichment they should address them in negotiation , " he added .
" but they can not prescribe it before talks . " the security council has charged iaea chief mohammed elbaradei with reporting back on iranian compliance . if it does not comply , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures " under article 41 of chapter 7 of the un charter , which relates to economic sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program .

i would be very happy if germany participated , " olmert told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g last week .
" i have informed chancellor angela merkel that we have absolutely no problem having german troops in south lebanon . " the israeli leader may have no problem , but germany certainly does . ever since the publication of olmert 's interview , the country is witnessing an intense domestic debate about the rights and wrongs of such a move . the german government has not entirely ruled out sending troops to the middle east . though chancellor angela merkel has rejected any immediate deployment of troops , defense minister franz josef jung said last month that if both sides in the conflict and the international community requested german participation , it would be difficult for berlin to decline . " difficult shared history " but , many citizens and politicians remain uneasy about sending soldiers to the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagoge in leipzig - some 110,000 jews live in germany today foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said last month that talks about germany 's involvement in a possible international peacekeeping force on the israeli-lebanon border were being treated with great sensitivity . " i think this is appropriate given the difficult shared history between germany and israel , " he told german broadcaster zdf . few doubt that more than 60 years after world war ii and the holocaust , in which the nazis killed about six million jews , sending german soldiers to the region would be far from controversial . deputy foreign minister gernot erler of the social democratic party ruled out a direct military involvement by german troops " for purely historical reasons . " in an interview with german daily die welt on saturday , erler said german troops could possibly be involved in reconstruction and training the lebanese army and police , but not in firing on israeli troops , if necessary , given germany 's persecution of europe 's jews during its nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli soldier smokes a cigarette at an artillery position near the lebanese border " it 's difficult to imagine german soldiers armed with guns facing off against israelis , " erler said . co n cer n s about n eutrality others have voiced concern that olmert 's explicit mention of a german role in the future peacekeeping mission would work to the country 's disadvantage and would make it make it difficult for germany to stay neutral .
germany will be seen as " partisan " in the eyes of the arab world , said oskar lafontaine of the opposition left party . some have criticized olmert 's statement that an international peacekeeping force would , above all , serve to protect israel from further attacks by the shiite militant group hezbollah instead of securing stability in lebanon after a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . " a peacekeeping force is no ' pro israel ' force , but rather it 's meant to be neutral , " birgit homburger , a defense expert of the opposition free-market liberals , fdp , told news agency reuters . on a more pragmatic note , some german politicians have emphasized that germany 's armed forces are already overstretched with peacekeeping deployments as far away as congo and afghanistan and simply lack the resources to participate in the middle east . " first facts , the n decisio n " though there is almost unanimous agreement that it 's too premature to talk of german participation given the fact that there 's still no un mandate or framework for an international peacekeeping force in the middle east , some believe that olmert 's frank talk may have opened up much-needed debate on what has long been considered taboo . olmert 's wish does show " that all those who have categorically ruled out german participation on historical grounds and thus seized control from us on how to formulate a mandate -lrb- for the peacekeeping force -rrb- have been wrong , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told news agency reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fierce fighting still continues on the israeli-lebanon border foreign minister steinmeier called olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east as a " noteworthy proof of trust " and one which made apparent " the extraordinarily good development between israel and germany in the past decades . " but , first the mandate , scope and composition of the international peacekeeping force has to be clarified , steinmeier added : " first the facts , then the decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.08.2006 farmers losing out in german organic boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic farmers in germany ca n't grow enough to meet demand the demand for organic produce in germany has never been higher , now that discount supermarkets are also offering cheaper organic produce .
but german farmers are losing out due to an inability to meet rising demand . with organic products increasing in popularity across the board despite being more expensive , one might think that organic farmers are raking in the profits . but just as " bio-food " takes off in germany 's many discount food chains , farmers are taking a financial hit from the no-frills segment , which is cutting the price of organic produce in line with the rest of the cheap items on offer . for german organic farmers , seeing their eco-friendly products , laboriously grown with care and conscience , on the shelves of discount supermarkets is a bitter pill to swallow .
while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad . " competing farmers in poland , italy , and the czech republic are at an advantage over their german competitors as they receive twice as much in government subsidies .
but in a bid to remain competitive and to keep german stores stocked with organic produce grown in germany , the farmers are facing another dilemma . problems converting to meet demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes three years for a conventional farm to be fully switch to organic the regulations in the organic farming sector concerning growth agents and agricultural techniques are so strict , and the time and costs involved in cultivating bio-produce so demanding , that german farmers find themselves unable to meet the rising demand .
and for conventional farmers looking to convert to organic farming in a bid to profit from that demand , there are also problems . the switch to organic is a costly one for conventional farmers .
a farm beginning to produce organically grown food can expect to earn 60 percent less in revenue at the start of its new business . " the change from conventional to organic farming does not happen overnight , " said achim spiller , professor for agrarian marketing at the university of göttingen .
" it takes at least three years of conforming to organic guidelines until a farmer can sell produce under the ' bio ' label . " foreign competition adding pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition from latin america is adding to the pressure with the discounters slashing the prices of organic products and foreign growers increasing competition , the consumers are looking like the winners of germany 's " bio-boom " while german farmers are almost certainly on the losing side . " in eastern europe and latin america , there is a focus on producing organic food and the industry is strongly promoted by governments , " spiller said .
" many third world countries also use organic cultivation as they have had little access to fertilizer and pesticides in the past . " hermann heldberg , a health food wholesaler for over 30 years , is just one of a growing number of people in the organic food industry who are calling for the german government to help farmers . " we are behind the likes of the netherlands in producing organic vegetables , " he said .
" it is heavily promoted there and if a dutch firm wants to expand and export its goods to germany , then there is a big market here for them .
but we also can produce cucumbers and peppers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.08.2006 eu proposes new rules to simplify cross-border divorces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what happens if it the fairytale does n't last ?
each year , thousands of international couples file for divorce in the eu – a complicated affair as there are no clear rules on which national laws apply to their divorce .
now , the eu is aiming to simplify matters . with more freedom of movement within the european union have come more cross-border marriages .
but not all of these marriages last a lifetime .
each year , up to 170,000 international couples file for divorce in the eu – representing 16 percent of all separations in europe .
in addition to their personal problems , the divorcing couple is also confronted with a myriad of practical and legal problems exacerbated by the lack of any common eu family law . there are many widely varying legal systems and divorce procedures in the eu 's member states .
in ireland , for example , couples must have a four-year separation period before they can divorce , whereas in finland , a divorce can be obtained in six months .
at present , it is often difficult for international couples – where spouses are either of different nationalities , live in different member states , or have the same nationality but live in a member state other than their state of origin – to know which laws apply to their divorce . additionally , the current situation can lead to " divorce shopping " where one spouse will " rush to court , " said david davidson , head of the family department at leading london law firm charles russell . " due to the enormous difference in the financial relief given to spouses in different eu jurisdictions , inevitably , you ’ re going to have situations where husbands will try to file where wives get less , and wives try to file where wives get more , " davidson said . " one of the consequences of this is that when a marriage hits rocks , rather than sitting down and talking through their problems and seeking to reconcile or deal with things in an amicable fashion , the couple are compelled by these rules to fire the gun as it were , and start the process of dissolution of marriage in order to achieve a tactical advantage . " stopping " divorce shopping " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for justice , freedom and security franco frattini in order to put an end to the practice of divorce shopping , and to lessen the confusion for international couples , the european commission recently adopted two initiatives .
the first seeks new regulations on which laws and jurisdictions are applicable in divorce matters where spouses are of different nationalities .
the second initiative launches a public consultation on applicable law , jurisdiction and recognition in matters of property rights of married and unmarried couples . " these initiatives will simplify life for couples in the eu , " said commissioner for justice , liberty and security franco frattini .
" they will increase legal certainty and enable couples to know which law will apply to their matrimonial property regime and their divorce .
the aim is not to harmonize the national laws on divorce , which are very diverse , but to ensure to ensure legal certainty , flexibility and access to court . " the new regulations would still allow for some degree of divorce shopping , because of " a limited possibility to choose the applicable law and the competent court in divorce proceedings , " according to a commission statement . " this may be particularly useful in cases of divorce by mutual consent , " the statement said . but in cases where the divorce is contested , the new rules would not allow one partner to " rush to court " in countries permitting a quick divorce . " the proposal will reduce the incentive to ' rush to court ' since the applicable law will be designated on the basis of common rules independently of which court is seized , " the commission said . a mammoth task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malta is the only eu country where divorce is not allowed davidson applauded the commission for taking up the thorny issue of international divorces but said there was no way to tell how effective the proposals would be in cutting the confusion . " it is very much a growing problem and i don ’ t envy them finding a solution to it , " he said .
" it is hard enough to achieve a system in any one jurisdiction that is perfect ; trying to do this across 25 states seems near impossible . " the european commission 's proposals are being closely monitored by member states with both conservative and liberal laws on divorce . ireland and poland are keen to guard the catholic values which have led to their restrictive divorce laws , while malta – the only member state that does not permit divorce - is studying the text to make sure divorce is not introduced through the back door . " some member states wanted to make sure people could not circumvent or undermine national laws , " a commission official said .
" concerns were raised in both regards – from those member states with rather restrictive divorce laws but also those with liberal laws . " the proposals will go before the european parliament for its opinion , but whether or not they come into effect will ultimately be decided by the 25 member states , which must agree unanimously .
britain , ireland and denmark have an opt-out clause by which they can refuse to take part in eu policies . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france 's polygamy problem between 150,000 and 400,000 people live in polygamous households in france , in which a man is married to more than one woman .

i would be very happy if germany participated , " olmert told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g last week .
" i have informed chancellor angela merkel that we have absolutely no problem having german troops in south lebanon . " the israeli leader may have no problem , but germany certainly does . ever since the publication of olmert 's interview , the country is witnessing an intense domestic debate about the rights and wrongs of such a move . the german government has not entirely ruled out sending troops to the middle east . though chancellor angela merkel has rejected any immediate deployment of troops , defense minister franz josef jung said last month that if both sides in the conflict and the international community requested german participation , it would be difficult for berlin to decline . " difficult shared history " but , many citizens and politicians remain uneasy about sending soldiers to the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagoge in leipzig - some 110,000 jews live in germany today foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said last month that talks about germany 's involvement in a possible international peacekeeping force on the israeli-lebanon border were being treated with great sensitivity . " i think this is appropriate given the difficult shared history between germany and israel , " he told german broadcaster zdf . few doubt that more than 60 years after world war ii and the holocaust , in which the nazis killed about six million jews , sending german soldiers to the region would be far from controversial . deputy foreign minister gernot erler of the social democratic party ruled out a direct military involvement by german troops " for purely historical reasons . " in an interview with german daily die welt on saturday , erler said german troops could possibly be involved in reconstruction and training the lebanese army and police , but not in firing on israeli troops , if necessary , given germany 's persecution of europe 's jews during its nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli soldier smokes a cigarette at an artillery position near the lebanese border " it 's difficult to imagine german soldiers armed with guns facing off against israelis , " erler said . co n cer n s about n eutrality others have voiced concern that olmert 's explicit mention of a german role in the future peacekeeping mission would work to the country 's disadvantage and would make it make it difficult for germany to stay neutral .
germany will be seen as " partisan " in the eyes of the arab world , said oskar lafontaine of the opposition left party . some have criticized olmert 's statement that an international peacekeeping force would , above all , serve to protect israel from further attacks by the shiite militant group hezbollah instead of securing stability in lebanon after a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . " a peacekeeping force is no ' pro israel ' force , but rather it 's meant to be neutral , " birgit homburger , a defense expert of the opposition free-market liberals , fdp , told news agency reuters . on a more pragmatic note , some german politicians have emphasized that germany 's armed forces are already overstretched with peacekeeping deployments as far away as congo and afghanistan and simply lack the resources to participate in the middle east . " first facts , the n decisio n " though there is almost unanimous agreement that it 's too premature to talk of german participation given the fact that there 's still no un mandate or framework for an international peacekeeping force in the middle east , some believe that olmert 's frank talk may have opened up much-needed debate on what has long been considered taboo . olmert 's wish does show " that all those who have categorically ruled out german participation on historical grounds and thus seized control from us on how to formulate a mandate -lrb- for the peacekeeping force -rrb- have been wrong , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told news agency reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fierce fighting still continues on the israeli-lebanon border foreign minister steinmeier called olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east as a " noteworthy proof of trust " and one which made apparent " the extraordinarily good development between israel and germany in the past decades . " but , first the mandate , scope and composition of the international peacekeeping force has to be clarified , steinmeier added : " first the facts , then the decision .

" the 32-year-old director - whose 2004 hit movie " head on " was the first german film to win the berlin festival 's top prize in 17 years and later same year earned him the european film award - got into trouble after he was seen last week wearing a t-shirt with the last name of united states president george w. bush written on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has many opponents in germany while it is not illegal to wear the name of the us president stamped across your chest in germany , the director 's fashion statement with political implications consisted of a single four-letter word - bush - in which the letter " s " was written in the form of a swastika . " bush 's policies are comparable to those of the third reich , " akin told the german weekly der spiegel .
" i believe that films are being produced in hollywood on behalf of the pentagon in order to normalize things such as torture and guantanamo . " since using or displaying nazi regalia and other " unconstitutional symbols " is forbidden in germany , akin 's political statement could get him a prison sentence of up to three years . a political protest akin , who many hold to be among the most talented and successful young german movie directors , said he believes his t-shirt was not merely a provocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin said the shirt was to protest bush 's policies " the bush administration is out there looking for a third world war , i 'm convinced about it , " he said .
" in my mind , they are the fascists . " there are exceptions under the german law which allow the use of swastikas for artistic and educational purposes and if its use is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the police , however , had to initiate an investigation after a man , who saw the picture of akin wearing the contested t-shirt in a newspaper , decided to press charges . " you have to look into the context , " akin said .

2002 , magnus gäfgen kidnapped and murdered jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would choose the children that will receive help from the foundation . " my client is not trying to make money for himself , " heuchemer said . advertisi n g remorse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von metzler was brutally murdered this is not the first time that the enterprising lawyer is working on behalf of his client outside the courtroom .
heuchemer already published gäfgen 's autobiographical work " alone with god , " which gäfgen described as his " attempt at confronting , understanding and overcoming " what happened to him in 2002 . not everybody is convinced that the latest social project of the enterprising lawyer-client duo is exactly praiseworthy . " for young lawyers , it is very tempting to boost their career with such a case , " frank johnigk of the german federal chamber of lawyers told the german weekly der spiegel .
" it seems morally questionable , but legally there are no problems with it . " a n ecessary project ? supporters , on the other hand , like to stress that convicts , too , deserve a chance to truly repent for the crimes they have committed and that they need encouragement along the way . " this is a necessary project , " said joachim schultz-tornau , formerly a prominent politician and member of parliament in the german state of north rhine - westphalia .
" this is a meaningful sign of remorse . " schultz-tornau , who became gäfgen 's mentor in prison , published in 2005 a highly controversial " plea for a murderer , " in which he described gäfgen not as a " merciless killer " but " a human being with likable traits . "
his involvement in the case did not go down very well with his party - the free-market liberal fdp - which ultimately led to schultz-tornau 's exit from the political arena . huma n rights gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner , former frankfurt deputy police chief while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police chief wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court at the time . " with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european court for human rights in strasbourg , france gäfgen and his lawyer , however , thought differently .
gäfgen 's appeals before german courts were not successful , but last year he lodged a complaint against germany with the european human rights court . in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights which stipulate , on the one hand , that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment and , on the other , that everyone has the right to a fair trial . gäfgens liability claim against the state of hessen lead to the suspended sentencing of wolfgang daschner in december 2004 .
the former deputy police chief of the city of frankfurt was fined 10,800 euros for authorizing threats of torture to be used during investigation . gäfgen 's charitable foundation is yet to be approved by the authorities . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de murderer takes case to human rights court the convicted murderer of a prominent banker 's son has lodged a complaint at the european court of human rights over his treatment while in custody .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .

that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .

he has written an autobiography .
he is fighting legal battles against police torture .
he is starting a charitable foundation for children .
at the same time , he is a convicted child murderer . in sept .
2002 , magnus gäfgen kidnapped and murdered jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would choose the children that will receive help from the foundation . " my client is not trying to make money for himself , " heuchemer said . advertisi n g remorse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von metzler was brutally murdered this is not the first time that the enterprising lawyer is working on behalf of his client outside the courtroom .
heuchemer already published gäfgen 's autobiographical work " alone with god , " which gäfgen described as his " attempt at confronting , understanding and overcoming " what happened to him in 2002 . not everybody is convinced that the latest social project of the enterprising lawyer-client duo is exactly praiseworthy . " for young lawyers , it is very tempting to boost their career with such a case , " frank johnigk of the german federal chamber of lawyers told the german weekly der spiegel .
" it seems morally questionable , but legally there are no problems with it . " a n ecessary project ? supporters , on the other hand , like to stress that convicts , too , deserve a chance to truly repent for the crimes they have committed and that they need encouragement along the way . " this is a necessary project , " said joachim schultz-tornau , formerly a prominent politician and member of parliament in the german state of north rhine - westphalia .
" this is a meaningful sign of remorse . " schultz-tornau , who became gäfgen 's mentor in prison , published in 2005 a highly controversial " plea for a murderer , " in which he described gäfgen not as a " merciless killer " but " a human being with likable traits . "
his involvement in the case did not go down very well with his party - the free-market liberal fdp - which ultimately led to schultz-tornau 's exit from the political arena . huma n rights gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner , former frankfurt deputy police chief while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police chief wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court at the time .

" our activities respect the non-proliferation treaty ... so we will not accept the suspension -lrb- of uranium enrichment -rrb- , " nuclear chief ali larijani told a news conference , in the first formal reaction to the july 31 resolution .
" they should know that such resolutions will not affect our determination .
we will pursue the nuclear rights of iranians which are enshrined in the npt . " the un security council resolution requires iran to halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive nuclear fuel work by august 31 or face the prospect of sanctions . " this resolution has no legal credibility and it negates the purpose of the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency , " larijani said . the resolution was pushed through after iran ignored a previous non-binding deadline and failed to respond to an international offer of a package of incentives in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear fuel work . iran , opec 's second largest oil exporter , insists it wants to enrich uranium only to make reactor fuel for power stations , but there is widespread suspicion the country wants the capacity to make weapons-grade uranium . ira n war n s of oil " weapo n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could turn off its considerable oil supply larijani warned world powers against imposing sanctions , suggesting that iran could use oil as a weapon . " it will have a huge international impact , " he said .
" they will lose more than us .
they should not do something that will leave them shivering in winter . " larijani also said iran could expand its nuclear activities by increasing the cascade of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment . in april , iran said it had successfully enriched uranium to 3.5 percent using 164 centrifuges .
it also plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at its enrichment plant in natanz , in central iran , by the end of the iranian year in march 2007 . to reach weapons-grade material , the enrichment level has to reach more than 90 percent . i n ce n tive package still o n the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's un ambassador javad zarif was not happy larijani , however , said iran was still studying the package of incentives offered by britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states on june 6 , saying it " had the potential to resolve the nuclear issues . " the package , handed to tehran on june 6 , offers trade , technology , diplomatic and other incentives as well as multilateral talks - also involving the united states - if iran agrees to freeze enrichment . larijani said iran would respond to the offer by aug .
22 , but that the un resolution had " badly affected the opportunity -lrb- represented by the offer -rrb- and our attitude . " " the question is not what iran 's response will be , but to create an atmosphere to pursue the process -lrb- of negotiations -rrb- , " he said .

negotiations must be constructive and away from pressure , to enable the ambiguities to be removed . " even if they -lrb- the un security council members -rrb- have any reasons to -lrb- demand -rrb- suspension of enrichment they should address them in negotiation , " he added .
" but they can not prescribe it before talks . " the security council has charged iaea chief mohammed elbaradei with reporting back on iranian compliance . if it does not comply , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures " under article 41 of chapter 7 of the un charter , which relates to economic sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program .

" in an interview with german daily die welt on saturday , erler said german troops could possibly be involved in reconstruction and training the lebanese army and police , but not in firing on israeli troops , if necessary , given germany 's persecution of europe 's jews during its nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli soldier smokes a cigarette at an artillery position near the lebanese border " it 's difficult to imagine german soldiers armed with guns facing off against israelis , " erler said . co n cer n s about n eutrality others have voiced concern that olmert 's explicit mention of a german role in the future peacekeeping mission would work to the country 's disadvantage and would make it make it difficult for germany to stay neutral .
germany will be seen as " partisan " in the eyes of the arab world , said oskar lafontaine of the opposition left party . some have criticized olmert 's statement that an international peacekeeping force would , above all , serve to protect israel from further attacks by the shiite militant group hezbollah instead of securing stability in lebanon after a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . " a peacekeeping force is no ' pro israel ' force , but rather it 's meant to be neutral , " birgit homburger , a defense expert of the opposition free-market liberals , fdp , told news agency reuters . on a more pragmatic note , some german politicians have emphasized that germany 's armed forces are already overstretched with peacekeeping deployments as far away as congo and afghanistan and simply lack the resources to participate in the middle east . " first facts , the n decisio n " though there is almost unanimous agreement that it 's too premature to talk of german participation given the fact that there 's still no un mandate or framework for an international peacekeeping force in the middle east , some believe that olmert 's frank talk may have opened up much-needed debate on what has long been considered taboo . olmert 's wish does show " that all those who have categorically ruled out german participation on historical grounds and thus seized control from us on how to formulate a mandate -lrb- for the peacekeeping force -rrb- have been wrong , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told news agency reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fierce fighting still continues on the israeli-lebanon border foreign minister steinmeier called olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east as a " noteworthy proof of trust " and one which made apparent " the extraordinarily good development between israel and germany in the past decades . " but , first the mandate , scope and composition of the international peacekeeping force has to be clarified , steinmeier added : " first the facts , then the decision .

" our activities respect the non-proliferation treaty ... so we will not accept the suspension -lrb- of uranium enrichment -rrb- , " nuclear chief ali larijani told a news conference , in the first formal reaction to the july 31 resolution .
" they should know that such resolutions will not affect our determination .
we will pursue the nuclear rights of iranians which are enshrined in the npt . " the un security council resolution requires iran to halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive nuclear fuel work by august 31 or face the prospect of sanctions . " this resolution has no legal credibility and it negates the purpose of the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency , " larijani said . the resolution was pushed through after iran ignored a previous non-binding deadline and failed to respond to an international offer of a package of incentives in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear fuel work . iran , opec 's second largest oil exporter , insists it wants to enrich uranium only to make reactor fuel for power stations , but there is widespread suspicion the country wants the capacity to make weapons-grade uranium . ira n war n s of oil " weapo n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could turn off its considerable oil supply larijani warned world powers against imposing sanctions , suggesting that iran could use oil as a weapon . " it will have a huge international impact , " he said .
" they will lose more than us .
they should not do something that will leave them shivering in winter . " larijani also said iran could expand its nuclear activities by increasing the cascade of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment . in april , iran said it had successfully enriched uranium to 3.5 percent using 164 centrifuges .
it also plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at its enrichment plant in natanz , in central iran , by the end of the iranian year in march 2007 . to reach weapons-grade material , the enrichment level has to reach more than 90 percent . i n ce n tive package still o n the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's un ambassador javad zarif was not happy larijani , however , said iran was still studying the package of incentives offered by britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states on june 6 , saying it " had the potential to resolve the nuclear issues . " the package , handed to tehran on june 6 , offers trade , technology , diplomatic and other incentives as well as multilateral talks - also involving the united states - if iran agrees to freeze enrichment . larijani said iran would respond to the offer by aug .
22 , but that the un resolution had " badly affected the opportunity -lrb- represented by the offer -rrb- and our attitude . " " the question is not what iran 's response will be , but to create an atmosphere to pursue the process -lrb- of negotiations -rrb- , " he said .
" the proposal has positive points as well as ambiguities .
negotiations must be constructive and away from pressure , to enable the ambiguities to be removed . " even if they -lrb- the un security council members -rrb- have any reasons to -lrb- demand -rrb- suspension of enrichment they should address them in negotiation , " he added .
" but they can not prescribe it before talks . " the security council has charged iaea chief mohammed elbaradei with reporting back on iranian compliance . if it does not comply , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures " under article 41 of chapter 7 of the un charter , which relates to economic sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program .

but german farmers are losing out due to an inability to meet rising demand . with organic products increasing in popularity across the board despite being more expensive , one might think that organic farmers are raking in the profits . but just as " bio-food " takes off in germany 's many discount food chains , farmers are taking a financial hit from the no-frills segment , which is cutting the price of organic produce in line with the rest of the cheap items on offer . for german organic farmers , seeing their eco-friendly products , laboriously grown with care and conscience , on the shelves of discount supermarkets is a bitter pill to swallow .
while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad . " competing farmers in poland , italy , and the czech republic are at an advantage over their german competitors as they receive twice as much in government subsidies .
but in a bid to remain competitive and to keep german stores stocked with organic produce grown in germany , the farmers are facing another dilemma . problems converting to meet demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes three years for a conventional farm to be fully switch to organic the regulations in the organic farming sector concerning growth agents and agricultural techniques are so strict , and the time and costs involved in cultivating bio-produce so demanding , that german farmers find themselves unable to meet the rising demand .
and for conventional farmers looking to convert to organic farming in a bid to profit from that demand , there are also problems . the switch to organic is a costly one for conventional farmers .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .
on the other hand , it 's also our responsibility to criticize the foreign policy of the german government where it 's wrongly used .
that 's why i said that the german government should n't get entangled too deeply in the bush administration 's workings when it comes to its political efforts .
after all , the bush administration has largely squandered its goodwill and reputation in the middle east and the arab world . naser shrouf interviewed oskar lafontaine -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still reticent about involvement in mideast mission they may not have rejected outright israeli leader olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east , but german politicians harbor deep reservations about the controversial proposal .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .
on the other hand , it 's also our responsibility to criticize the foreign policy of the german government where it 's wrongly used .
that 's why i said that the german government should n't get entangled too deeply in the bush administration 's workings when it comes to its political efforts .

" the 32-year-old director - whose 2004 hit movie " head on " was the first german film to win the berlin festival 's top prize in 17 years and later same year earned him the european film award - got into trouble after he was seen last week wearing a t-shirt with the last name of united states president george w. bush written on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has many opponents in germany while it is not illegal to wear the name of the us president stamped across your chest in germany , the director 's fashion statement with political implications consisted of a single four-letter word - bush - in which the letter " s " was written in the form of a swastika . " bush 's policies are comparable to those of the third reich , " akin told the german weekly der spiegel .
" i believe that films are being produced in hollywood on behalf of the pentagon in order to normalize things such as torture and guantanamo . " since using or displaying nazi regalia and other " unconstitutional symbols " is forbidden in germany , akin 's political statement could get him a prison sentence of up to three years . a political protest akin , who many hold to be among the most talented and successful young german movie directors , said he believes his t-shirt was not merely a provocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin said the shirt was to protest bush 's policies " the bush administration is out there looking for a third world war , i 'm convinced about it , " he said .
" in my mind , they are the fascists . " there are exceptions under the german law which allow the use of swastikas for artistic and educational purposes and if its use is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the police , however , had to initiate an investigation after a man , who saw the picture of akin wearing the contested t-shirt in a newspaper , decided to press charges . " you have to look into the context , " akin said .

" we must take into consideration everyone 's concerns , while keeping the text 's logic . " leba n o n rejects resolutio n the passing of the resolution floundered after qatar , the only arab member of the council , and lebanon voiced their unhappiness with the text and demanded modifications .
both russia and china argued in favor of making the text more attractive to lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli army convoy next to the border with lebanon , in northern israel the chief hurdle is the presence of some 10,000 israeli troops in southern lebanon .
the draft does not call for their withdrawal , which would be left to a follow-up resolution authorizing an international force and setting peace terms . lebanese foreign ministry official nouhad mahmoud told reuters that the current text was " not implementable . " " definitely the intention of those who are working on it is the intention for peace , and that 's why we are telling them that its not adequate that it does not really achieve the objective that they 've set for themselves , " said lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . syrian foreign minister walid muallem also said the un draft resolution to end the conflict was " a recipe for the continuation of war . " the draft resolution - favored by israel and the us - does however call for a " full cessation of hostilities " and says hezbollah must stop all attacks while israel must halt " offensive military operations . "
it also calls on un peacekeepers to monitor the truce and stipulates principles necessary for a permanent political settlement . merkel : resolutio n a n " importa n t step " despite misgivings in the arab world about the us-french draft resolution , leaders elsewhere in europe have welcomed it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has hailed the resolution german chancellor angela merkel called it " an important step towards a halt in military operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.08.2006 " germany should be seen as a fair partner by both sides " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict in the middle east has killed and displaced hundreds dw-world.de spoke to oskar lafontaine of germany 's opposition left party about his take on the middle east conflict , the difficulty of criticizing israel and the possibility of germany aligning too closely with the us . oskar lafontaine is the parliamentary chairman of germany 's left party and also served as the social democratic party chairman and german finance minister . dw-world.de : what is the left party 's position on the current conflict in the middle east ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine is head of the parliamentary group of the left party oskar lafontaine : first , we demand an immediate ceasefire because we need to avoid additional civilians being killed , injured or their health being permanently damaged . secondly , we demand all sides involved finally respect international law .
the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .
on the other hand , it 's also our responsibility to criticize the foreign policy of the german government where it 's wrongly used .
that 's why i said that the german government should n't get entangled too deeply in the bush administration 's workings when it comes to its political efforts .
after all , the bush administration has largely squandered its goodwill and reputation in the middle east and the arab world . naser shrouf interviewed oskar lafontaine -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still reticent about involvement in mideast mission they may not have rejected outright israeli leader olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east , but german politicians harbor deep reservations about the controversial proposal .

" our activities respect the non-proliferation treaty ... so we will not accept the suspension -lrb- of uranium enrichment -rrb- , " nuclear chief ali larijani told a news conference , in the first formal reaction to the july 31 resolution .
" they should know that such resolutions will not affect our determination .
we will pursue the nuclear rights of iranians which are enshrined in the npt . " the un security council resolution requires iran to halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive nuclear fuel work by august 31 or face the prospect of sanctions . " this resolution has no legal credibility and it negates the purpose of the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency , " larijani said . the resolution was pushed through after iran ignored a previous non-binding deadline and failed to respond to an international offer of a package of incentives in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear fuel work . iran , opec 's second largest oil exporter , insists it wants to enrich uranium only to make reactor fuel for power stations , but there is widespread suspicion the country wants the capacity to make weapons-grade uranium . ira n war n s of oil " weapo n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could turn off its considerable oil supply larijani warned world powers against imposing sanctions , suggesting that iran could use oil as a weapon . " it will have a huge international impact , " he said .
" they will lose more than us .
they should not do something that will leave them shivering in winter . " larijani also said iran could expand its nuclear activities by increasing the cascade of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment . in april , iran said it had successfully enriched uranium to 3.5 percent using 164 centrifuges .
it also plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at its enrichment plant in natanz , in central iran , by the end of the iranian year in march 2007 . to reach weapons-grade material , the enrichment level has to reach more than 90 percent . i n ce n tive package still o n the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's un ambassador javad zarif was not happy larijani , however , said iran was still studying the package of incentives offered by britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states on june 6 , saying it " had the potential to resolve the nuclear issues . " the package , handed to tehran on june 6 , offers trade , technology , diplomatic and other incentives as well as multilateral talks - also involving the united states - if iran agrees to freeze enrichment . larijani said iran would respond to the offer by aug .
22 , but that the un resolution had " badly affected the opportunity -lrb- represented by the offer -rrb- and our attitude . " " the question is not what iran 's response will be , but to create an atmosphere to pursue the process -lrb- of negotiations -rrb- , " he said .

negotiations must be constructive and away from pressure , to enable the ambiguities to be removed . " even if they -lrb- the un security council members -rrb- have any reasons to -lrb- demand -rrb- suspension of enrichment they should address them in negotiation , " he added .
" but they can not prescribe it before talks . " the security council has charged iaea chief mohammed elbaradei with reporting back on iranian compliance . if it does not comply , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures " under article 41 of chapter 7 of the un charter , which relates to economic sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program .

" the 32-year-old director - whose 2004 hit movie " head on " was the first german film to win the berlin festival 's top prize in 17 years and later same year earned him the european film award - got into trouble after he was seen last week wearing a t-shirt with the last name of united states president george w. bush written on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has many opponents in germany while it is not illegal to wear the name of the us president stamped across your chest in germany , the director 's fashion statement with political implications consisted of a single four-letter word - bush - in which the letter " s " was written in the form of a swastika . " bush 's policies are comparable to those of the third reich , " akin told the german weekly der spiegel .
" i believe that films are being produced in hollywood on behalf of the pentagon in order to normalize things such as torture and guantanamo . " since using or displaying nazi regalia and other " unconstitutional symbols " is forbidden in germany , akin 's political statement could get him a prison sentence of up to three years . a political protest akin , who many hold to be among the most talented and successful young german movie directors , said he believes his t-shirt was not merely a provocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin said the shirt was to protest bush 's policies " the bush administration is out there looking for a third world war , i 'm convinced about it , " he said .
" in my mind , they are the fascists . " there are exceptions under the german law which allow the use of swastikas for artistic and educational purposes and if its use is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the police , however , had to initiate an investigation after a man , who saw the picture of akin wearing the contested t-shirt in a newspaper , decided to press charges . " you have to look into the context , " akin said .
" the swastika is not there on its own , but as part of the word , ' bush . '

" the 32-year-old director - whose 2004 hit movie " head on " was the first german film to win the berlin festival 's top prize in 17 years and later same year earned him the european film award - got into trouble after he was seen last week wearing a t-shirt with the last name of united states president george w. bush written on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has many opponents in germany while it is not illegal to wear the name of the us president stamped across your chest in germany , the director 's fashion statement with political implications consisted of a single four-letter word - bush - in which the letter " s " was written in the form of a swastika . " bush 's policies are comparable to those of the third reich , " akin told the german weekly der spiegel .
" i believe that films are being produced in hollywood on behalf of the pentagon in order to normalize things such as torture and guantanamo . " since using or displaying nazi regalia and other " unconstitutional symbols " is forbidden in germany , akin 's political statement could get him a prison sentence of up to three years . a political protest akin , who many hold to be among the most talented and successful young german movie directors , said he believes his t-shirt was not merely a provocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin said the shirt was to protest bush 's policies " the bush administration is out there looking for a third world war , i 'm convinced about it , " he said .
" in my mind , they are the fascists . " there are exceptions under the german law which allow the use of swastikas for artistic and educational purposes and if its use is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the police , however , had to initiate an investigation after a man , who saw the picture of akin wearing the contested t-shirt in a newspaper , decided to press charges . " you have to look into the context , " akin said .
" the swastika is not there on its own , but as part of the word , ' bush . '
one would have to be pretty stupid , not to understand that . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart seeks to ban anti-fascist symbols the use of swastikas is banned under german law .

" our activities respect the non-proliferation treaty ... so we will not accept the suspension -lrb- of uranium enrichment -rrb- , " nuclear chief ali larijani told a news conference , in the first formal reaction to the july 31 resolution .
" they should know that such resolutions will not affect our determination .
we will pursue the nuclear rights of iranians which are enshrined in the npt . " the un security council resolution requires iran to halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive nuclear fuel work by august 31 or face the prospect of sanctions . " this resolution has no legal credibility and it negates the purpose of the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency , " larijani said . the resolution was pushed through after iran ignored a previous non-binding deadline and failed to respond to an international offer of a package of incentives in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear fuel work . iran , opec 's second largest oil exporter , insists it wants to enrich uranium only to make reactor fuel for power stations , but there is widespread suspicion the country wants the capacity to make weapons-grade uranium . ira n war n s of oil " weapo n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could turn off its considerable oil supply larijani warned world powers against imposing sanctions , suggesting that iran could use oil as a weapon . " it will have a huge international impact , " he said .
" they will lose more than us .
they should not do something that will leave them shivering in winter . " larijani also said iran could expand its nuclear activities by increasing the cascade of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment . in april , iran said it had successfully enriched uranium to 3.5 percent using 164 centrifuges .
it also plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at its enrichment plant in natanz , in central iran , by the end of the iranian year in march 2007 . to reach weapons-grade material , the enrichment level has to reach more than 90 percent . i n ce n tive package still o n the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's un ambassador javad zarif was not happy larijani , however , said iran was still studying the package of incentives offered by britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states on june 6 , saying it " had the potential to resolve the nuclear issues . " the package , handed to tehran on june 6 , offers trade , technology , diplomatic and other incentives as well as multilateral talks - also involving the united states - if iran agrees to freeze enrichment . larijani said iran would respond to the offer by aug .
22 , but that the un resolution had " badly affected the opportunity -lrb- represented by the offer -rrb- and our attitude . " " the question is not what iran 's response will be , but to create an atmosphere to pursue the process -lrb- of negotiations -rrb- , " he said .
" the proposal has positive points as well as ambiguities .
negotiations must be constructive and away from pressure , to enable the ambiguities to be removed . " even if they -lrb- the un security council members -rrb- have any reasons to -lrb- demand -rrb- suspension of enrichment they should address them in negotiation , " he added .
" but they can not prescribe it before talks . " the security council has charged iaea chief mohammed elbaradei with reporting back on iranian compliance . if it does not comply , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures " under article 41 of chapter 7 of the un charter , which relates to economic sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program .

he has written an autobiography .
he is fighting legal battles against police torture .
he is starting a charitable foundation for children .
at the same time , he is a convicted child murderer . in sept .
2002 , magnus gäfgen kidnapped and murdered jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would choose the children that will receive help from the foundation . " my client is not trying to make money for himself , " heuchemer said . advertisi n g remorse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von metzler was brutally murdered this is not the first time that the enterprising lawyer is working on behalf of his client outside the courtroom .
heuchemer already published gäfgen 's autobiographical work " alone with god , " which gäfgen described as his " attempt at confronting , understanding and overcoming " what happened to him in 2002 . not everybody is convinced that the latest social project of the enterprising lawyer-client duo is exactly praiseworthy . " for young lawyers , it is very tempting to boost their career with such a case , " frank johnigk of the german federal chamber of lawyers told the german weekly der spiegel .
" it seems morally questionable , but legally there are no problems with it . " a n ecessary project ? supporters , on the other hand , like to stress that convicts , too , deserve a chance to truly repent for the crimes they have committed and that they need encouragement along the way . " this is a necessary project , " said joachim schultz-tornau , formerly a prominent politician and member of parliament in the german state of north rhine - westphalia .
" this is a meaningful sign of remorse . " schultz-tornau , who became gäfgen 's mentor in prison , published in 2005 a highly controversial " plea for a murderer , " in which he described gäfgen not as a " merciless killer " but " a human being with likable traits . "
his involvement in the case did not go down very well with his party - the free-market liberal fdp - which ultimately led to schultz-tornau 's exit from the political arena . huma n rights gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner , former frankfurt deputy police chief while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police chief wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court at the time . " with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european court for human rights in strasbourg , france gäfgen and his lawyer , however , thought differently .
gäfgen 's appeals before german courts were not successful , but last year he lodged a complaint against germany with the european human rights court . in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights which stipulate , on the one hand , that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment and , on the other , that everyone has the right to a fair trial . gäfgens liability claim against the state of hessen lead to the suspended sentencing of wolfgang daschner in december 2004 .
the former deputy police chief of the city of frankfurt was fined 10,800 euros for authorizing threats of torture to be used during investigation . gäfgen 's charitable foundation is yet to be approved by the authorities . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de murderer takes case to human rights court the convicted murderer of a prominent banker 's son has lodged a complaint at the european court of human rights over his treatment while in custody .

but german farmers are losing out due to an inability to meet rising demand . with organic products increasing in popularity across the board despite being more expensive , one might think that organic farmers are raking in the profits . but just as " bio-food " takes off in germany 's many discount food chains , farmers are taking a financial hit from the no-frills segment , which is cutting the price of organic produce in line with the rest of the cheap items on offer . for german organic farmers , seeing their eco-friendly products , laboriously grown with care and conscience , on the shelves of discount supermarkets is a bitter pill to swallow .
while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad . " competing farmers in poland , italy , and the czech republic are at an advantage over their german competitors as they receive twice as much in government subsidies .
but in a bid to remain competitive and to keep german stores stocked with organic produce grown in germany , the farmers are facing another dilemma . problems converting to meet demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes three years for a conventional farm to be fully switch to organic the regulations in the organic farming sector concerning growth agents and agricultural techniques are so strict , and the time and costs involved in cultivating bio-produce so demanding , that german farmers find themselves unable to meet the rising demand .
and for conventional farmers looking to convert to organic farming in a bid to profit from that demand , there are also problems . the switch to organic is a costly one for conventional farmers .
a farm beginning to produce organically grown food can expect to earn 60 percent less in revenue at the start of its new business . " the change from conventional to organic farming does not happen overnight , " said achim spiller , professor for agrarian marketing at the university of göttingen .
" it takes at least three years of conforming to organic guidelines until a farmer can sell produce under the ' bio ' label . " foreign competition adding pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition from latin america is adding to the pressure with the discounters slashing the prices of organic products and foreign growers increasing competition , the consumers are looking like the winners of germany 's " bio-boom " while german farmers are almost certainly on the losing side . " in eastern europe and latin america , there is a focus on producing organic food and the industry is strongly promoted by governments , " spiller said .
" many third world countries also use organic cultivation as they have had little access to fertilizer and pesticides in the past . " hermann heldberg , a health food wholesaler for over 30 years , is just one of a growing number of people in the organic food industry who are calling for the german government to help farmers . " we are behind the likes of the netherlands in producing organic vegetables , " he said .
" it is heavily promoted there and if a dutch firm wants to expand and export its goods to germany , then there is a big market here for them .
but we also can produce cucumbers and peppers .

the draft does not call for their withdrawal , which would be left to a follow-up resolution authorizing an international force and setting peace terms . lebanese foreign ministry official nouhad mahmoud told reuters that the current text was " not implementable . " " definitely the intention of those who are working on it is the intention for peace , and that 's why we are telling them that its not adequate that it does not really achieve the objective that they 've set for themselves , " said lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . syrian foreign minister walid muallem also said the un draft resolution to end the conflict was " a recipe for the continuation of war . " the draft resolution - favored by israel and the us - does however call for a " full cessation of hostilities " and says hezbollah must stop all attacks while israel must halt " offensive military operations . "
it also calls on un peacekeepers to monitor the truce and stipulates principles necessary for a permanent political settlement . merkel : resolutio n a n " importa n t step " despite misgivings in the arab world about the us-french draft resolution , leaders elsewhere in europe have welcomed it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has hailed the resolution german chancellor angela merkel called it " an important step towards a halt in military operations . "
merkel stressed the resolution contained the right message . " the accord on a resolution for the middle east is a strong signal by the international community to the parties involved in the conflict , " merkel was quoted by a government spokesman as saying . olmert : " do n ' t preach to us " even as the german government mulls the possibility of sending german peacekeepers to the middle east after an explicit statement to that effect by israeli prime minister ehud olmert in a newspaper interview , the israeli leader took a swipe at european leaders ' heightening concerns about mounting civilian losses in lebanon as a result of israeli strikes . in an interview published sunday in german newspaper welt am so n n tag , olmert told european leaders to stop preaching to him about civilian war casualties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert says europeans have no right to preach to israel " where do they get the right to preach to israel ? "
olmert said .
" european countries attacked kosovo and killed 10,000 civilians .
ten thousand !
and none of these countries had to suffer before that from a single rocket , " he said .
" i 'm not saying it was wrong to intervene in kosovo .
but please : do n't preach to us about the treatment of civilians . " meanwhile , there was no letup in the violence which has killed over 770 people in lebanon , mostly civilians , and over 90 israelis .

but german farmers are losing out due to an inability to meet rising demand . with organic products increasing in popularity across the board despite being more expensive , one might think that organic farmers are raking in the profits . but just as " bio-food " takes off in germany 's many discount food chains , farmers are taking a financial hit from the no-frills segment , which is cutting the price of organic produce in line with the rest of the cheap items on offer . for german organic farmers , seeing their eco-friendly products , laboriously grown with care and conscience , on the shelves of discount supermarkets is a bitter pill to swallow .
while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad . " competing farmers in poland , italy , and the czech republic are at an advantage over their german competitors as they receive twice as much in government subsidies .
but in a bid to remain competitive and to keep german stores stocked with organic produce grown in germany , the farmers are facing another dilemma . problems converting to meet demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes three years for a conventional farm to be fully switch to organic the regulations in the organic farming sector concerning growth agents and agricultural techniques are so strict , and the time and costs involved in cultivating bio-produce so demanding , that german farmers find themselves unable to meet the rising demand .
and for conventional farmers looking to convert to organic farming in a bid to profit from that demand , there are also problems . the switch to organic is a costly one for conventional farmers .
a farm beginning to produce organically grown food can expect to earn 60 percent less in revenue at the start of its new business . " the change from conventional to organic farming does not happen overnight , " said achim spiller , professor for agrarian marketing at the university of göttingen .
" it takes at least three years of conforming to organic guidelines until a farmer can sell produce under the ' bio ' label . " foreign competition adding pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition from latin america is adding to the pressure with the discounters slashing the prices of organic products and foreign growers increasing competition , the consumers are looking like the winners of germany 's " bio-boom " while german farmers are almost certainly on the losing side . " in eastern europe and latin america , there is a focus on producing organic food and the industry is strongly promoted by governments , " spiller said .
" many third world countries also use organic cultivation as they have had little access to fertilizer and pesticides in the past . " hermann heldberg , a health food wholesaler for over 30 years , is just one of a growing number of people in the organic food industry who are calling for the german government to help farmers . " we are behind the likes of the netherlands in producing organic vegetables , " he said .
" it is heavily promoted there and if a dutch firm wants to expand and export its goods to germany , then there is a big market here for them .
but we also can produce cucumbers and peppers . " carolin hoffrogge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan recent meat scandals at home have benefited the organic food industry in germany , a country which can rightly claim to be europe 's largest consumer of bio-foods .

he has written an autobiography .
he is fighting legal battles against police torture .
he is starting a charitable foundation for children .
at the same time , he is a convicted child murderer . in sept .
2002 , magnus gäfgen kidnapped and murdered jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would choose the children that will receive help from the foundation . " my client is not trying to make money for himself , " heuchemer said . advertisi n g remorse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von metzler was brutally murdered this is not the first time that the enterprising lawyer is working on behalf of his client outside the courtroom .
heuchemer already published gäfgen 's autobiographical work " alone with god , " which gäfgen described as his " attempt at confronting , understanding and overcoming " what happened to him in 2002 . not everybody is convinced that the latest social project of the enterprising lawyer-client duo is exactly praiseworthy . " for young lawyers , it is very tempting to boost their career with such a case , " frank johnigk of the german federal chamber of lawyers told the german weekly der spiegel .
" it seems morally questionable , but legally there are no problems with it . " a n ecessary project ? supporters , on the other hand , like to stress that convicts , too , deserve a chance to truly repent for the crimes they have committed and that they need encouragement along the way . " this is a necessary project , " said joachim schultz-tornau , formerly a prominent politician and member of parliament in the german state of north rhine - westphalia .
" this is a meaningful sign of remorse . " schultz-tornau , who became gäfgen 's mentor in prison , published in 2005 a highly controversial " plea for a murderer , " in which he described gäfgen not as a " merciless killer " but " a human being with likable traits . "
his involvement in the case did not go down very well with his party - the free-market liberal fdp - which ultimately led to schultz-tornau 's exit from the political arena . huma n rights gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.08.2006 " germany should be seen as a fair partner by both sides " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict in the middle east has killed and displaced hundreds dw-world.de spoke to oskar lafontaine of germany 's opposition left party about his take on the middle east conflict , the difficulty of criticizing israel and the possibility of germany aligning too closely with the us . oskar lafontaine is the parliamentary chairman of germany 's left party and also served as the social democratic party chairman and german finance minister . dw-world.de : what is the left party 's position on the current conflict in the middle east ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine is head of the parliamentary group of the left party oskar lafontaine : first , we demand an immediate ceasefire because we need to avoid additional civilians being killed , injured or their health being permanently damaged . secondly , we demand all sides involved finally respect international law .
the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .

" the 32-year-old director - whose 2004 hit movie " head on " was the first german film to win the berlin festival 's top prize in 17 years and later same year earned him the european film award - got into trouble after he was seen last week wearing a t-shirt with the last name of united states president george w. bush written on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has many opponents in germany while it is not illegal to wear the name of the us president stamped across your chest in germany , the director 's fashion statement with political implications consisted of a single four-letter word - bush - in which the letter " s " was written in the form of a swastika . " bush 's policies are comparable to those of the third reich , " akin told the german weekly der spiegel .
" i believe that films are being produced in hollywood on behalf of the pentagon in order to normalize things such as torture and guantanamo . " since using or displaying nazi regalia and other " unconstitutional symbols " is forbidden in germany , akin 's political statement could get him a prison sentence of up to three years . a political protest akin , who many hold to be among the most talented and successful young german movie directors , said he believes his t-shirt was not merely a provocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin said the shirt was to protest bush 's policies " the bush administration is out there looking for a third world war , i 'm convinced about it , " he said .
" in my mind , they are the fascists . " there are exceptions under the german law which allow the use of swastikas for artistic and educational purposes and if its use is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the police , however , had to initiate an investigation after a man , who saw the picture of akin wearing the contested t-shirt in a newspaper , decided to press charges . " you have to look into the context , " akin said .
" the swastika is not there on its own , but as part of the word , ' bush . '

" the 32-year-old director - whose 2004 hit movie " head on " was the first german film to win the berlin festival 's top prize in 17 years and later same year earned him the european film award - got into trouble after he was seen last week wearing a t-shirt with the last name of united states president george w. bush written on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has many opponents in germany while it is not illegal to wear the name of the us president stamped across your chest in germany , the director 's fashion statement with political implications consisted of a single four-letter word - bush - in which the letter " s " was written in the form of a swastika . " bush 's policies are comparable to those of the third reich , " akin told the german weekly der spiegel .
" i believe that films are being produced in hollywood on behalf of the pentagon in order to normalize things such as torture and guantanamo . " since using or displaying nazi regalia and other " unconstitutional symbols " is forbidden in germany , akin 's political statement could get him a prison sentence of up to three years . a political protest akin , who many hold to be among the most talented and successful young german movie directors , said he believes his t-shirt was not merely a provocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin said the shirt was to protest bush 's policies " the bush administration is out there looking for a third world war , i 'm convinced about it , " he said .
" in my mind , they are the fascists . " there are exceptions under the german law which allow the use of swastikas for artistic and educational purposes and if its use is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the police , however , had to initiate an investigation after a man , who saw the picture of akin wearing the contested t-shirt in a newspaper , decided to press charges . " you have to look into the context , " akin said .
" the swastika is not there on its own , but as part of the word , ' bush . '

but german farmers are losing out due to an inability to meet rising demand . with organic products increasing in popularity across the board despite being more expensive , one might think that organic farmers are raking in the profits . but just as " bio-food " takes off in germany 's many discount food chains , farmers are taking a financial hit from the no-frills segment , which is cutting the price of organic produce in line with the rest of the cheap items on offer . for german organic farmers , seeing their eco-friendly products , laboriously grown with care and conscience , on the shelves of discount supermarkets is a bitter pill to swallow .
while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad . " competing farmers in poland , italy , and the czech republic are at an advantage over their german competitors as they receive twice as much in government subsidies .
but in a bid to remain competitive and to keep german stores stocked with organic produce grown in germany , the farmers are facing another dilemma . problems converting to meet demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes three years for a conventional farm to be fully switch to organic the regulations in the organic farming sector concerning growth agents and agricultural techniques are so strict , and the time and costs involved in cultivating bio-produce so demanding , that german farmers find themselves unable to meet the rising demand .
and for conventional farmers looking to convert to organic farming in a bid to profit from that demand , there are also problems . the switch to organic is a costly one for conventional farmers .
a farm beginning to produce organically grown food can expect to earn 60 percent less in revenue at the start of its new business . " the change from conventional to organic farming does not happen overnight , " said achim spiller , professor for agrarian marketing at the university of göttingen .
" it takes at least three years of conforming to organic guidelines until a farmer can sell produce under the ' bio ' label . " foreign competition adding pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition from latin america is adding to the pressure with the discounters slashing the prices of organic products and foreign growers increasing competition , the consumers are looking like the winners of germany 's " bio-boom " while german farmers are almost certainly on the losing side . " in eastern europe and latin america , there is a focus on producing organic food and the industry is strongly promoted by governments , " spiller said .
" many third world countries also use organic cultivation as they have had little access to fertilizer and pesticides in the past . " hermann heldberg , a health food wholesaler for over 30 years , is just one of a growing number of people in the organic food industry who are calling for the german government to help farmers . " we are behind the likes of the netherlands in producing organic vegetables , " he said .
" it is heavily promoted there and if a dutch firm wants to expand and export its goods to germany , then there is a big market here for them .
but we also can produce cucumbers and peppers . " carolin hoffrogge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan recent meat scandals at home have benefited the organic food industry in germany , a country which can rightly claim to be europe 's largest consumer of bio-foods .

" the un security council resolution requires iran to halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive nuclear fuel work by august 31 or face the prospect of sanctions . " this resolution has no legal credibility and it negates the purpose of the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency , " larijani said . the resolution was pushed through after iran ignored a previous non-binding deadline and failed to respond to an international offer of a package of incentives in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear fuel work . iran , opec 's second largest oil exporter , insists it wants to enrich uranium only to make reactor fuel for power stations , but there is widespread suspicion the country wants the capacity to make weapons-grade uranium . ira n war n s of oil " weapo n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could turn off its considerable oil supply larijani warned world powers against imposing sanctions , suggesting that iran could use oil as a weapon .

" they will lose more than us .
they should not do something that will leave them shivering in winter . " larijani also said iran could expand its nuclear activities by increasing the cascade of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment . in april , iran said it had successfully enriched uranium to 3.5 percent using 164 centrifuges .
it also plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at its enrichment plant in natanz , in central iran , by the end of the iranian year in march 2007 . to reach weapons-grade material , the enrichment level has to reach more than 90 percent . i n ce n tive package still o n the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's un ambassador javad zarif was not happy larijani , however , said iran was still studying the package of incentives offered by britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states on june 6 , saying it " had the potential to resolve the nuclear issues . " the package , handed to tehran on june 6 , offers trade , technology , diplomatic and other incentives as well as multilateral talks - also involving the united states - if iran agrees to freeze enrichment . larijani said iran would respond to the offer by aug .
22 , but that the un resolution had " badly affected the opportunity -lrb- represented by the offer -rrb- and our attitude . " " the question is not what iran 's response will be , but to create an atmosphere to pursue the process -lrb- of negotiations -rrb- , " he said .

negotiations must be constructive and away from pressure , to enable the ambiguities to be removed . " even if they -lrb- the un security council members -rrb- have any reasons to -lrb- demand -rrb- suspension of enrichment they should address them in negotiation , " he added .
" but they can not prescribe it before talks . " the security council has charged iaea chief mohammed elbaradei with reporting back on iranian compliance . if it does not comply , the council would consider adopting " appropriate measures " under article 41 of chapter 7 of the un charter , which relates to economic sanctions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.08.2006 eu proposes new rules to simplify cross-border divorces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what happens if it the fairytale does n't last ?
each year , thousands of international couples file for divorce in the eu – a complicated affair as there are no clear rules on which national laws apply to their divorce .
now , the eu is aiming to simplify matters . with more freedom of movement within the european union have come more cross-border marriages .
but not all of these marriages last a lifetime .
each year , up to 170,000 international couples file for divorce in the eu – representing 16 percent of all separations in europe .
in addition to their personal problems , the divorcing couple is also confronted with a myriad of practical and legal problems exacerbated by the lack of any common eu family law . there are many widely varying legal systems and divorce procedures in the eu 's member states .
in ireland , for example , couples must have a four-year separation period before they can divorce , whereas in finland , a divorce can be obtained in six months .
at present , it is often difficult for international couples – where spouses are either of different nationalities , live in different member states , or have the same nationality but live in a member state other than their state of origin – to know which laws apply to their divorce . additionally , the current situation can lead to " divorce shopping " where one spouse will " rush to court , " said david davidson , head of the family department at leading london law firm charles russell . " due to the enormous difference in the financial relief given to spouses in different eu jurisdictions , inevitably , you ’ re going to have situations where husbands will try to file where wives get less , and wives try to file where wives get more , " davidson said . " one of the consequences of this is that when a marriage hits rocks , rather than sitting down and talking through their problems and seeking to reconcile or deal with things in an amicable fashion , the couple are compelled by these rules to fire the gun as it were , and start the process of dissolution of marriage in order to achieve a tactical advantage . " stopping " divorce shopping " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for justice , freedom and security franco frattini in order to put an end to the practice of divorce shopping , and to lessen the confusion for international couples , the european commission recently adopted two initiatives .
the first seeks new regulations on which laws and jurisdictions are applicable in divorce matters where spouses are of different nationalities .
the second initiative launches a public consultation on applicable law , jurisdiction and recognition in matters of property rights of married and unmarried couples . " these initiatives will simplify life for couples in the eu , " said commissioner for justice , liberty and security franco frattini .
" they will increase legal certainty and enable couples to know which law will apply to their matrimonial property regime and their divorce .
the aim is not to harmonize the national laws on divorce , which are very diverse , but to ensure to ensure legal certainty , flexibility and access to court . " the new regulations would still allow for some degree of divorce shopping , because of " a limited possibility to choose the applicable law and the competent court in divorce proceedings , " according to a commission statement . " this may be particularly useful in cases of divorce by mutual consent , " the statement said . but in cases where the divorce is contested , the new rules would not allow one partner to " rush to court " in countries permitting a quick divorce . " the proposal will reduce the incentive to ' rush to court ' since the applicable law will be designated on the basis of common rules independently of which court is seized , " the commission said . a mammoth task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malta is the only eu country where divorce is not allowed davidson applauded the commission for taking up the thorny issue of international divorces but said there was no way to tell how effective the proposals would be in cutting the confusion . " it is very much a growing problem and i don ’ t envy them finding a solution to it , " he said .
" it is hard enough to achieve a system in any one jurisdiction that is perfect ; trying to do this across 25 states seems near impossible . " the european commission 's proposals are being closely monitored by member states with both conservative and liberal laws on divorce . ireland and poland are keen to guard the catholic values which have led to their restrictive divorce laws , while malta – the only member state that does not permit divorce - is studying the text to make sure divorce is not introduced through the back door . " some member states wanted to make sure people could not circumvent or undermine national laws , " a commission official said .
" concerns were raised in both regards – from those member states with rather restrictive divorce laws but also those with liberal laws . " the proposals will go before the european parliament for its opinion , but whether or not they come into effect will ultimately be decided by the 25 member states , which must agree unanimously .

but german farmers are losing out due to an inability to meet rising demand . with organic products increasing in popularity across the board despite being more expensive , one might think that organic farmers are raking in the profits . but just as " bio-food " takes off in germany 's many discount food chains , farmers are taking a financial hit from the no-frills segment , which is cutting the price of organic produce in line with the rest of the cheap items on offer . for german organic farmers , seeing their eco-friendly products , laboriously grown with care and conscience , on the shelves of discount supermarkets is a bitter pill to swallow .
while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad . " competing farmers in poland , italy , and the czech republic are at an advantage over their german competitors as they receive twice as much in government subsidies .
but in a bid to remain competitive and to keep german stores stocked with organic produce grown in germany , the farmers are facing another dilemma . problems converting to meet demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes three years for a conventional farm to be fully switch to organic the regulations in the organic farming sector concerning growth agents and agricultural techniques are so strict , and the time and costs involved in cultivating bio-produce so demanding , that german farmers find themselves unable to meet the rising demand .
and for conventional farmers looking to convert to organic farming in a bid to profit from that demand , there are also problems . the switch to organic is a costly one for conventional farmers .
a farm beginning to produce organically grown food can expect to earn 60 percent less in revenue at the start of its new business . " the change from conventional to organic farming does not happen overnight , " said achim spiller , professor for agrarian marketing at the university of göttingen .
" it takes at least three years of conforming to organic guidelines until a farmer can sell produce under the ' bio ' label . " foreign competition adding pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition from latin america is adding to the pressure with the discounters slashing the prices of organic products and foreign growers increasing competition , the consumers are looking like the winners of germany 's " bio-boom " while german farmers are almost certainly on the losing side . " in eastern europe and latin america , there is a focus on producing organic food and the industry is strongly promoted by governments , " spiller said .
" many third world countries also use organic cultivation as they have had little access to fertilizer and pesticides in the past . " hermann heldberg , a health food wholesaler for over 30 years , is just one of a growing number of people in the organic food industry who are calling for the german government to help farmers . " we are behind the likes of the netherlands in producing organic vegetables , " he said .
" it is heavily promoted there and if a dutch firm wants to expand and export its goods to germany , then there is a big market here for them .
but we also can produce cucumbers and peppers .

he has written an autobiography .
he is fighting legal battles against police torture .
he is starting a charitable foundation for children .
at the same time , he is a convicted child murderer . in sept .
2002 , magnus gäfgen kidnapped and murdered jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would choose the children that will receive help from the foundation . " my client is not trying to make money for himself , " heuchemer said . advertisi n g remorse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von metzler was brutally murdered this is not the first time that the enterprising lawyer is working on behalf of his client outside the courtroom .
heuchemer already published gäfgen 's autobiographical work " alone with god , " which gäfgen described as his " attempt at confronting , understanding and overcoming " what happened to him in 2002 . not everybody is convinced that the latest social project of the enterprising lawyer-client duo is exactly praiseworthy . " for young lawyers , it is very tempting to boost their career with such a case , " frank johnigk of the german federal chamber of lawyers told the german weekly der spiegel .
" it seems morally questionable , but legally there are no problems with it . " a n ecessary project ? supporters , on the other hand , like to stress that convicts , too , deserve a chance to truly repent for the crimes they have committed and that they need encouragement along the way . " this is a necessary project , " said joachim schultz-tornau , formerly a prominent politician and member of parliament in the german state of north rhine - westphalia .
" this is a meaningful sign of remorse . " schultz-tornau , who became gäfgen 's mentor in prison , published in 2005 a highly controversial " plea for a murderer , " in which he described gäfgen not as a " merciless killer " but " a human being with likable traits . "
his involvement in the case did not go down very well with his party - the free-market liberal fdp - which ultimately led to schultz-tornau 's exit from the political arena . huma n rights gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner , former frankfurt deputy police chief while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police chief wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court at the time . " with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european court for human rights in strasbourg , france gäfgen and his lawyer , however , thought differently .
gäfgen 's appeals before german courts were not successful , but last year he lodged a complaint against germany with the european human rights court . in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights which stipulate , on the one hand , that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment and , on the other , that everyone has the right to a fair trial . gäfgens liability claim against the state of hessen lead to the suspended sentencing of wolfgang daschner in december 2004 .
the former deputy police chief of the city of frankfurt was fined 10,800 euros for authorizing threats of torture to be used during investigation . gäfgen 's charitable foundation is yet to be approved by the authorities . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de murderer takes case to human rights court the convicted murderer of a prominent banker 's son has lodged a complaint at the european court of human rights over his treatment while in custody .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.08.2006 " germany should be seen as a fair partner by both sides " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict in the middle east has killed and displaced hundreds dw-world.de spoke to oskar lafontaine of germany 's opposition left party about his take on the middle east conflict , the difficulty of criticizing israel and the possibility of germany aligning too closely with the us . oskar lafontaine is the parliamentary chairman of germany 's left party and also served as the social democratic party chairman and german finance minister . dw-world.de : what is the left party 's position on the current conflict in the middle east ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine is head of the parliamentary group of the left party oskar lafontaine : first , we demand an immediate ceasefire because we need to avoid additional civilians being killed , injured or their health being permanently damaged . secondly , we demand all sides involved finally respect international law .
the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .
on the other hand , it 's also our responsibility to criticize the foreign policy of the german government where it 's wrongly used .
that 's why i said that the german government should n't get entangled too deeply in the bush administration 's workings when it comes to its political efforts .
after all , the bush administration has largely squandered its goodwill and reputation in the middle east and the arab world . naser shrouf interviewed oskar lafontaine -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still reticent about involvement in mideast mission they may not have rejected outright israeli leader olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east , but german politicians harbor deep reservations about the controversial proposal .

" the 32-year-old director - whose 2004 hit movie " head on " was the first german film to win the berlin festival 's top prize in 17 years and later same year earned him the european film award - got into trouble after he was seen last week wearing a t-shirt with the last name of united states president george w. bush written on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has many opponents in germany while it is not illegal to wear the name of the us president stamped across your chest in germany , the director 's fashion statement with political implications consisted of a single four-letter word - bush - in which the letter " s " was written in the form of a swastika . " bush 's policies are comparable to those of the third reich , " akin told the german weekly der spiegel .
" i believe that films are being produced in hollywood on behalf of the pentagon in order to normalize things such as torture and guantanamo .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .
on the other hand , it 's also our responsibility to criticize the foreign policy of the german government where it 's wrongly used .
that 's why i said that the german government should n't get entangled too deeply in the bush administration 's workings when it comes to its political efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.08.2006 farmers losing out in german organic boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic farmers in germany ca n't grow enough to meet demand the demand for organic produce in germany has never been higher , now that discount supermarkets are also offering cheaper organic produce .
but german farmers are losing out due to an inability to meet rising demand . with organic products increasing in popularity across the board despite being more expensive , one might think that organic farmers are raking in the profits . but just as " bio-food " takes off in germany 's many discount food chains , farmers are taking a financial hit from the no-frills segment , which is cutting the price of organic produce in line with the rest of the cheap items on offer . for german organic farmers , seeing their eco-friendly products , laboriously grown with care and conscience , on the shelves of discount supermarkets is a bitter pill to swallow .
while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad . " competing farmers in poland , italy , and the czech republic are at an advantage over their german competitors as they receive twice as much in government subsidies .
but in a bid to remain competitive and to keep german stores stocked with organic produce grown in germany , the farmers are facing another dilemma . problems converting to meet demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes three years for a conventional farm to be fully switch to organic the regulations in the organic farming sector concerning growth agents and agricultural techniques are so strict , and the time and costs involved in cultivating bio-produce so demanding , that german farmers find themselves unable to meet the rising demand .
and for conventional farmers looking to convert to organic farming in a bid to profit from that demand , there are also problems . the switch to organic is a costly one for conventional farmers .
a farm beginning to produce organically grown food can expect to earn 60 percent less in revenue at the start of its new business . " the change from conventional to organic farming does not happen overnight , " said achim spiller , professor for agrarian marketing at the university of göttingen .
" it takes at least three years of conforming to organic guidelines until a farmer can sell produce under the ' bio ' label . " foreign competition adding pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition from latin america is adding to the pressure with the discounters slashing the prices of organic products and foreign growers increasing competition , the consumers are looking like the winners of germany 's " bio-boom " while german farmers are almost certainly on the losing side . " in eastern europe and latin america , there is a focus on producing organic food and the industry is strongly promoted by governments , " spiller said .
" many third world countries also use organic cultivation as they have had little access to fertilizer and pesticides in the past . " hermann heldberg , a health food wholesaler for over 30 years , is just one of a growing number of people in the organic food industry who are calling for the german government to help farmers . " we are behind the likes of the netherlands in producing organic vegetables , " he said .
" it is heavily promoted there and if a dutch firm wants to expand and export its goods to germany , then there is a big market here for them .
but we also can produce cucumbers and peppers .

he has written an autobiography .
he is fighting legal battles against police torture .
he is starting a charitable foundation for children .
at the same time , he is a convicted child murderer . in sept .
2002 , magnus gäfgen kidnapped and murdered jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would choose the children that will receive help from the foundation . " my client is not trying to make money for himself , " heuchemer said . advertisi n g remorse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von metzler was brutally murdered this is not the first time that the enterprising lawyer is working on behalf of his client outside the courtroom .
heuchemer already published gäfgen 's autobiographical work " alone with god , " which gäfgen described as his " attempt at confronting , understanding and overcoming " what happened to him in 2002 . not everybody is convinced that the latest social project of the enterprising lawyer-client duo is exactly praiseworthy . " for young lawyers , it is very tempting to boost their career with such a case , " frank johnigk of the german federal chamber of lawyers told the german weekly der spiegel .
" it seems morally questionable , but legally there are no problems with it . " a n ecessary project ? supporters , on the other hand , like to stress that convicts , too , deserve a chance to truly repent for the crimes they have committed and that they need encouragement along the way . " this is a necessary project , " said joachim schultz-tornau , formerly a prominent politician and member of parliament in the german state of north rhine - westphalia .
" this is a meaningful sign of remorse . " schultz-tornau , who became gäfgen 's mentor in prison , published in 2005 a highly controversial " plea for a murderer , " in which he described gäfgen not as a " merciless killer " but " a human being with likable traits . "
his involvement in the case did not go down very well with his party - the free-market liberal fdp - which ultimately led to schultz-tornau 's exit from the political arena . huma n rights gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner , former frankfurt deputy police chief while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police chief wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court at the time . " with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european court for human rights in strasbourg , france gäfgen and his lawyer , however , thought differently .
gäfgen 's appeals before german courts were not successful , but last year he lodged a complaint against germany with the european human rights court . in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights which stipulate , on the one hand , that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment and , on the other , that everyone has the right to a fair trial . gäfgens liability claim against the state of hessen lead to the suspended sentencing of wolfgang daschner in december 2004 .
the former deputy police chief of the city of frankfurt was fined 10,800 euros for authorizing threats of torture to be used during investigation . gäfgen 's charitable foundation is yet to be approved by the authorities . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de murderer takes case to human rights court the convicted murderer of a prominent banker 's son has lodged a complaint at the european court of human rights over his treatment while in custody .

" my client is not trying to make money for himself , " heuchemer said . advertisi n g remorse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von metzler was brutally murdered this is not the first time that the enterprising lawyer is working on behalf of his client outside the courtroom .
heuchemer already published gäfgen 's autobiographical work " alone with god , " which gäfgen described as his " attempt at confronting , understanding and overcoming " what happened to him in 2002 . not everybody is convinced that the latest social project of the enterprising lawyer-client duo is exactly praiseworthy . " for young lawyers , it is very tempting to boost their career with such a case , " frank johnigk of the german federal chamber of lawyers told the german weekly der spiegel .
" it seems morally questionable , but legally there are no problems with it . " a n ecessary project ? supporters , on the other hand , like to stress that convicts , too , deserve a chance to truly repent for the crimes they have committed and that they need encouragement along the way . " this is a necessary project , " said joachim schultz-tornau , formerly a prominent politician and member of parliament in the german state of north rhine - westphalia .
" this is a meaningful sign of remorse . " schultz-tornau , who became gäfgen 's mentor in prison , published in 2005 a highly controversial " plea for a murderer , " in which he described gäfgen not as a " merciless killer " but " a human being with likable traits . "
his involvement in the case did not go down very well with his party - the free-market liberal fdp - which ultimately led to schultz-tornau 's exit from the political arena . huma n rights gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner , former frankfurt deputy police chief while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police chief wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court at the time . " with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european court for human rights in strasbourg , france gäfgen and his lawyer , however , thought differently .
gäfgen 's appeals before german courts were not successful , but last year he lodged a complaint against germany with the european human rights court . in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights which stipulate , on the one hand , that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment and , on the other , that everyone has the right to a fair trial . gäfgens liability claim against the state of hessen lead to the suspended sentencing of wolfgang daschner in december 2004 .
the former deputy police chief of the city of frankfurt was fined 10,800 euros for authorizing threats of torture to be used during investigation . gäfgen 's charitable foundation is yet to be approved by the authorities . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de murderer takes case to human rights court the convicted murderer of a prominent banker 's son has lodged a complaint at the european court of human rights over his treatment while in custody .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .
on the other hand , it 's also our responsibility to criticize the foreign policy of the german government where it 's wrongly used .
that 's why i said that the german government should n't get entangled too deeply in the bush administration 's workings when it comes to its political efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.08.2006 eu proposes new rules to simplify cross-border divorces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what happens if it the fairytale does n't last ?
each year , thousands of international couples file for divorce in the eu – a complicated affair as there are no clear rules on which national laws apply to their divorce .
now , the eu is aiming to simplify matters . with more freedom of movement within the european union have come more cross-border marriages .
but not all of these marriages last a lifetime .
each year , up to 170,000 international couples file for divorce in the eu – representing 16 percent of all separations in europe .
in addition to their personal problems , the divorcing couple is also confronted with a myriad of practical and legal problems exacerbated by the lack of any common eu family law . there are many widely varying legal systems and divorce procedures in the eu 's member states .
in ireland , for example , couples must have a four-year separation period before they can divorce , whereas in finland , a divorce can be obtained in six months .
at present , it is often difficult for international couples – where spouses are either of different nationalities , live in different member states , or have the same nationality but live in a member state other than their state of origin – to know which laws apply to their divorce . additionally , the current situation can lead to " divorce shopping " where one spouse will " rush to court , " said david davidson , head of the family department at leading london law firm charles russell . " due to the enormous difference in the financial relief given to spouses in different eu jurisdictions , inevitably , you ’ re going to have situations where husbands will try to file where wives get less , and wives try to file where wives get more , " davidson said . " one of the consequences of this is that when a marriage hits rocks , rather than sitting down and talking through their problems and seeking to reconcile or deal with things in an amicable fashion , the couple are compelled by these rules to fire the gun as it were , and start the process of dissolution of marriage in order to achieve a tactical advantage . " stopping " divorce shopping " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for justice , freedom and security franco frattini in order to put an end to the practice of divorce shopping , and to lessen the confusion for international couples , the european commission recently adopted two initiatives .
the first seeks new regulations on which laws and jurisdictions are applicable in divorce matters where spouses are of different nationalities .
the second initiative launches a public consultation on applicable law , jurisdiction and recognition in matters of property rights of married and unmarried couples . " these initiatives will simplify life for couples in the eu , " said commissioner for justice , liberty and security franco frattini .
" they will increase legal certainty and enable couples to know which law will apply to their matrimonial property regime and their divorce .
the aim is not to harmonize the national laws on divorce , which are very diverse , but to ensure to ensure legal certainty , flexibility and access to court . " the new regulations would still allow for some degree of divorce shopping , because of " a limited possibility to choose the applicable law and the competent court in divorce proceedings , " according to a commission statement . " this may be particularly useful in cases of divorce by mutual consent , " the statement said . but in cases where the divorce is contested , the new rules would not allow one partner to " rush to court " in countries permitting a quick divorce . " the proposal will reduce the incentive to ' rush to court ' since the applicable law will be designated on the basis of common rules independently of which court is seized , " the commission said . a mammoth task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malta is the only eu country where divorce is not allowed davidson applauded the commission for taking up the thorny issue of international divorces but said there was no way to tell how effective the proposals would be in cutting the confusion . " it is very much a growing problem and i don ’ t envy them finding a solution to it , " he said .
" it is hard enough to achieve a system in any one jurisdiction that is perfect ; trying to do this across 25 states seems near impossible . " the european commission 's proposals are being closely monitored by member states with both conservative and liberal laws on divorce . ireland and poland are keen to guard the catholic values which have led to their restrictive divorce laws , while malta – the only member state that does not permit divorce - is studying the text to make sure divorce is not introduced through the back door . " some member states wanted to make sure people could not circumvent or undermine national laws , " a commission official said .
" concerns were raised in both regards – from those member states with rather restrictive divorce laws but also those with liberal laws . " the proposals will go before the european parliament for its opinion , but whether or not they come into effect will ultimately be decided by the 25 member states , which must agree unanimously .
britain , ireland and denmark have an opt-out clause by which they can refuse to take part in eu policies . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france 's polygamy problem between 150,000 and 400,000 people live in polygamous households in france , in which a man is married to more than one woman .

but german farmers are losing out due to an inability to meet rising demand . with organic products increasing in popularity across the board despite being more expensive , one might think that organic farmers are raking in the profits . but just as " bio-food " takes off in germany 's many discount food chains , farmers are taking a financial hit from the no-frills segment , which is cutting the price of organic produce in line with the rest of the cheap items on offer . for german organic farmers , seeing their eco-friendly products , laboriously grown with care and conscience , on the shelves of discount supermarkets is a bitter pill to swallow .
while they 're happy that more and more organic products are reaching the consumer , they must face up to the realities of dealing with the discounters whose bottom line is : " sell the produce for less or we 'll get it from abroad . " competing farmers in poland , italy , and the czech republic are at an advantage over their german competitors as they receive twice as much in government subsidies .
but in a bid to remain competitive and to keep german stores stocked with organic produce grown in germany , the farmers are facing another dilemma . problems converting to meet demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes three years for a conventional farm to be fully switch to organic the regulations in the organic farming sector concerning growth agents and agricultural techniques are so strict , and the time and costs involved in cultivating bio-produce so demanding , that german farmers find themselves unable to meet the rising demand .
and for conventional farmers looking to convert to organic farming in a bid to profit from that demand , there are also problems . the switch to organic is a costly one for conventional farmers .
a farm beginning to produce organically grown food can expect to earn 60 percent less in revenue at the start of its new business . " the change from conventional to organic farming does not happen overnight , " said achim spiller , professor for agrarian marketing at the university of göttingen .
" it takes at least three years of conforming to organic guidelines until a farmer can sell produce under the ' bio ' label . " foreign competition adding pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition from latin america is adding to the pressure with the discounters slashing the prices of organic products and foreign growers increasing competition , the consumers are looking like the winners of germany 's " bio-boom " while german farmers are almost certainly on the losing side . " in eastern europe and latin america , there is a focus on producing organic food and the industry is strongly promoted by governments , " spiller said .
" many third world countries also use organic cultivation as they have had little access to fertilizer and pesticides in the past . " hermann heldberg , a health food wholesaler for over 30 years , is just one of a growing number of people in the organic food industry who are calling for the german government to help farmers . " we are behind the likes of the netherlands in producing organic vegetables , " he said .
" it is heavily promoted there and if a dutch firm wants to expand and export its goods to germany , then there is a big market here for them .
but we also can produce cucumbers and peppers .

in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .

merkel stressed the resolution contained the right message .

he has written an autobiography .
he is fighting legal battles against police torture .
he is starting a charitable foundation for children .
at the same time , he is a convicted child murderer . in sept .
2002 , magnus gäfgen kidnapped and murdered jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would choose the children that will receive help from the foundation . " my client is not trying to make money for himself , " heuchemer said . advertisi n g remorse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von metzler was brutally murdered this is not the first time that the enterprising lawyer is working on behalf of his client outside the courtroom .
heuchemer already published gäfgen 's autobiographical work " alone with god , " which gäfgen described as his " attempt at confronting , understanding and overcoming " what happened to him in 2002 . not everybody is convinced that the latest social project of the enterprising lawyer-client duo is exactly praiseworthy . " for young lawyers , it is very tempting to boost their career with such a case , " frank johnigk of the german federal chamber of lawyers told the german weekly der spiegel .
" it seems morally questionable , but legally there are no problems with it . " a n ecessary project ? supporters , on the other hand , like to stress that convicts , too , deserve a chance to truly repent for the crimes they have committed and that they need encouragement along the way . " this is a necessary project , " said joachim schultz-tornau , formerly a prominent politician and member of parliament in the german state of north rhine - westphalia .
" this is a meaningful sign of remorse . " schultz-tornau , who became gäfgen 's mentor in prison , published in 2005 a highly controversial " plea for a murderer , " in which he described gäfgen not as a " merciless killer " but " a human being with likable traits . "
his involvement in the case did not go down very well with his party - the free-market liberal fdp - which ultimately led to schultz-tornau 's exit from the political arena . huma n rights gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner , former frankfurt deputy police chief while interrogating gäfgen , deputy police chief wolfgang daschner threatened to have a martial arts expert hurt the suspect if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hid the child , who was already dead at the time . but the fact that local police squeezed a confession out of gäfgen by threatening to torture him was irrelevant , judge hans bachl told the court at the time . " with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " bachl said in his concluding statement .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . " legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european court for human rights in strasbourg , france gäfgen and his lawyer , however , thought differently .
gäfgen 's appeals before german courts were not successful , but last year he lodged a complaint against germany with the european human rights court . in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights which stipulate , on the one hand , that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment and , on the other , that everyone has the right to a fair trial . gäfgens liability claim against the state of hessen lead to the suspended sentencing of wolfgang daschner in december 2004 .
the former deputy police chief of the city of frankfurt was fined 10,800 euros for authorizing threats of torture to be used during investigation . gäfgen 's charitable foundation is yet to be approved by the authorities . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de murderer takes case to human rights court the convicted murderer of a prominent banker 's son has lodged a complaint at the european court of human rights over his treatment while in custody .

both russia and china argued in favor of making the text more attractive to lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli army convoy next to the border with lebanon , in northern israel the chief hurdle is the presence of some 10,000 israeli troops in southern lebanon .
the draft does not call for their withdrawal , which would be left to a follow-up resolution authorizing an international force and setting peace terms . lebanese foreign ministry official nouhad mahmoud told reuters that the current text was " not implementable . " " definitely the intention of those who are working on it is the intention for peace , and that 's why we are telling them that its not adequate that it does not really achieve the objective that they 've set for themselves , " said lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . syrian foreign minister walid muallem also said the un draft resolution to end the conflict was " a recipe for the continuation of war . " the draft resolution - favored by israel and the us - does however call for a " full cessation of hostilities " and says hezbollah must stop all attacks while israel must halt " offensive military operations . "
it also calls on un peacekeepers to monitor the truce and stipulates principles necessary for a permanent political settlement . merkel : resolutio n a n " importa n t step " despite misgivings in the arab world about the us-french draft resolution , leaders elsewhere in europe have welcomed it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has hailed the resolution german chancellor angela merkel called it " an important step towards a halt in military operations . "
merkel stressed the resolution contained the right message . " the accord on a resolution for the middle east is a strong signal by the international community to the parties involved in the conflict , " merkel was quoted by a government spokesman as saying . olmert : " do n ' t preach to us " even as the german government mulls the possibility of sending german peacekeepers to the middle east after an explicit statement to that effect by israeli prime minister ehud olmert in a newspaper interview , the israeli leader took a swipe at european leaders ' heightening concerns about mounting civilian losses in lebanon as a result of israeli strikes . in an interview published sunday in german newspaper welt am so n n tag , olmert told european leaders to stop preaching to him about civilian war casualties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert says europeans have no right to preach to israel " where do they get the right to preach to israel ? "
olmert said .
" european countries attacked kosovo and killed 10,000 civilians .
ten thousand !
and none of these countries had to suffer before that from a single rocket , " he said .
" i 'm not saying it was wrong to intervene in kosovo .
but please : do n't preach to us about the treatment of civilians . " meanwhile , there was no letup in the violence which has killed over 770 people in lebanon , mostly civilians , and over 90 israelis .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .
that 's why the question of whether we can protect our economic interests in the region the way we 'd like to is secondary .
saving the lives of the people who are dying now and those who are threatened by death as long as the war continues is of prime importance . i believe that the german position always works well when it 's considered by all sides involved to be a fair and neutral partner that tries to build fair and honest relationships .
that 's why i believe that it is possible in this conflict to maintain good relations with israel as well as the arab world - the prerequisite is that germany is seen as a fair partner by both sides . do you see germany 's history as a burden in the middle east ? the huge historical guilt that germany has taken upon itself due to the crimes of the nazis can not be erased by not acting in a neutral manner towards the palestinians and the arabs .
instead , we 're all the more responsible for the fate of the palestinians because after all the founding of the state of israel and the displacement of the palestinians can also be traced back to the crimes of the nazis . the german public is increasingly critical of israel in the light of the suffering of the lebanese population .
german politicians on the other hand are more reserved .
where do you see the limits on germany 's criticism of israeli policies ? you must have a clear basis when you judge the acts of others .
international law is part of the clear fundamental principles that the left party represents .
only international law can pave the way towards peace in the middle east .
nobody can be allowed to abuse international law - neither israel nor any of the other parties involved . what can the german opposition parties do to exert more of an influence on the german government 's foreign policy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks and military vehicles on a road along the israeli-lebanese border firstly , it 's the duty of the german opposition to support the foreign policy of the government in a critical manner because it is about representing the interests of our country .
on the other hand , it 's also our responsibility to criticize the foreign policy of the german government where it 's wrongly used .
that 's why i said that the german government should n't get entangled too deeply in the bush administration 's workings when it comes to its political efforts .

the situation in the middle east is very difficult and accusations of blame are being hurled at each other by both sides , but international law has to provide the basis for peace and all parties involved - including the usa , israel and hezbollah - must respect international law in the future .
that 's something that has not happened in the past . thirdly , we 're in favor of an international peacekeeping force that should be stationed on both sides of the border for the parties involved to consider it as neutral . some observers in germany have complained about the german government 's rather passive stance on the conflict .
how do you see the government 's position ? the german government is naturally trying to contribute towards de-escalating the conflict .
but it 's always in danger - and this is our criticism - of tilting too heavily towards the us stance .
it 's common knowledge that the usa is not seen as being neutral , at least in the arab world .
so if the german government toes the american line too closely , it will not be able to make a decisive contribution towards improving conditions in the middle east . do you think germany 's current policy is damaging the interests of germans in the arab world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine says saving lives is the priority we believe that the priority is to save the lives of the people who have been affected by this war .

i would be very happy if germany participated , " olmert told german daily süddeutsche zeitu n g last week .
" i have informed chancellor angela merkel that we have absolutely no problem having german troops in south lebanon . " the israeli leader may have no problem , but germany certainly does . ever since the publication of olmert 's interview , the country is witnessing an intense domestic debate about the rights and wrongs of such a move . the german government has not entirely ruled out sending troops to the middle east . though chancellor angela merkel has rejected any immediate deployment of troops , defense minister franz josef jung said last month that if both sides in the conflict and the international community requested german participation , it would be difficult for berlin to decline . " difficult shared history " but , many citizens and politicians remain uneasy about sending soldiers to the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a synagoge in leipzig - some 110,000 jews live in germany today foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said last month that talks about germany 's involvement in a possible international peacekeeping force on the israeli-lebanon border were being treated with great sensitivity . " i think this is appropriate given the difficult shared history between germany and israel , " he told german broadcaster zdf . few doubt that more than 60 years after world war ii and the holocaust , in which the nazis killed about six million jews , sending german soldiers to the region would be far from controversial . deputy foreign minister gernot erler of the social democratic party ruled out a direct military involvement by german troops " for purely historical reasons . " in an interview with german daily die welt on saturday , erler said german troops could possibly be involved in reconstruction and training the lebanese army and police , but not in firing on israeli troops , if necessary , given germany 's persecution of europe 's jews during its nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli soldier smokes a cigarette at an artillery position near the lebanese border " it 's difficult to imagine german soldiers armed with guns facing off against israelis , " erler said . co n cer n s about n eutrality others have voiced concern that olmert 's explicit mention of a german role in the future peacekeeping mission would work to the country 's disadvantage and would make it make it difficult for germany to stay neutral .
germany will be seen as " partisan " in the eyes of the arab world , said oskar lafontaine of the opposition left party . some have criticized olmert 's statement that an international peacekeeping force would , above all , serve to protect israel from further attacks by the shiite militant group hezbollah instead of securing stability in lebanon after a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . " a peacekeeping force is no ' pro israel ' force , but rather it 's meant to be neutral , " birgit homburger , a defense expert of the opposition free-market liberals , fdp , told news agency reuters . on a more pragmatic note , some german politicians have emphasized that germany 's armed forces are already overstretched with peacekeeping deployments as far away as congo and afghanistan and simply lack the resources to participate in the middle east . " first facts , the n decisio n " though there is almost unanimous agreement that it 's too premature to talk of german participation given the fact that there 's still no un mandate or framework for an international peacekeeping force in the middle east , some believe that olmert 's frank talk may have opened up much-needed debate on what has long been considered taboo . olmert 's wish does show " that all those who have categorically ruled out german participation on historical grounds and thus seized control from us on how to formulate a mandate -lrb- for the peacekeeping force -rrb- have been wrong , " eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told news agency reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fierce fighting still continues on the israeli-lebanon border foreign minister steinmeier called olmert 's wish to see german peacekeepers in the middle east as a " noteworthy proof of trust " and one which made apparent " the extraordinarily good development between israel and germany in the past decades .

he has written an autobiography .
he is fighting legal battles against police torture .
he is starting a charitable foundation for children .
at the same time , he is a convicted child murderer . in sept .
2002 , magnus gäfgen kidnapped and murdered jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would choose the children that will receive help from the foundation . " my client is not trying to make money for himself , " heuchemer said . advertisi n g remorse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von metzler was brutally murdered this is not the first time that the enterprising lawyer is working on behalf of his client outside the courtroom .
heuchemer already published gäfgen 's autobiographical work " alone with god , " which gäfgen described as his " attempt at confronting , understanding and overcoming " what happened to him in 2002 . not everybody is convinced that the latest social project of the enterprising lawyer-client duo is exactly praiseworthy .

2002 , magnus gäfgen kidnapped and murdered jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison . according gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , the 31-year-old convicted murder is now planning to establish a foundation whose goal is to assist children who have been victims of violence . " the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement . the foundation will be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,000 -rrb- .

you want to get a train , but you ca n't see the platform and you ca n't hear the station 's public announcement telling you where to go .
if and when you get to the right platform you ca n't see the button to open the doors and if you do manage to board the train you ca n't see where there is a spare seat in the carriage .
these are just some of the problems facing deafblind people in scotland .
stephen joyce was born profoundly deaf and is now losing his sight . "
before today i would have probably said the person was deaf and dumb , which i now know is wrong " morven cameron first scotrail worker deafblind care ' postcode lottery ' the 33-year-old father-of-one trains first scotrail staff at its training academy in glasgow on how to offer help and support to deafblind rail users .
stephen spoke to the small group of workers through an interpreter using sign language and the interpreter then told them what he said .
he offers training to new staff at first scotrail to illustrate the obstacles faced by deafblind people .
the condition is also known as dual sensory impairment .
i took part in one of stephen 's practical exercises during the training session .
totally disorientated it involved putting in ear plugs and wearing a blindfold so that i could not hear or see anything .
four of us sat round a table with little idea of what was going to happen next .
we were n't told what to do .
a minute later someone grabbed my hand and put it on top of what felt like dominos on the table .
it felt strange to touch something and guess what it was , but not be certain .
i heard a faint voice asking if i wanted tea or coffee , the sound was muffled and difficult to pick up .
i said no and then i was asked if i needed a hand to get off my seat to leave the room .
i said i did and i felt someone lifting me from the chair and moving me to where i thought the door was .
i was totally reliant on the person guiding me .
i was in darkness as the person grabbed my left hand and got me to extend my arm , so that i could feel the wall on my left side .
gingerly , i felt the wall as we moved forward , only for it to disappear as i assumed we must have turned a corner .
finally , i was asked to take off the blindfold and remove the ear plugs .
we were in another room and i found it difficult to see in the sudden light .
stephen said the exercise was designed to show people how and what it felt like to be deafblind .
i felt totally disorientated and at the mercy of the person guiding me .
audio clips the thought of trying to board a train without being able to see or hear properly alarmed me .
things i take for granted , like pressing a button to board a train or finding a spare seat on one of the carriages pose real challenges for deafblind rail users .
another exercise involved listening to about 20 audio clips and trying to decipher what the person was saying .
it was almost impossible to make out the words .
stephen said this was what it sounded like to a deafblind person in the middle of a busy rail station .
first scotrail is liaising with the charity deafblind scotland to help its staff improve their understanding of the condition and the challenges deafblind people face .
deafblind scotland serves about 700 adults who have lost or are losing their sight and hearing .
it said there were about 5,000 people in scotland with a dual sensory impairment .
the most effective way to communicate with deafblind people is using the deafblind manual .
the manual is relatively easy to pick up , deafblind scotland 's jill robertson said .
deafblind manual alphabet is a tactile language , used to communicate with people who have little or no residual sight and hearing .
' engage people ' also known as finger-spelling , this involves forming letter symbols on the palm of a person 's hand .
a person 's five fingers on one hand denote the vowels .
deafblind scotland works with adults who have become dual sensory impaired later in life - which is called acquired deafblindness .
ms robertson said : " we exist to enable deafblind people to do what they want , not do it for them .
" we engage with them and try to integrate them back into society . "
morven cameron , a bookings officer at irvine station , said she found the training rewarding , adding that it made her assess her own views .
" this kind of thing is a brilliant idea , " the 30-year-old from greenock said .
" it makes you more at ease when dealing with a person who is deaf and blind and shows the problems they face .
" before today i would have probably said the person was deaf and dumb , which i now know is wrong .
" this helps me think about what i 'll do the next time a deafblind person comes into the rail station and i 'll be able to help them more confidently . "
first scotrail spokeswoman julie mccomasky said the training was a good way to educate staff on the needs of deafblind rail users .
she said other bodies within the rail industry should consider similar training programmes .

you want to get a train , but you ca n't see the platform and you ca n't hear the station 's public announcement telling you where to go .

i was totally reliant on the person guiding me .
i was in darkness as the person grabbed my left hand and got me to extend my arm , so that i could feel the wall on my left side .
gingerly , i felt the wall as we moved forward , only for it to disappear as i assumed we must have turned a corner .

stephen spoke to the small group of workers through an interpreter using sign language and the interpreter then told them what he said .
he offers training to new staff at first scotrail to illustrate the obstacles faced by deafblind people .
the condition is also known as dual sensory impairment .
i took part in one of stephen 's practical exercises during the training session .

four of us sat round a table with little idea of what was going to happen next .
we were n't told what to do .

it felt strange to touch something and guess what it was , but not be certain .
stephen joyce offers training to rail staff on deafblind people 's needs i heard a faint voice asking if i wanted tea or coffee , the sound was muffled and difficult to pick up .
i said no and then i was asked if i needed a hand to get off my seat to leave the room .
i said i did and i felt someone lifting me from the chair and moving me to where i thought the door was .
i was totally reliant on the person guiding me .
i was in darkness as the person grabbed my left hand and got me to extend my arm , so that i could feel the wall on my left side .
gingerly , i felt the wall as we moved forward , only for it to disappear as i assumed we must have turned a corner .
finally , i was asked to take off the blindfold and remove the ear plugs .
we were in another room and i found it difficult to see in the sudden light .
stephen said the exercise was designed to show people how and what it felt like to be deafblind .
i felt totally disorientated and at the mercy of the person guiding me .
audio clips the thought of trying to board a train without being able to see or hear properly alarmed me .
things i take for granted , like pressing a button to board a train or finding a spare seat on one of the carriages pose real challenges for deafblind rail users .
another exercise involved listening to about 20 audio clips and trying to decipher what the person was saying .
it was almost impossible to make out the words .
stephen said this was what it sounded like to a deafblind person in the middle of a busy rail station .

the most effective way to communicate with deafblind people is using the deafblind manual .
the manual is relatively easy to pick up , deafblind scotland 's jill robertson said .
deafblind manual alphabet is a tactile language , used to communicate with people who have little or no residual sight and hearing .
' engage people ' also known as finger-spelling , this involves forming letter symbols on the palm of a person 's hand .
a person 's five fingers on one hand denote the vowels .
deafblind scotland works with adults who have become dual sensory impaired later in life - which is called acquired deafblindness .
ms robertson said : " we exist to enable deafblind people to do what they want , not do it for them .
" we engage with them and try to integrate them back into society . "
julie mccomasky said the deafblind training was invaluable morven cameron , a bookings officer at irvine station , said she found the training rewarding , adding that it made her assess her own views .

she said other bodies within the rail industry should consider similar training programmes .

the firm , which was hit by a month-long strike earlier this summer , reported profits down 37 % at 387.3bn won -lrb- $ 401.6m ; £ 210.6m -rrb- over the period .
the strong won made hyundai exports - which account for about 60 % of its overall sales - more expensive .
but hyundai shares rose as investors said the won 's impact may have peaked .
the company is embroiled in a bribery and embezzlement scandal which has seen a number of top executives charged .
chairman chung mong-koo , accused of using company money to win political favours , appeared in court on monday .
strike impact hyundai 's results were worse than expected , with exports falling nearly 9 % and domestic sales slipping 1.8 % .
the stronger the won , the lower the profits the firm makes when its overseas earnings are converted back into domestic currency .
although the earnings were n't that good , some investors now think the worst is over choi dai-shik , cj investment & securities .
hyundai has ambitious growth plans , with its eye set on becoming one of the world 's six largest car firms by 2010 .
but its business - like many of korea 's leading companies - has been dogged by industrial relations problems .
a month-long pay dispute which ended late last month is expected to cost the firm $ 1.3bn in lost production .
analysts said the strike would harm the firm 's second-half performance but added that the currency situation should improve .
" although the earnings were n't that good , the results were already priced in and some investors now think the worst is over , boosting hyundai 's shares , " said choi dai-shik , from cj investment & securities .
currency difficulties also hit profits at hyundai-owned kia motors .
the firm saw its profits fall to $ 46m from $ 154m in the corresponding period last year , despite a 5 % increase in sales .

it is estimated the spa with its mineral-enriched waters will bring in around £ 20m of business to the city every year .
" i feel it 's very important for the economy of bath , " said theresa mcdermott , bath chamber of commerce .
in order to break-even on running costs , the spa will need to attract around 250 people each day .
" it 's the only hot spring in the uk and as such it will have world-wide recognition just the same as the spas in germany or hungary and i feel it will be a very big attraction for people coming from overseas to enjoy the facilities , " theresa mcdermott added .
costs rocketed people living in bath and north east somerset will get a 15 % reduction on entry but could get in for free in the future .
the councillor responsible for the spa , nichole o 'flaherty , has said it would cost the authority £ 2.5m a year and that if enough people wanted it , it could be arranged .
for the past 20 or so years the springs - which produce some 1.2 million litres of hot water every day - have been closed to the public .
they were closed in 1978 amid fears over the safety of the water source after a woman died of legionnaires ' disease .
in the intervening years , five attempts were made to rejuvenate and reopen the thermal waters to the public but each eventually failed , until the city hit upon the idea of doing so as a millennium project .
but the project was beset with problems as costs rocketed and squabbles broke out between the authority and the builders , mowlem .
the grand opening will be the first time people in the city - which takes its name from the hot waters - will be able to look around the new facility .

it is estimated the spa with its mineral-enriched waters will bring in around £ 20m of business to the city every year .
" i feel it 's very important for the economy of bath , " said theresa mcdermott , bath chamber of commerce .
in order to break-even on running costs , the spa will need to attract around 250 people each day .
" it 's the only hot spring in the uk and as such it will have world-wide recognition just the same as the spas in germany or hungary and i feel it will be a very big attraction for people coming from overseas to enjoy the facilities , " theresa mcdermott added .
costs rocketed people living in bath and north east somerset will get a 15 % reduction on entry but could get in for free in the future .
the councillor responsible for the spa , nichole o 'flaherty , has said it would cost the authority £ 2.5m a year and that if enough people wanted it , it could be arranged .
for the past 20 or so years the springs - which produce some 1.2 million litres of hot water every day - have been closed to the public .
they were closed in 1978 amid fears over the safety of the water source after a woman died of legionnaires ' disease .
in the intervening years , five attempts were made to rejuvenate and reopen the thermal waters to the public but each eventually failed , until the city hit upon the idea of doing so as a millennium project .
but the project was beset with problems as costs rocketed and squabbles broke out between the authority and the builders , mowlem .
the grand opening will be the first time people in the city - which takes its name from the hot waters - will be able to look around the new facility .

one of the most high-profile is a network operated by search giant google .
while poring over hidden charges on your cell phone bill , or writing hefty cheques to your internet service provider , it 's hard not to think there should be a better way .
anything but high prices and no choices .
well , i 'm starting to think there is , and i caught a glimpse of it in the city of mountain view , california .
in the first week in august i drove down to mountain view on a sweltering afternoon looking to test out the promise of free or cheap phone calls and ubiquitous internet access over a city-wide wi-fi network .
thanks to google , the city has been blanketed by wi-fi , which will soon allow its residents to connect to the wireless internet all over the city for free .
using a technology called mesh , google has placed hundreds of wi-fi nodes on lamp posts around the city that can connect your laptop or handheld device to the internet .
for a town that gets the service , it 's like living in a giant wi-fi hotspot .
similar networks and mountain view is n't the first of its kind .
in 59 other regions in the us , cities and companies have built similar networks , both fee and free-based , according to a research organization called muni wireless .
another 130 city and countywide projects are currently underway .
across the world there is also growing interest in countries from france to china to macedonia and the uk .
q & a : wi-fi explained last year only start-up companies and early-adopters were willing to push the service , and major phone companies like verizon saw the service as a competitive threat .
this year large phone companies like at & t are getting into the business .
in mountain view , the story is a bit different .
there are no other city-wide wi-fi networks in the world yet which are run by the high-flying powerful search giant that calls mountain view its home .
the network has been speculated over for months , and is n't even available to the public yet , though somehow i snagged a place as one of the several hundred " trusted testers " .
for that , i would spend several hours under a tree in a city park , with a laptop and a slew of cell phones , putting the network to task .
important characteristics one of the most important characteristics of a network is its speed .
the faster the connection the better i can download those youtube video clips or itunes music files .
particularly frustrating was the fact that the signal is very weak in people 's homes google has said that the maximum speed of the network is 1mbps - in comparison , a fast dsl connection at my home is 2.5mbps.
so not blazingly fast , but pretty good .
after several tests from different locations , the results were mixed .
in many places the connection was as fast as predicted , but the speed depended entirely on how close i had positioned myself to the node on the closest pole .
too far away from the node , or hampered by a tree , the speed degraded by at least half .
drop into one of the network 's few " dead zones , " where google could not gain access to the light poles , and you 've got nothing .
boost the signal particularly frustrating was the fact that the signal is very weak in people 's homes , without an extra piece of hardware to boost the signal inside .
that 's a shame given indoors internet could replace cable or dsl-connections .
but outdoors i found with enough re-positioning it was easy enough to get a signal with a small amount of effort .
the next step was to test out the phone call functions , perhaps the most disruptive out of all the applications for city-wide wi-fi networks .
phone calls over a wi-fi connection , have the ability to bypass the cellular network and cut expensive cell phone calls completely out of the loop .
this is one reason the traditional phone companies had been fighting tooth and nail to slow down or block the service .
i opened up a piece of software called skype , which was bought by ebay last year for billions of dollars , and enables its millions of users to call each other over laptops and handheld devices for free .
first attempts i put on my headset , connected to my laptop , and placed a call .
for the first two attempts , i could hear my friend , but he could n't hear me .
i moved around a bit and found a better signal .
on the third try i had success , and a free call over a free network .
it just took some effort to get it going .
the next test was placing calls over a handheld wi-fi device , which mimics the ease of use of a traditional cell phone and is better than lugging around your laptop and headset .
i used the nokia 770 internet tablet , running a piece of software called the gizmo project that can send a call over wi-fi and connect to anyone on the regular telephone system .
on my first try i connected easily , but discovered there was a noticeable lag time between when i spoke and the other person heard me .
not enough to abandon the call , but like i was calling halfway around the world .
present-day limitations after several hours grilling google 's mountain view wi-fi network i realised both the power of the service , but also the present-day limitations and youth of the technology .
while the service was ubiquitous throughout the city , it 's not as reliable , as fast , or as easy to use , as my home internet connection or my cell phone .
not yet anyway .
start-up companies and major manufacturers are working on all these issues .
they just take time .
then again , i still ca n't get a cell phone signal on major stretches of a silicon valley freeway .
if i get tired enough of my cell phone bill , or my internet service provider 's pricey broadband package , i know there 's starting to be options out there .
with companies like google , and the hundreds of companies working on products for wi-fi networks , i can already get an alternative today .
i just might have to move to mountain view .

one of the most high-profile is a network operated by search giant google .
while poring over hidden charges on your cell phone bill , or writing hefty cheques to your internet service provider , it 's hard not to think there should be a better way .
anything but high prices and no choices .
well , i 'm starting to think there is , and i caught a glimpse of it in the city of mountain view , california .
in the first week in august i drove down to mountain view on a sweltering afternoon looking to test out the promise of free or cheap phone calls and ubiquitous internet access over a city-wide wi-fi network .
thanks to google , the city has been blanketed by wi-fi , which will soon allow its residents to connect to the wireless internet all over the city for free .
using a technology called mesh , google has placed hundreds of wi-fi nodes on lamp posts around the city that can connect your laptop or handheld device to the internet .
for a town that gets the service , it 's like living in a giant wi-fi hotspot .
similar networks and mountain view is n't the first of its kind .
in 59 other regions in the us , cities and companies have built similar networks , both fee and free-based , according to a research organization called muni wireless .
another 130 city and countywide projects are currently underway .
across the world there is also growing interest in countries from france to china to macedonia and the uk .
q & a : wi-fi explained last year only start-up companies and early-adopters were willing to push the service , and major phone companies like verizon saw the service as a competitive threat .
this year large phone companies like at & t are getting into the business .
in mountain view , the story is a bit different .
there are no other city-wide wi-fi networks in the world yet which are run by the high-flying powerful search giant that calls mountain view its home .
the network has been speculated over for months , and is n't even available to the public yet , though somehow i snagged a place as one of the several hundred " trusted testers " .
for that , i would spend several hours under a tree in a city park , with a laptop and a slew of cell phones , putting the network to task .
important characteristics one of the most important characteristics of a network is its speed .
the faster the connection the better i can download those youtube video clips or itunes music files .
particularly frustrating was the fact that the signal is very weak in people 's homes google has said that the maximum speed of the network is 1mbps - in comparison , a fast dsl connection at my home is 2.5mbps.
so not blazingly fast , but pretty good .
after several tests from different locations , the results were mixed .
in many places the connection was as fast as predicted , but the speed depended entirely on how close i had positioned myself to the node on the closest pole .
too far away from the node , or hampered by a tree , the speed degraded by at least half .
drop into one of the network 's few " dead zones , " where google could not gain access to the light poles , and you 've got nothing .
boost the signal particularly frustrating was the fact that the signal is very weak in people 's homes , without an extra piece of hardware to boost the signal inside .
that 's a shame given indoors internet could replace cable or dsl-connections .
but outdoors i found with enough re-positioning it was easy enough to get a signal with a small amount of effort .
the next step was to test out the phone call functions , perhaps the most disruptive out of all the applications for city-wide wi-fi networks .
phone calls over a wi-fi connection , have the ability to bypass the cellular network and cut expensive cell phone calls completely out of the loop .
this is one reason the traditional phone companies had been fighting tooth and nail to slow down or block the service .
i opened up a piece of software called skype , which was bought by ebay last year for billions of dollars , and enables its millions of users to call each other over laptops and handheld devices for free .
first attempts i put on my headset , connected to my laptop , and placed a call .
for the first two attempts , i could hear my friend , but he could n't hear me .
i moved around a bit and found a better signal .
on the third try i had success , and a free call over a free network .
it just took some effort to get it going .
the next test was placing calls over a handheld wi-fi device , which mimics the ease of use of a traditional cell phone and is better than lugging around your laptop and headset .
i used the nokia 770 internet tablet , running a piece of software called the gizmo project that can send a call over wi-fi and connect to anyone on the regular telephone system .
on my first try i connected easily , but discovered there was a noticeable lag time between when i spoke and the other person heard me .
not enough to abandon the call , but like i was calling halfway around the world .
present-day limitations after several hours grilling google 's mountain view wi-fi network i realised both the power of the service , but also the present-day limitations and youth of the technology .
while the service was ubiquitous throughout the city , it 's not as reliable , as fast , or as easy to use , as my home internet connection or my cell phone .
not yet anyway .

one of the most high-profile is a network operated by search giant google .
while poring over hidden charges on your cell phone bill , or writing hefty cheques to your internet service provider , it 's hard not to think there should be a better way .
anything but high prices and no choices .
well , i 'm starting to think there is , and i caught a glimpse of it in the city of mountain view , california .
in the first week in august i drove down to mountain view on a sweltering afternoon looking to test out the promise of free or cheap phone calls and ubiquitous internet access over a city-wide wi-fi network .
thanks to google , the city has been blanketed by wi-fi , which will soon allow its residents to connect to the wireless internet all over the city for free .
using a technology called mesh , google has placed hundreds of wi-fi nodes on lamp posts around the city that can connect your laptop or handheld device to the internet .
for a town that gets the service , it 's like living in a giant wi-fi hotspot .
similar networks and mountain view is n't the first of its kind .
in 59 other regions in the us , cities and companies have built similar networks , both fee and free-based , according to a research organization called muni wireless .
another 130 city and countywide projects are currently underway .
across the world there is also growing interest in countries from france to china to macedonia and the uk .
q & a : wi-fi explained last year only start-up companies and early-adopters were willing to push the service , and major phone companies like verizon saw the service as a competitive threat .
this year large phone companies like at & t are getting into the business .
in mountain view , the story is a bit different .
there are no other city-wide wi-fi networks in the world yet which are run by the high-flying powerful search giant that calls mountain view its home .
the network has been speculated over for months , and is n't even available to the public yet , though somehow i snagged a place as one of the several hundred " trusted testers " .
for that , i would spend several hours under a tree in a city park , with a laptop and a slew of cell phones , putting the network to task .
important characteristics one of the most important characteristics of a network is its speed .
the faster the connection the better i can download those youtube video clips or itunes music files .
particularly frustrating was the fact that the signal is very weak in people 's homes google has said that the maximum speed of the network is 1mbps - in comparison , a fast dsl connection at my home is 2.5mbps.
so not blazingly fast , but pretty good .
after several tests from different locations , the results were mixed .
in many places the connection was as fast as predicted , but the speed depended entirely on how close i had positioned myself to the node on the closest pole .
too far away from the node , or hampered by a tree , the speed degraded by at least half .
drop into one of the network 's few " dead zones , " where google could not gain access to the light poles , and you 've got nothing .
boost the signal particularly frustrating was the fact that the signal is very weak in people 's homes , without an extra piece of hardware to boost the signal inside .
that 's a shame given indoors internet could replace cable or dsl-connections .
but outdoors i found with enough re-positioning it was easy enough to get a signal with a small amount of effort .
the next step was to test out the phone call functions , perhaps the most disruptive out of all the applications for city-wide wi-fi networks .
phone calls over a wi-fi connection , have the ability to bypass the cellular network and cut expensive cell phone calls completely out of the loop .
this is one reason the traditional phone companies had been fighting tooth and nail to slow down or block the service .
i opened up a piece of software called skype , which was bought by ebay last year for billions of dollars , and enables its millions of users to call each other over laptops and handheld devices for free .
first attempts i put on my headset , connected to my laptop , and placed a call .
for the first two attempts , i could hear my friend , but he could n't hear me .
i moved around a bit and found a better signal .
on the third try i had success , and a free call over a free network .
it just took some effort to get it going .
the next test was placing calls over a handheld wi-fi device , which mimics the ease of use of a traditional cell phone and is better than lugging around your laptop and headset .
i used the nokia 770 internet tablet , running a piece of software called the gizmo project that can send a call over wi-fi and connect to anyone on the regular telephone system .
on my first try i connected easily , but discovered there was a noticeable lag time between when i spoke and the other person heard me .
not enough to abandon the call , but like i was calling halfway around the world .
present-day limitations after several hours grilling google 's mountain view wi-fi network i realised both the power of the service , but also the present-day limitations and youth of the technology .
while the service was ubiquitous throughout the city , it 's not as reliable , as fast , or as easy to use , as my home internet connection or my cell phone .
not yet anyway .
start-up companies and major manufacturers are working on all these issues .
they just take time .
then again , i still ca n't get a cell phone signal on major stretches of a silicon valley freeway .
if i get tired enough of my cell phone bill , or my internet service provider 's pricey broadband package , i know there 's starting to be options out there .
with companies like google , and the hundreds of companies working on products for wi-fi networks , i can already get an alternative today .
i just might have to move to mountain view .

the lincolnshire wildlife trust said several adders had been found after apparently being killed with sticks .
the snakes are also being disturbed by people going off paths to try to have a look at them .
the adder is britain 's only venomous snake .
the trust said the snake 's bite was unlikely to be fatal and they should be left in peace as much as possible .
few deaths rachel shaw , from the wildlife trust , admitted it was ironic the threats to the animals seemed to come from people who were scared of the snakes and people who were interested in them .
she said : " adders are quite timid and only attack when frightened .
they are a declining species and any deaths are very unfortunate .
" it is understandable that people want to see these animals but instead of staying on the paths they start tramping through the vegetation and turning over things to find them .

" i feel really bad for mel , " said the 50-year-old , who insisted the mad max star was " not anti-semitic " .
" people say stupid things when they happen to have a few , " he told gmtv .
" hands deserved to be slapped if you do something stupid , but do n't take it too far . "
swayze is currently performing in guys and dolls in london 's west end .
the actor , who appears alongside former brookside regular claire sweeney in the musical , was forced to postpone his opening night after losing his voice .
' pitbull ' speaking to gmtv 's kate garraway in a pre-recorded interview screened on monday , swayze said " a man -lsb- as -rsb- talented " as gibson would bounce back from his current ignominy .
" you do n't put somebody down like that , " he said .
" when you are a pitbull and you love what you do , that talent will find its way out . "
swayze , who was reportedly considered for gibson 's role in the first lethal weapon film , said they had " been in each other 's lives for a long time " .
gibson , he added , was " a wonderful human being " who should be " allowed to have a stupid moment " .
actress jodie foster has also backed the braveheart director , telling the los angeles times he was " honest , loyal -lsb- and -rsb- kind " .
in a statement released last week , gibson admitted making anti-semitic remarks during his arrest on 28 july but insisted they did not reflect his true feelings .
he is expected to appear in court on drink-driving related charges on 28 september .

" i feel really bad for mel , " said the 50-year-old , who insisted the mad max star was " not anti-semitic " .
" people say stupid things when they happen to have a few , " he told gmtv .
" hands deserved to be slapped if you do something stupid , but do n't take it too far . "
swayze is currently performing in guys and dolls in london 's west end .
the actor , who appears alongside former brookside regular claire sweeney in the musical , was forced to postpone his opening night after losing his voice .
' pitbull ' speaking to gmtv 's kate garraway in a pre-recorded interview screened on monday , swayze said " a man -lsb- as -rsb- talented " as gibson would bounce back from his current ignominy .
actress jodie foster has also spoken out in his defence " you do n't put somebody down like that , " he said .
" when you are a pitbull and you love what you do , that talent will find its way out . "
swayze , who was reportedly considered for gibson 's role in the first lethal weapon film , said they had " been in each other 's lives for a long time " .
gibson , he added , was " a wonderful human being " who should be " allowed to have a stupid moment " .
actress jodie foster has also backed the braveheart director , telling the los angeles times he was " honest , loyal -lsb- and -rsb- kind " .
in a statement released last week , gibson admitted making anti-semitic remarks during his arrest on 28 july but insisted they did not reflect his true feelings .

the singer has an eye firmly on lighting up the charts with her hi-octane sisters-unite anthem .
" i have been away for a while and i wanted to hit the public with a ' bam ! ' in your face ...
i 'm back , " says 27-year-old alesha , whose vocal skills as an mc added power to mis-teeq 's sound .
music producers johnny douglas - who has also worked with kylie minogue - and anders bagge , co-writer on madonna 's current hit get together , have collaborated with alesha on her debut album fired up .
" anders is a crazy guy !
he 's like a bolt of energy , which is how some of my friends would describe me .
i think that 's what helped lipstick become what it is . "
douglas , she explains , has " great pop sense " and was a big influence on her burgeoning solo career .
" i was unsure about which direction i wanted to go in , but johnny really helped me decide what kind of artist i wanted to be , " she says .
" i 'm influenced by so many different styles and i have been able to reflect that in my album .
" my dad is jamaican , so i was brought up on reggae music , while my mum played a lot of james brown . "
alesha wrote most of the songs on the album , which she says is her own take on the music industry .
" there is a superficial level that is not my cup of tea , but when you get past that , start performing with your live band and being creative , it overcomes everything else .
it does n't matter anymore .
' illusions ' " i am aware that there are a lot of illusions in the industry , like fame . "
and alesha got used to fame as one third of the highly successful mis-teeq .
along with sabrina washington and su-elise nash , alesha released two albums - lickin ' on both sides and eye candy - which spawned several top ten hits . "
i would be lying if i said i was n't enjoying being a solo performer " alesha dixon they split in early 2005 with mobo and brit awards under their belts , and were rumoured to be on the verge of signing a deal with a major us label .
despite the split , alesha says she is still friends with her former mis-teeq band members .
" we have so much love for each other .
mis-teeq were not together because we had to be - we wanted to be , " she says .
' very scary ' she admits going it alone was a daunting experience .
" it was very scary - it kind of still is !
i have up and down days .
some days i feel insecure and wish i had the support of the girls .
" but i would be lying if i said i was n't enjoying being a solo performer . "
while alesha has beaten mis-teeq singer sabrina to a solo career , it may not be long before the two are rivals .
sabrina has reinvented herself as puma washington , and is expected to release her own material .
" sabrina has been in miami making a record and has put some of her stuff on myspace , " says alesha .
" su-elise has gone back to college as she wants to open her own dance school - something she 's always wanted to do . "
alesha says husband michael harvey - better-known as harvey from so solid crew - has helped her to deal with the music industry .
" if i get wound up about something he is very good at keeping me relaxed and it 's helpful to have that at home , " she says .
" he 's been through his own strife and it 's good to have someone who can relate to how i 'm feeling .
" i do n't know what i 'd do without him . "

almost 200 people are thought to have died after a river burst its banks and floodwaters swept through the city of dire dawa in the east of the country .
hundreds of homes were destroyed when the dechatu river flooded on saturday .
the local police commissioner said 39 of the dead were young children .
" family members have started burying the dead , " regional police inspector beniam fikru told afp news agency from dire dawa , about 500 km from the capital , addis ababa .
" in some cases , it is very difficult to identify them .
" relatives are reporting that around 300 people are missing , but the search goes on , " he said .
damage floodwaters damaged telephone and electricity lines and cut off the main road to addis ababa , further complicating the rescue efforts .
the floods also swept away vehicles and livestock , and destroyed markets and shops , witnesses said .
over the past two years flooding has afflicted several areas of eastern and southern ethiopia , killing hundreds and displacing hundreds of thousands .
thousands of dire dawa 's estimated 250,000 residents have been displaced by the flooding .
flooding often hits low-lying parts of ethiopia between june and september , when heavy showers fall on regions that are dry for most of the year .
last year at least 200 people were killed - some by crocodiles in the floodwaters - when heavy rains pounded the same region .
the flooding also caused millions of dollars worth of damage , particularly to small farmers .

the warning will pop up if users click on a link to a page known to host spyware or other malicious programs .
the initiative comes out of a larger project cataloguing programs that plague people with unwanted ads , spy on web habits or steal personal data .
google is one of several companies trying to act as an " in-flight adviser " to ensure people stay safe online .
web watch the warnings will be seen by anyone using the search engine who clicks on a link to a site identified as harmful by the stop badware coalition .
google , pc maker lenovo and sun set up this initiative in january 2006 to identify dangerous software and the websites that try to trick people into installing these malicious programs .
dangerous keywords free screensavers bearshare screensavers winmx limewire lime wire free ringtones initially the warnings seen via the search site will be generic and simply alert people to the fact that a site has been flagged as dangerous .
eventually the warnings will become more detailed as stop badware researchers visit harmful sites and analyse how they try to subvert users ' machines .
the warning suggests that people try a different site but if they want to continue to the potentially dangerous webpage google will not stop them .
a research report released in may 2006 looked at the safety of the results returned by a search and found that , on average , 4-6 % of the sites had harmful content on them .
for some keywords , such as " free screensavers " the number of potentially dangerous sites leapt to 64 % .
the keywords are used to entice people to access the website .
the research report was partly sponsored by mcafee 's siteadvisor which also warns people when they are about to visit potentially harmful sites .
another company scansafe has also created the scandoo search engine which overlays its warnings on results produced via google and msn .
" most dodgy websites that have spyware or are infected with viruses come through search , " said eldar tuvey , chief executive of scansafe .
" because they are the ones that people do not know as well and find through searching . "
