" for us , frankfurt is of decisive importance as a financial center , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told the german news agency dpa in an interview . in addition , the deutsche börse business model was highly successful , steinbrück said in response to french objections to the so-called " vertical silo " structure of the frankfurt exchange , incorporating the full range of activities from stock trading to settlement and clearing . steinbrück -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the different sizes of euronext and deutsche börse , the bigger of the two because of its clearing activities , should be considered in any tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the successful deutsche börse model should n't be changed " the market capitalization of deutsche börse must be taken into account in issues of headquarters and personnel , " he said . " stand firm " against france at the same time , the state premier of hesse , roland koch , urged the german government to safeguard german interests in any possible merger .
the business daily handelsblatt quoted a letter from koch to steinbrück , in which the conservative politician urged the minister to " stand firm " against any attempts by france to weaken deutsche börse 's position in a joint company .
a tie-up between frankfurt and euronext , which operates the dutch , belgian , french and portuguese stock exchanges , " remains fundamentally a feasible option , " koch reportedly wrote .
but only on the condition that the frankfurt exchange , with its different divisions and employees , be " wholly safeguarded , " handelsblatt quoted koch 's letter as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is among the germans making a case for frankfurt koch 's comments come in response to recent remarks by french finance minister thierry breton , who had said he wanted to play an " active role " in the talks regarding a tie-up of the european stock exchanges . talks between euronext and deutsche börse have so far run aground on failure to agree on the site of the merged company 's headquarters and on the future structure of the group .
euronext wants the clearing activities excluded from any merger , while deutsche börse refuses to abandon its integrated structure . on wednesday , euronext announced that it had abandoned any thought of acquiring the london stock exchange , following nasdaq 's acquisition of a 15-percent stake in the venerable lse .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says all the credit goes to angela merkel . after years of frosty trans-atlantic relations during gerhard schröder 's chancellorship , the rapport between george w. bush and angela merkel marks what for many is a welcome thaw . when the german leader first visited in january , bush described merkel as " charming , intelligent and freedom-loving . "
this time , he praised her clear thinking and straight-talking - while for her part , merkel said she felt they had developed " an amicable partnership . " us n eeds germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not fooling anyone all this mutual appreciation comes as a stark contrast to the hostility dished out to her predecessor , gerhard schröder .

" for us , frankfurt is of decisive importance as a financial center , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told the german news agency dpa in an interview . in addition , the deutsche börse business model was highly successful , steinbrück said in response to french objections to the so-called " vertical silo " structure of the frankfurt exchange , incorporating the full range of activities from stock trading to settlement and clearing . steinbrück -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the different sizes of euronext and deutsche börse , the bigger of the two because of its clearing activities , should be considered in any tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the successful deutsche börse model should n't be changed " the market capitalization of deutsche börse must be taken into account in issues of headquarters and personnel , " he said . " stand firm " against france at the same time , the state premier of hesse , roland koch , urged the german government to safeguard german interests in any possible merger .
the business daily handelsblatt quoted a letter from koch to steinbrück , in which the conservative politician urged the minister to " stand firm " against any attempts by france to weaken deutsche börse 's position in a joint company .
a tie-up between frankfurt and euronext , which operates the dutch , belgian , french and portuguese stock exchanges , " remains fundamentally a feasible option , " koch reportedly wrote .
but only on the condition that the frankfurt exchange , with its different divisions and employees , be " wholly safeguarded , " handelsblatt quoted koch 's letter as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is among the germans making a case for frankfurt koch 's comments come in response to recent remarks by french finance minister thierry breton , who had said he wanted to play an " active role " in the talks regarding a tie-up of the european stock exchanges . talks between euronext and deutsche börse have so far run aground on failure to agree on the site of the merged company 's headquarters and on the future structure of the group .
euronext wants the clearing activities excluded from any merger , while deutsche börse refuses to abandon its integrated structure . on wednesday , euronext announced that it had abandoned any thought of acquiring the london stock exchange , following nasdaq 's acquisition of a 15-percent stake in the venerable lse .

the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .

the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .
given the state of the nation , it 's a proposal that makes sense .
" looking for a reason for this debate leads us to a depressing answer - the government 's financial woes , " jessen said .
" we can no longer afford the generous social benefits that used to be thought of as a right .
and they might be more drastically cut .
a new outlook is needed , and it has to be drawn from traditional ideas about self-reliance . "
whatever the reasons , bourgeois values , once declared dead , have been reborn .
whether the phenomenon is simply a lifestyle trend or an evolving political movement , talk about a new bourgeois mentality seems to reflect a growing unease and fears that tougher times lie ahead . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .
more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing .

" amid a storm of protests from a long line of church leaders that went all the way up to the vatican , mtv ran a test episode of the show - which features a squat , gun-toting pontiff - to gauge opinion and then broadcasted a panel discussion after the screening . during the airing of the show , which has drawn massive protests wherever it has been shown , from canada to new zealand , mtv urged its viewers to phone in or comment via the internet , saying that the decision to continue with the proposed 10-part series would depend on the reactions of the audience . a statement from mtv said that an official decision by the broadcaster on the future of the show would be made next week . a phone survey was also conducted among viewers between the ages of 14 and 39 .
an mtv source later revealed that 78 percent were in favor of the show . under the title " how far can satire go ? " , members of germany 's catholic youth association , media analysts , politicians , german pop stars and mtv viewers debated the controversial show .
however , the most vehement critics of " popetown " - the archdiocese of munich - failed to attend . diverse panel set up to discuss the boundaries of satire those who did attend included dirk tänzler of the board of directors of the alliance of german catholic youth -lrb- bdkj -rrb- , joachim von gottberg from german television 's regulatory body -lrb- fsf -rrb- , rapper smudo from german band die fantastischen vier and the chairman of the young liberals , johannes vogel . gottberg told the panel that the fsf had watched the show before it was shown and had concluded that " popetown " was not a danger , giving mtv the green light to broadcast .
" nobody believes that this is a representation of reality , ” he said . when asked if the beliefs of children would be damaged or their faith in the church shaken by the show , gottberg said that showing " popetown " at a later time would help to protect younger children between the ages of four and 12 who would not understand the irony of the show . older kids know what reality is , says tv standards boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real pope 's behavior differs greatly from the show 's " every 12-year old knows that the pope is not an immature child-like figure , " he added .

gottberg concluded : " it is unlikely that the show would be pulled just because feelings are hurt .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .
we both wanted to be here in germany .
many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .
new approaches to playing , new formations are always welcome . have you been to berlin before ? yes , a great city .
i went to berlin after the drawing in leipzig .
my first impression of berlin was that it 's a modern city with lots of history in every cranny and it invites you to be reflective .
it 's nice to have such places to play - especially against germany . how far will germany make it in the world cup ? without a doubt , germany is a favorite , like brazil , like argentina , like all the former world cup champions .
the netherlands too .
they have a young , famous team that i like very much . interview by daniel martinez -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : ecuador coming from the south america , ecuador were few people 's choice to make it to germany , considering the likes of brazil , argentina and uruguay were challenging .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .

many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .
new approaches to playing , new formations are always welcome . have you been to berlin before ? yes , a great city .
i went to berlin after the drawing in leipzig .
my first impression of berlin was that it 's a modern city with lots of history in every cranny and it invites you to be reflective .
it 's nice to have such places to play - especially against germany . how far will germany make it in the world cup ? without a doubt , germany is a favorite , like brazil , like argentina , like all the former world cup champions .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .
we both wanted to be here in germany .
many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .
new approaches to playing , new formations are always welcome . have you been to berlin before ? yes , a great city .
i went to berlin after the drawing in leipzig .
my first impression of berlin was that it 's a modern city with lots of history in every cranny and it invites you to be reflective .
it 's nice to have such places to play - especially against germany . how far will germany make it in the world cup ? without a doubt , germany is a favorite , like brazil , like argentina , like all the former world cup champions .

" as the main representative of liberation theology , boff tried to commit the catholic church to defend human rights and protecting the poorest .
his book " church and power " drew the ire of the biggest catholic institutions .
in 1985 , the vatican banned boff from speaking and teaching .
joseph ratzinger was then the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith at the time .
today , he is pope benedict xvi and has just completed the first year of his pontificate .
among other things , boff spoke with dw-world.de about the new pope 's record so far . dw-world.de : i n germa n y , the broadcaster mtv is pla n n i n g to tra n smit shortly a program called " popetow n " a satire o n the pope a n d the vatica n .
what do you thi n k of this ki n d of jokes about religio n a n d religious symbols ? leonardo boff : we live in a world that 's full of conflicts and we search for common elements that allow humanity to live in this common home , planet earth .
all the values and practices that promote this goal must be given encouragement .
everything that divides and ridicules these sources of values , and that 's what religions are , goes against this universal search .
there 's a place in society for satire and humor , but everything has a limit .
especially when that satire touches the values or figures that embody the sacred , like mohammed , the pope , or any other religious leader . could it be that the fact of criticizi n g christia n ity or other religio n s would have repercussio n s i n eve n ts such as those we wit n essed whe n the cartoo n s of mohammed were published ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protesters in london demonstating outside the danish embassy the fundamental law regulating societies is the market .
everything - from sex to the most holy trinity - centers on negotiation . this horse trading of everything in society can lead to satires and expressions that ridicule the authorities being converted into a negotiation .
a society must be able to criticize itself and ask itself where its limits are .
when these are breached , we find there is crime and a breakdown of social cohesion . i n that case , should there be ce n sorship or self-ce n sorship ? it 's not a question of censorship or self-censorship , but simply of laws with which society can define for itself what is permitted and what is not .
for example , today it 's clear that you ca n't make any kind of nazi propaganda or promote terrorism , discrimination against people of color or people with aids .
all these are criminal actions which the law punishes and thereby protects society . it 's important that the ability to criticize oneself be always present but there must always be censorship in societies . do you thi n k there is a n attempt at serious dialog betwee n the east a n d the west or that the word dialog is o n ly used to put out fires whe n there is a crisis ? the western tradition is that of war against the muslims .
christians launched crusades against the muslims who always represented a threat for the europeans .
and there was always a fight for cultural or military dominance between the muslim and christian worlds .
the basic remedy is not dialog .
we must break with this tradition because not doing so could lead us into a wider conflict .
a serious dialog with muslims has to seek common ground and not heighten the differences between the two cultures . is this also the key to resolvi n g the problem of the lack of i n tegratio n of muslim immigra n ts i n europe ? in the west , especially in europe , living with that which is different is always very hard .
it is a culture that accentuates identity with such force that it almost excludes difference .
that was a tragedy for the world , because the colonial powers destroyed the indigenous cultures of latin america .
they enslaved black africans , and submitted the orient , and china , to their own economic interests .
western europe never managed , in its hauteur , to recognize the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim schoolgirls wearing head scarves at a school in bremen , germany but now , it 's different .
there are millions of turks , arabs , immigrants from morocco , from africa , who find themselves in spain , germany , belgium , switzerland .
the dialog has to be carried out on home ground .
this is the test : to know to what extent europe is capable of tolerating difference , multicultural or multi-faith societies , pluralist societies which are not really homogenous , white and christian .
the big challenge for europe is to open itself and show that its culture is not dead , fossilized . is it possible to establish a n " allia n ce of civilizatio n s " i n a world of globalizatio n marked by co n verge n ce amo n g n atio n s , eco n omic blocks a n d eve n cultures ? we have to confront the challenges presented by samuel huntington in his interpretation of globalization - the hypothesis of the clash of civilizations .
this thesis can and must be very polemical , but it contains elements of truth .
for example , one can not deny that there is a confrontation between arab-islamic culture and the culture of western christians .
it is possible , and we have no alternative , to sit down together and establish a few basic rules , a basic ethic of living together . the n ew germa n pope has co n sta n tly stated throughout the first year of his po n tificate his i n te n tio n to establish a dialog with other religio n s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.05.2006 " there 's a place for satire , but everything has a limit " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic theologian leonardo boff has had a difficult relationship with his church while saying that it 's too soon to talk about a " transitional pope , " liberation theologian leonardo boff talked to dw-world.de about benedict xvi , " popetown " and the " clash of civilizations . " as the main representative of liberation theology , boff tried to commit the catholic church to defend human rights and protecting the poorest .
his book " church and power " drew the ire of the biggest catholic institutions .
in 1985 , the vatican banned boff from speaking and teaching .
joseph ratzinger was then the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith at the time .
today , he is pope benedict xvi and has just completed the first year of his pontificate .
among other things , boff spoke with dw-world.de about the new pope 's record so far . dw-world.de : i n germa n y , the broadcaster mtv is pla n n i n g to tra n smit shortly a program called " popetow n " a satire o n the pope a n d the vatica n .
what do you thi n k of this ki n d of jokes about religio n a n d religious symbols ? leonardo boff : we live in a world that 's full of conflicts and we search for common elements that allow humanity to live in this common home , planet earth .
all the values and practices that promote this goal must be given encouragement .
everything that divides and ridicules these sources of values , and that 's what religions are , goes against this universal search .
there 's a place in society for satire and humor , but everything has a limit .
especially when that satire touches the values or figures that embody the sacred , like mohammed , the pope , or any other religious leader . could it be that the fact of criticizi n g christia n ity or other religio n s would have repercussio n s i n eve n ts such as those we wit n essed whe n the cartoo n s of mohammed were published ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protesters in london demonstating outside the danish embassy the fundamental law regulating societies is the market .
everything - from sex to the most holy trinity - centers on negotiation . this horse trading of everything in society can lead to satires and expressions that ridicule the authorities being converted into a negotiation .
a society must be able to criticize itself and ask itself where its limits are .
when these are breached , we find there is crime and a breakdown of social cohesion . i n that case , should there be ce n sorship or self-ce n sorship ? it 's not a question of censorship or self-censorship , but simply of laws with which society can define for itself what is permitted and what is not .
for example , today it 's clear that you ca n't make any kind of nazi propaganda or promote terrorism , discrimination against people of color or people with aids .
all these are criminal actions which the law punishes and thereby protects society . it 's important that the ability to criticize oneself be always present but there must always be censorship in societies . do you thi n k there is a n attempt at serious dialog betwee n the east a n d the west or that the word dialog is o n ly used to put out fires whe n there is a crisis ? the western tradition is that of war against the muslims .
christians launched crusades against the muslims who always represented a threat for the europeans .
and there was always a fight for cultural or military dominance between the muslim and christian worlds .
the basic remedy is not dialog .
we must break with this tradition because not doing so could lead us into a wider conflict .
a serious dialog with muslims has to seek common ground and not heighten the differences between the two cultures . is this also the key to resolvi n g the problem of the lack of i n tegratio n of muslim immigra n ts i n europe ? in the west , especially in europe , living with that which is different is always very hard .
it is a culture that accentuates identity with such force that it almost excludes difference .
that was a tragedy for the world , because the colonial powers destroyed the indigenous cultures of latin america .
they enslaved black africans , and submitted the orient , and china , to their own economic interests .
western europe never managed , in its hauteur , to recognize the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim schoolgirls wearing head scarves at a school in bremen , germany but now , it 's different .
there are millions of turks , arabs , immigrants from morocco , from africa , who find themselves in spain , germany , belgium , switzerland .
the dialog has to be carried out on home ground .
this is the test : to know to what extent europe is capable of tolerating difference , multicultural or multi-faith societies , pluralist societies which are not really homogenous , white and christian .
the big challenge for europe is to open itself and show that its culture is not dead , fossilized . is it possible to establish a n " allia n ce of civilizatio n s " i n a world of globalizatio n marked by co n verge n ce amo n g n atio n s , eco n omic blocks a n d eve n cultures ? we have to confront the challenges presented by samuel huntington in his interpretation of globalization - the hypothesis of the clash of civilizations .
this thesis can and must be very polemical , but it contains elements of truth .
for example , one can not deny that there is a confrontation between arab-islamic culture and the culture of western christians .
it is possible , and we have no alternative , to sit down together and establish a few basic rules , a basic ethic of living together . the n ew germa n pope has co n sta n tly stated throughout the first year of his po n tificate his i n te n tio n to establish a dialog with other religio n s .
what adva n ces do you thi n k be n edict xvi will bri n g about ? pope benedict xvi did something very significant when he visited the muslim mosque in rome .
the gesture said : we need to have a dialog , because the standoff between arab-muslim culture and western culture is very strong and reveals itself like an acute and dangerous situation in the confrontation between palestinians and israelis and like the war in iraq . it is important that christianity , which is the dominant religion in the world , takes the initiative and looks for an encounter with other religions as a basis for political accord .
religious peace must serve as a basis for political peace , for world peace .
possibly , this will be the way forward .

officials have denied it and claim that confirmation of would encourage copycat kidnappings . reinhard silberberg , the head of the german foreign ministry 's crisis team , vehemently denied any ransom paid by the german government to free hostages bräunlich and nitzschke . " the german government will not allow itself to be blackmailed , " silberberg told the leipziger volkszeitu n g newspaper .
" it is a basic principle of the government to reject ransom payments . " deputy foreign minister gernot erler , minister meanwhile urgently warned germans not to travel to iraq . " we hope that the current kidnapping case will make people realize that they should take our warnings seriously , " he told the berli n er zeitu n g daily .
he added that all foreigners in iraq are in danger , and german companies with connections to iraq should employ locals in the country , he said . the hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are leipzig-based engineers who had been working on short-term assignment in iraq .
they returned to germany on wednesday . " kid n appers had crimi n al a n d n ot political motives " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister of state gernot erler erler said the government was certain that bräunlich 's and nitzschke 's kidnappers , who had posed a serious of demands for the germans ' release , had acted out of criminal and not political motives . " it was clear that this kidnapping did not have the support of politicians , " he told the n-tv news channel on wednesday . on wednesday , erler had said the government would not comment on ransom reports for fear of encouraging copycat kidnappings .
wolfgang bosbach , the christian democrat 's deputy floor leader in parliament , warned that copycat actions could occur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.05.2006 middle-class morals make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people these days .
the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .
given the state of the nation , it 's a proposal that makes sense .
" looking for a reason for this debate leads us to a depressing answer - the government 's financial woes , " jessen said .
" we can no longer afford the generous social benefits that used to be thought of as a right .
and they might be more drastically cut .
a new outlook is needed , and it has to be drawn from traditional ideas about self-reliance . "
whatever the reasons , bourgeois values , once declared dead , have been reborn .
whether the phenomenon is simply a lifestyle trend or an evolving political movement , talk about a new bourgeois mentality seems to reflect a growing unease and fears that tougher times lie ahead . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .
more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing .
-lrb- may 2 , 2006 -rrb- conservatism : the new rebellion ?
much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .
we both wanted to be here in germany .
many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .
new approaches to playing , new formations are always welcome . have you been to berlin before ? yes , a great city .
i went to berlin after the drawing in leipzig .
my first impression of berlin was that it 's a modern city with lots of history in every cranny and it invites you to be reflective .
it 's nice to have such places to play - especially against germany . how far will germany make it in the world cup ? without a doubt , germany is a favorite , like brazil , like argentina , like all the former world cup champions .
the netherlands too .
they have a young , famous team that i like very much . interview by daniel martinez -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : ecuador coming from the south america , ecuador were few people 's choice to make it to germany , considering the likes of brazil , argentina and uruguay were challenging .
but they made it to only their second world cup finals .

" amid a storm of protests from a long line of church leaders that went all the way up to the vatican , mtv ran a test episode of the show - which features a squat , gun-toting pontiff - to gauge opinion and then broadcasted a panel discussion after the screening . during the airing of the show , which has drawn massive protests wherever it has been shown , from canada to new zealand , mtv urged its viewers to phone in or comment via the internet , saying that the decision to continue with the proposed 10-part series would depend on the reactions of the audience . a statement from mtv said that an official decision by the broadcaster on the future of the show would be made next week . a phone survey was also conducted among viewers between the ages of 14 and 39 .
an mtv source later revealed that 78 percent were in favor of the show . under the title " how far can satire go ? " , members of germany 's catholic youth association , media analysts , politicians , german pop stars and mtv viewers debated the controversial show .
however , the most vehement critics of " popetown " - the archdiocese of munich - failed to attend . diverse panel set up to discuss the boundaries of satire those who did attend included dirk tänzler of the board of directors of the alliance of german catholic youth -lrb- bdkj -rrb- , joachim von gottberg from german television 's regulatory body -lrb- fsf -rrb- , rapper smudo from german band die fantastischen vier and the chairman of the young liberals , johannes vogel . gottberg told the panel that the fsf had watched the show before it was shown and had concluded that " popetown " was not a danger , giving mtv the green light to broadcast .
" nobody believes that this is a representation of reality , ” he said . when asked if the beliefs of children would be damaged or their faith in the church shaken by the show , gottberg said that showing " popetown " at a later time would help to protect younger children between the ages of four and 12 who would not understand the irony of the show . older kids know what reality is , says tv standards boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real pope 's behavior differs greatly from the show 's " every 12-year old knows that the pope is not an immature child-like figure , " he added .
the pontiff in the show often acts like an offensive child , declaring in one episode that he hates orphans " like the plague " and that receiving them is " really crap . "
gottberg concluded : " it is unlikely that the show would be pulled just because feelings are hurt . " rapper smudo said that the row concerning " popetown " had benefited mtv at the expense of the image of the catholic church and added that if anything should be banned it should be germany 's conservative parties which he felt damaged democracy by attempting to restrict free speech and expression in art . conservative politician joachim herrmann earlier this week filed an injunction against mtv over its advertisement for the show which portrayed an empty cross next to a man with a crown of thorns and bloody wounds giggling in front of his television . the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - which is the sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and is based in bavaria , the current pope 's state of birth - issued its protests to the panel in writing .
" such a program has no place on german television , " wrote csu secretary general markus söder . german catholic youth representative tänzler criticized the show , saying that it " denigrated " the cross and went too far .
" i would recommend that mtv stops its broadcast of this show , " tänzler said , adding that the show was banal and had nothing to do with satire . archdiocese of munich pushes for ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church is undetered by its initial failure to have the show banned after the episode was shown , the archdiocese of munich was considering its next step in its bid to have the show taken off german television , vowing to do all it could to prevent the series - which is available on dvd - from being broadcast . the archdiocese had filed a legal injunction against mtv germany on tuesday in an attempt to block the broadcast of the " blasphemous " cartoon . the bishops in pope benedict xvi 's largely catholic home state of bavaria , southern germany , called the show " a collective insult to practicing catholics " and claimed the dialogues in the dubbed german version of the cartoon were even more blasphemous against the pope and the eucharist than the excerpts available on the internet . mtv offered the single test episode as a compromise solution to the archdiocese 's calls for a complete ban , but the bishops have continued to call for the show to be pulled , calling mtv 's offer " perfidious .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.05.2006 catholic church plots next move as " popetown " airs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church has mtv 's " popetown " cartoon in its sights mtv germany risked incurring further wrath from the catholic church wednesday when it went ahead with the planned broadcasting of a single test episode of the irreverent cartoon series " popetown . " amid a storm of protests from a long line of church leaders that went all the way up to the vatican , mtv ran a test episode of the show - which features a squat , gun-toting pontiff - to gauge opinion and then broadcasted a panel discussion after the screening . during the airing of the show , which has drawn massive protests wherever it has been shown , from canada to new zealand , mtv urged its viewers to phone in or comment via the internet , saying that the decision to continue with the proposed 10-part series would depend on the reactions of the audience . a statement from mtv said that an official decision by the broadcaster on the future of the show would be made next week . a phone survey was also conducted among viewers between the ages of 14 and 39 .
an mtv source later revealed that 78 percent were in favor of the show . under the title " how far can satire go ? " , members of germany 's catholic youth association , media analysts , politicians , german pop stars and mtv viewers debated the controversial show .
however , the most vehement critics of " popetown " - the archdiocese of munich - failed to attend . diverse panel set up to discuss the boundaries of satire those who did attend included dirk tänzler of the board of directors of the alliance of german catholic youth -lrb- bdkj -rrb- , joachim von gottberg from german television 's regulatory body -lrb- fsf -rrb- , rapper smudo from german band die fantastischen vier and the chairman of the young liberals , johannes vogel . gottberg told the panel that the fsf had watched the show before it was shown and had concluded that " popetown " was not a danger , giving mtv the green light to broadcast .
" nobody believes that this is a representation of reality , ” he said . when asked if the beliefs of children would be damaged or their faith in the church shaken by the show , gottberg said that showing " popetown " at a later time would help to protect younger children between the ages of four and 12 who would not understand the irony of the show . older kids know what reality is , says tv standards boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real pope 's behavior differs greatly from the show 's " every 12-year old knows that the pope is not an immature child-like figure , " he added .
the pontiff in the show often acts like an offensive child , declaring in one episode that he hates orphans " like the plague " and that receiving them is " really crap . "
gottberg concluded : " it is unlikely that the show would be pulled just because feelings are hurt . " rapper smudo said that the row concerning " popetown " had benefited mtv at the expense of the image of the catholic church and added that if anything should be banned it should be germany 's conservative parties which he felt damaged democracy by attempting to restrict free speech and expression in art . conservative politician joachim herrmann earlier this week filed an injunction against mtv over its advertisement for the show which portrayed an empty cross next to a man with a crown of thorns and bloody wounds giggling in front of his television . the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - which is the sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and is based in bavaria , the current pope 's state of birth - issued its protests to the panel in writing .
" such a program has no place on german television , " wrote csu secretary general markus söder . german catholic youth representative tänzler criticized the show , saying that it " denigrated " the cross and went too far .
" i would recommend that mtv stops its broadcast of this show , " tänzler said , adding that the show was banal and had nothing to do with satire . archdiocese of munich pushes for ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church is undetered by its initial failure to have the show banned after the episode was shown , the archdiocese of munich was considering its next step in its bid to have the show taken off german television , vowing to do all it could to prevent the series - which is available on dvd - from being broadcast . the archdiocese had filed a legal injunction against mtv germany on tuesday in an attempt to block the broadcast of the " blasphemous " cartoon . the bishops in pope benedict xvi 's largely catholic home state of bavaria , southern germany , called the show " a collective insult to practicing catholics " and claimed the dialogues in the dubbed german version of the cartoon were even more blasphemous against the pope and the eucharist than the excerpts available on the internet . mtv offered the single test episode as a compromise solution to the archdiocese 's calls for a complete ban , but the bishops have continued to call for the show to be pulled , calling mtv 's offer " perfidious .

in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .
we both wanted to be here in germany .
many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .
new approaches to playing , new formations are always welcome . have you been to berlin before ? yes , a great city .
i went to berlin after the drawing in leipzig .
my first impression of berlin was that it 's a modern city with lots of history in every cranny and it invites you to be reflective .
it 's nice to have such places to play - especially against germany . how far will germany make it in the world cup ? without a doubt , germany is a favorite , like brazil , like argentina , like all the former world cup champions .
the netherlands too .
they have a young , famous team that i like very much . interview by daniel martinez -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : ecuador coming from the south america , ecuador were few people 's choice to make it to germany , considering the likes of brazil , argentina and uruguay were challenging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.05.2006 middle-class morals make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people these days .
the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .
given the state of the nation , it 's a proposal that makes sense .
" looking for a reason for this debate leads us to a depressing answer - the government 's financial woes , " jessen said .
" we can no longer afford the generous social benefits that used to be thought of as a right .
and they might be more drastically cut .
a new outlook is needed , and it has to be drawn from traditional ideas about self-reliance . "
whatever the reasons , bourgeois values , once declared dead , have been reborn .
whether the phenomenon is simply a lifestyle trend or an evolving political movement , talk about a new bourgeois mentality seems to reflect a growing unease and fears that tougher times lie ahead . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .

" as the main representative of liberation theology , boff tried to commit the catholic church to defend human rights and protecting the poorest .
his book " church and power " drew the ire of the biggest catholic institutions .
in 1985 , the vatican banned boff from speaking and teaching .
joseph ratzinger was then the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith at the time .
today , he is pope benedict xvi and has just completed the first year of his pontificate .
among other things , boff spoke with dw-world.de about the new pope 's record so far . dw-world.de : i n germa n y , the broadcaster mtv is pla n n i n g to tra n smit shortly a program called " popetow n " a satire o n the pope a n d the vatica n .
what do you thi n k of this ki n d of jokes about religio n a n d religious symbols ? leonardo boff : we live in a world that 's full of conflicts and we search for common elements that allow humanity to live in this common home , planet earth .
all the values and practices that promote this goal must be given encouragement .
everything that divides and ridicules these sources of values , and that 's what religions are , goes against this universal search .
there 's a place in society for satire and humor , but everything has a limit .
especially when that satire touches the values or figures that embody the sacred , like mohammed , the pope , or any other religious leader . could it be that the fact of criticizi n g christia n ity or other religio n s would have repercussio n s i n eve n ts such as those we wit n essed whe n the cartoo n s of mohammed were published ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protesters in london demonstating outside the danish embassy the fundamental law regulating societies is the market .
everything - from sex to the most holy trinity - centers on negotiation . this horse trading of everything in society can lead to satires and expressions that ridicule the authorities being converted into a negotiation .
a society must be able to criticize itself and ask itself where its limits are .
when these are breached , we find there is crime and a breakdown of social cohesion . i n that case , should there be ce n sorship or self-ce n sorship ? it 's not a question of censorship or self-censorship , but simply of laws with which society can define for itself what is permitted and what is not .
for example , today it 's clear that you ca n't make any kind of nazi propaganda or promote terrorism , discrimination against people of color or people with aids .
all these are criminal actions which the law punishes and thereby protects society . it 's important that the ability to criticize oneself be always present but there must always be censorship in societies . do you thi n k there is a n attempt at serious dialog betwee n the east a n d the west or that the word dialog is o n ly used to put out fires whe n there is a crisis ? the western tradition is that of war against the muslims .
christians launched crusades against the muslims who always represented a threat for the europeans .
and there was always a fight for cultural or military dominance between the muslim and christian worlds .
the basic remedy is not dialog .
we must break with this tradition because not doing so could lead us into a wider conflict .
a serious dialog with muslims has to seek common ground and not heighten the differences between the two cultures . is this also the key to resolvi n g the problem of the lack of i n tegratio n of muslim immigra n ts i n europe ? in the west , especially in europe , living with that which is different is always very hard .
it is a culture that accentuates identity with such force that it almost excludes difference .
that was a tragedy for the world , because the colonial powers destroyed the indigenous cultures of latin america .
they enslaved black africans , and submitted the orient , and china , to their own economic interests .
western europe never managed , in its hauteur , to recognize the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim schoolgirls wearing head scarves at a school in bremen , germany but now , it 's different .
there are millions of turks , arabs , immigrants from morocco , from africa , who find themselves in spain , germany , belgium , switzerland .
the dialog has to be carried out on home ground .
this is the test : to know to what extent europe is capable of tolerating difference , multicultural or multi-faith societies , pluralist societies which are not really homogenous , white and christian .
the big challenge for europe is to open itself and show that its culture is not dead , fossilized . is it possible to establish a n " allia n ce of civilizatio n s " i n a world of globalizatio n marked by co n verge n ce amo n g n atio n s , eco n omic blocks a n d eve n cultures ? we have to confront the challenges presented by samuel huntington in his interpretation of globalization - the hypothesis of the clash of civilizations .
this thesis can and must be very polemical , but it contains elements of truth .
for example , one can not deny that there is a confrontation between arab-islamic culture and the culture of western christians .
it is possible , and we have no alternative , to sit down together and establish a few basic rules , a basic ethic of living together . the n ew germa n pope has co n sta n tly stated throughout the first year of his po n tificate his i n te n tio n to establish a dialog with other religio n s .
what adva n ces do you thi n k be n edict xvi will bri n g about ? pope benedict xvi did something very significant when he visited the muslim mosque in rome .
the gesture said : we need to have a dialog , because the standoff between arab-muslim culture and western culture is very strong and reveals itself like an acute and dangerous situation in the confrontation between palestinians and israelis and like the war in iraq . it is important that christianity , which is the dominant religion in the world , takes the initiative and looks for an encounter with other religions as a basis for political accord .
religious peace must serve as a basis for political peace , for world peace .
possibly , this will be the way forward .
i believe that is what pope benedict xvi wanted to make plain and we must support this initiative of macro-ecumenism . geraldo hoffman interviewed leonardo boff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de catholic church to ease ban on condom use one year after the election of pope benedict xvi , the vatican , in a reversal of church doctrine , is prepared to allow the use of condoms to combat aids -lrb- march 24 , 2006 -rrb- pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler . "
now , some critics have changed their tune .
-lrb- april 18 , 2006 -rrb- europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons leading politicians have sharply criticized the escalating violence in the arab world over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed , even as muslim leaders are now calling for calm and restraint .

" as the main representative of liberation theology , boff tried to commit the catholic church to defend human rights and protecting the poorest .
his book " church and power " drew the ire of the biggest catholic institutions .
in 1985 , the vatican banned boff from speaking and teaching .
joseph ratzinger was then the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith at the time .
today , he is pope benedict xvi and has just completed the first year of his pontificate .
among other things , boff spoke with dw-world.de about the new pope 's record so far . dw-world.de : i n germa n y , the broadcaster mtv is pla n n i n g to tra n smit shortly a program called " popetow n " a satire o n the pope a n d the vatica n .
what do you thi n k of this ki n d of jokes about religio n a n d religious symbols ? leonardo boff : we live in a world that 's full of conflicts and we search for common elements that allow humanity to live in this common home , planet earth .
all the values and practices that promote this goal must be given encouragement .
everything that divides and ridicules these sources of values , and that 's what religions are , goes against this universal search .
there 's a place in society for satire and humor , but everything has a limit .
especially when that satire touches the values or figures that embody the sacred , like mohammed , the pope , or any other religious leader . could it be that the fact of criticizi n g christia n ity or other religio n s would have repercussio n s i n eve n ts such as those we wit n essed whe n the cartoo n s of mohammed were published ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protesters in london demonstating outside the danish embassy the fundamental law regulating societies is the market .
everything - from sex to the most holy trinity - centers on negotiation . this horse trading of everything in society can lead to satires and expressions that ridicule the authorities being converted into a negotiation .
a society must be able to criticize itself and ask itself where its limits are .
when these are breached , we find there is crime and a breakdown of social cohesion . i n that case , should there be ce n sorship or self-ce n sorship ? it 's not a question of censorship or self-censorship , but simply of laws with which society can define for itself what is permitted and what is not .
for example , today it 's clear that you ca n't make any kind of nazi propaganda or promote terrorism , discrimination against people of color or people with aids .
all these are criminal actions which the law punishes and thereby protects society . it 's important that the ability to criticize oneself be always present but there must always be censorship in societies . do you thi n k there is a n attempt at serious dialog betwee n the east a n d the west or that the word dialog is o n ly used to put out fires whe n there is a crisis ? the western tradition is that of war against the muslims .
christians launched crusades against the muslims who always represented a threat for the europeans .
and there was always a fight for cultural or military dominance between the muslim and christian worlds .
the basic remedy is not dialog .
we must break with this tradition because not doing so could lead us into a wider conflict .
a serious dialog with muslims has to seek common ground and not heighten the differences between the two cultures . is this also the key to resolvi n g the problem of the lack of i n tegratio n of muslim immigra n ts i n europe ? in the west , especially in europe , living with that which is different is always very hard .
it is a culture that accentuates identity with such force that it almost excludes difference .
that was a tragedy for the world , because the colonial powers destroyed the indigenous cultures of latin america .
they enslaved black africans , and submitted the orient , and china , to their own economic interests .
western europe never managed , in its hauteur , to recognize the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim schoolgirls wearing head scarves at a school in bremen , germany but now , it 's different .
there are millions of turks , arabs , immigrants from morocco , from africa , who find themselves in spain , germany , belgium , switzerland .
the dialog has to be carried out on home ground .
this is the test : to know to what extent europe is capable of tolerating difference , multicultural or multi-faith societies , pluralist societies which are not really homogenous , white and christian .
the big challenge for europe is to open itself and show that its culture is not dead , fossilized . is it possible to establish a n " allia n ce of civilizatio n s " i n a world of globalizatio n marked by co n verge n ce amo n g n atio n s , eco n omic blocks a n d eve n cultures ? we have to confront the challenges presented by samuel huntington in his interpretation of globalization - the hypothesis of the clash of civilizations .
this thesis can and must be very polemical , but it contains elements of truth .
for example , one can not deny that there is a confrontation between arab-islamic culture and the culture of western christians .
it is possible , and we have no alternative , to sit down together and establish a few basic rules , a basic ethic of living together . the n ew germa n pope has co n sta n tly stated throughout the first year of his po n tificate his i n te n tio n to establish a dialog with other religio n s .
what adva n ces do you thi n k be n edict xvi will bri n g about ? pope benedict xvi did something very significant when he visited the muslim mosque in rome .
the gesture said : we need to have a dialog , because the standoff between arab-muslim culture and western culture is very strong and reveals itself like an acute and dangerous situation in the confrontation between palestinians and israelis and like the war in iraq . it is important that christianity , which is the dominant religion in the world , takes the initiative and looks for an encounter with other religions as a basis for political accord .
religious peace must serve as a basis for political peace , for world peace .
possibly , this will be the way forward .

for example , today it 's clear that you ca n't make any kind of nazi propaganda or promote terrorism , discrimination against people of color or people with aids .

and there was always a fight for cultural or military dominance between the muslim and christian worlds .
the basic remedy is not dialog .
we must break with this tradition because not doing so could lead us into a wider conflict .
a serious dialog with muslims has to seek common ground and not heighten the differences between the two cultures . is this also the key to resolvi n g the problem of the lack of i n tegratio n of muslim immigra n ts i n europe ? in the west , especially in europe , living with that which is different is always very hard .
it is a culture that accentuates identity with such force that it almost excludes difference .
that was a tragedy for the world , because the colonial powers destroyed the indigenous cultures of latin america .

there are millions of turks , arabs , immigrants from morocco , from africa , who find themselves in spain , germany , belgium , switzerland .
the dialog has to be carried out on home ground .
this is the test : to know to what extent europe is capable of tolerating difference , multicultural or multi-faith societies , pluralist societies which are not really homogenous , white and christian .
the big challenge for europe is to open itself and show that its culture is not dead , fossilized . is it possible to establish a n " allia n ce of civilizatio n s " i n a world of globalizatio n marked by co n verge n ce amo n g n atio n s , eco n omic blocks a n d eve n cultures ? we have to confront the challenges presented by samuel huntington in his interpretation of globalization - the hypothesis of the clash of civilizations .
this thesis can and must be very polemical , but it contains elements of truth .

" as the main representative of liberation theology , boff tried to commit the catholic church to defend human rights and protecting the poorest .
his book " church and power " drew the ire of the biggest catholic institutions .
in 1985 , the vatican banned boff from speaking and teaching .
joseph ratzinger was then the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith at the time .
today , he is pope benedict xvi and has just completed the first year of his pontificate .
among other things , boff spoke with dw-world.de about the new pope 's record so far . dw-world.de : i n germa n y , the broadcaster mtv is pla n n i n g to tra n smit shortly a program called " popetow n " a satire o n the pope a n d the vatica n .
what do you thi n k of this ki n d of jokes about religio n a n d religious symbols ? leonardo boff : we live in a world that 's full of conflicts and we search for common elements that allow humanity to live in this common home , planet earth .
all the values and practices that promote this goal must be given encouragement .
everything that divides and ridicules these sources of values , and that 's what religions are , goes against this universal search .
there 's a place in society for satire and humor , but everything has a limit .
especially when that satire touches the values or figures that embody the sacred , like mohammed , the pope , or any other religious leader . could it be that the fact of criticizi n g christia n ity or other religio n s would have repercussio n s i n eve n ts such as those we wit n essed whe n the cartoo n s of mohammed were published ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protesters in london demonstating outside the danish embassy the fundamental law regulating societies is the market .
everything - from sex to the most holy trinity - centers on negotiation . this horse trading of everything in society can lead to satires and expressions that ridicule the authorities being converted into a negotiation .
a society must be able to criticize itself and ask itself where its limits are .
when these are breached , we find there is crime and a breakdown of social cohesion . i n that case , should there be ce n sorship or self-ce n sorship ? it 's not a question of censorship or self-censorship , but simply of laws with which society can define for itself what is permitted and what is not .
for example , today it 's clear that you ca n't make any kind of nazi propaganda or promote terrorism , discrimination against people of color or people with aids .
all these are criminal actions which the law punishes and thereby protects society . it 's important that the ability to criticize oneself be always present but there must always be censorship in societies . do you thi n k there is a n attempt at serious dialog betwee n the east a n d the west or that the word dialog is o n ly used to put out fires whe n there is a crisis ? the western tradition is that of war against the muslims .
christians launched crusades against the muslims who always represented a threat for the europeans .
and there was always a fight for cultural or military dominance between the muslim and christian worlds .
the basic remedy is not dialog .
we must break with this tradition because not doing so could lead us into a wider conflict .
a serious dialog with muslims has to seek common ground and not heighten the differences between the two cultures . is this also the key to resolvi n g the problem of the lack of i n tegratio n of muslim immigra n ts i n europe ? in the west , especially in europe , living with that which is different is always very hard .
it is a culture that accentuates identity with such force that it almost excludes difference .
that was a tragedy for the world , because the colonial powers destroyed the indigenous cultures of latin america .
they enslaved black africans , and submitted the orient , and china , to their own economic interests .
western europe never managed , in its hauteur , to recognize the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim schoolgirls wearing head scarves at a school in bremen , germany but now , it 's different .
there are millions of turks , arabs , immigrants from morocco , from africa , who find themselves in spain , germany , belgium , switzerland .
the dialog has to be carried out on home ground .
this is the test : to know to what extent europe is capable of tolerating difference , multicultural or multi-faith societies , pluralist societies which are not really homogenous , white and christian .
the big challenge for europe is to open itself and show that its culture is not dead , fossilized . is it possible to establish a n " allia n ce of civilizatio n s " i n a world of globalizatio n marked by co n verge n ce amo n g n atio n s , eco n omic blocks a n d eve n cultures ? we have to confront the challenges presented by samuel huntington in his interpretation of globalization - the hypothesis of the clash of civilizations .
this thesis can and must be very polemical , but it contains elements of truth .
for example , one can not deny that there is a confrontation between arab-islamic culture and the culture of western christians .
it is possible , and we have no alternative , to sit down together and establish a few basic rules , a basic ethic of living together . the n ew germa n pope has co n sta n tly stated throughout the first year of his po n tificate his i n te n tio n to establish a dialog with other religio n s .

" as the main representative of liberation theology , boff tried to commit the catholic church to defend human rights and protecting the poorest .
his book " church and power " drew the ire of the biggest catholic institutions .
in 1985 , the vatican banned boff from speaking and teaching .
joseph ratzinger was then the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith at the time .
today , he is pope benedict xvi and has just completed the first year of his pontificate .
among other things , boff spoke with dw-world.de about the new pope 's record so far . dw-world.de : i n germa n y , the broadcaster mtv is pla n n i n g to tra n smit shortly a program called " popetow n " a satire o n the pope a n d the vatica n .
what do you thi n k of this ki n d of jokes about religio n a n d religious symbols ? leonardo boff : we live in a world that 's full of conflicts and we search for common elements that allow humanity to live in this common home , planet earth .
all the values and practices that promote this goal must be given encouragement .
everything that divides and ridicules these sources of values , and that 's what religions are , goes against this universal search .
there 's a place in society for satire and humor , but everything has a limit .
especially when that satire touches the values or figures that embody the sacred , like mohammed , the pope , or any other religious leader . could it be that the fact of criticizi n g christia n ity or other religio n s would have repercussio n s i n eve n ts such as those we wit n essed whe n the cartoo n s of mohammed were published ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protesters in london demonstating outside the danish embassy the fundamental law regulating societies is the market .
everything - from sex to the most holy trinity - centers on negotiation . this horse trading of everything in society can lead to satires and expressions that ridicule the authorities being converted into a negotiation .
a society must be able to criticize itself and ask itself where its limits are .
when these are breached , we find there is crime and a breakdown of social cohesion . i n that case , should there be ce n sorship or self-ce n sorship ? it 's not a question of censorship or self-censorship , but simply of laws with which society can define for itself what is permitted and what is not .
for example , today it 's clear that you ca n't make any kind of nazi propaganda or promote terrorism , discrimination against people of color or people with aids .
all these are criminal actions which the law punishes and thereby protects society . it 's important that the ability to criticize oneself be always present but there must always be censorship in societies . do you thi n k there is a n attempt at serious dialog betwee n the east a n d the west or that the word dialog is o n ly used to put out fires whe n there is a crisis ? the western tradition is that of war against the muslims .
christians launched crusades against the muslims who always represented a threat for the europeans .
and there was always a fight for cultural or military dominance between the muslim and christian worlds .
the basic remedy is not dialog .
we must break with this tradition because not doing so could lead us into a wider conflict .
a serious dialog with muslims has to seek common ground and not heighten the differences between the two cultures . is this also the key to resolvi n g the problem of the lack of i n tegratio n of muslim immigra n ts i n europe ? in the west , especially in europe , living with that which is different is always very hard .
it is a culture that accentuates identity with such force that it almost excludes difference .
that was a tragedy for the world , because the colonial powers destroyed the indigenous cultures of latin america .
they enslaved black africans , and submitted the orient , and china , to their own economic interests .
western europe never managed , in its hauteur , to recognize the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim schoolgirls wearing head scarves at a school in bremen , germany but now , it 's different .
there are millions of turks , arabs , immigrants from morocco , from africa , who find themselves in spain , germany , belgium , switzerland .
the dialog has to be carried out on home ground .
this is the test : to know to what extent europe is capable of tolerating difference , multicultural or multi-faith societies , pluralist societies which are not really homogenous , white and christian .
the big challenge for europe is to open itself and show that its culture is not dead , fossilized . is it possible to establish a n " allia n ce of civilizatio n s " i n a world of globalizatio n marked by co n verge n ce amo n g n atio n s , eco n omic blocks a n d eve n cultures ? we have to confront the challenges presented by samuel huntington in his interpretation of globalization - the hypothesis of the clash of civilizations .
this thesis can and must be very polemical , but it contains elements of truth .
for example , one can not deny that there is a confrontation between arab-islamic culture and the culture of western christians .
it is possible , and we have no alternative , to sit down together and establish a few basic rules , a basic ethic of living together . the n ew germa n pope has co n sta n tly stated throughout the first year of his po n tificate his i n te n tio n to establish a dialog with other religio n s .
what adva n ces do you thi n k be n edict xvi will bri n g about ? pope benedict xvi did something very significant when he visited the muslim mosque in rome .
the gesture said : we need to have a dialog , because the standoff between arab-muslim culture and western culture is very strong and reveals itself like an acute and dangerous situation in the confrontation between palestinians and israelis and like the war in iraq . it is important that christianity , which is the dominant religion in the world , takes the initiative and looks for an encounter with other religions as a basis for political accord .
religious peace must serve as a basis for political peace , for world peace .

a seaweed wine is already retailing at 22,50 euros -lrb- $ 28 -rrb- a bottle . the granite depths of the baltic sea are a far cry from the sunny slopes of french vineyards , but bon vivants should n't under-estimate the potential of this unprepossessing corner of the earth .
it 's here that scientists are cultivating what they say is the only vegetable which does n't require freshwater and lends itself perfectly to innovative diets - seaweed .
in a nation famed for its love of cabbage and turnip , that does n't sound as bad as it might elsewhere .
of the world 's 40,000 types of seaweed , the experts - at last in germany - say some 160 are edible .
a staple feature of the asian diet , marine biologists at the alfred wegener institute for polar and ocean research now feel it 's high time that germany woke up to its gourmet possibilities - and have the government on their side with support amounting to 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 127,000 -rrb- tasty - and healthy , too seaweed 's many uses extend far beyond its standard incarnation as a sushi wrap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seaweed as most people know it it might be an acquired taste , but inez linke from the institute says that wine made from brown laminaria saccharina seaweed actually tastes like a fine sherry and is extremely wholesome .
" sommeliers say it 's an intense terroir wine with a marzipan flavor , " she said .
" marine algae contain many minerals , salts , vitamins and proteins that makes it extremely healthy and boosts the immune system , " said linke .
planted in december , the baltic seaweed is matured in water eight meters -lrb- 26 feet -rrb- deep for around six months , and harvested by divers in may and june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.05.2006 middle-class morals make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people these days .
the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .

" amid a storm of protests from a long line of church leaders that went all the way up to the vatican , mtv ran a test episode of the show - which features a squat , gun-toting pontiff - to gauge opinion and then broadcasted a panel discussion after the screening . during the airing of the show , which has drawn massive protests wherever it has been shown , from canada to new zealand , mtv urged its viewers to phone in or comment via the internet , saying that the decision to continue with the proposed 10-part series would depend on the reactions of the audience . a statement from mtv said that an official decision by the broadcaster on the future of the show would be made next week . a phone survey was also conducted among viewers between the ages of 14 and 39 .
an mtv source later revealed that 78 percent were in favor of the show . under the title " how far can satire go ? " , members of germany 's catholic youth association , media analysts , politicians , german pop stars and mtv viewers debated the controversial show .
however , the most vehement critics of " popetown " - the archdiocese of munich - failed to attend . diverse panel set up to discuss the boundaries of satire those who did attend included dirk tänzler of the board of directors of the alliance of german catholic youth -lrb- bdkj -rrb- , joachim von gottberg from german television 's regulatory body -lrb- fsf -rrb- , rapper smudo from german band die fantastischen vier and the chairman of the young liberals , johannes vogel . gottberg told the panel that the fsf had watched the show before it was shown and had concluded that " popetown " was not a danger , giving mtv the green light to broadcast .
" nobody believes that this is a representation of reality , ” he said . when asked if the beliefs of children would be damaged or their faith in the church shaken by the show , gottberg said that showing " popetown " at a later time would help to protect younger children between the ages of four and 12 who would not understand the irony of the show . older kids know what reality is , says tv standards boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real pope 's behavior differs greatly from the show 's " every 12-year old knows that the pope is not an immature child-like figure , " he added .
the pontiff in the show often acts like an offensive child , declaring in one episode that he hates orphans " like the plague " and that receiving them is " really crap . "
gottberg concluded : " it is unlikely that the show would be pulled just because feelings are hurt . " rapper smudo said that the row concerning " popetown " had benefited mtv at the expense of the image of the catholic church and added that if anything should be banned it should be germany 's conservative parties which he felt damaged democracy by attempting to restrict free speech and expression in art . conservative politician joachim herrmann earlier this week filed an injunction against mtv over its advertisement for the show which portrayed an empty cross next to a man with a crown of thorns and bloody wounds giggling in front of his television . the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - which is the sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and is based in bavaria , the current pope 's state of birth - issued its protests to the panel in writing .
" such a program has no place on german television , " wrote csu secretary general markus söder . german catholic youth representative tänzler criticized the show , saying that it " denigrated " the cross and went too far .
" i would recommend that mtv stops its broadcast of this show , " tänzler said , adding that the show was banal and had nothing to do with satire . archdiocese of munich pushes for ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church is undetered by its initial failure to have the show banned after the episode was shown , the archdiocese of munich was considering its next step in its bid to have the show taken off german television , vowing to do all it could to prevent the series - which is available on dvd - from being broadcast . the archdiocese had filed a legal injunction against mtv germany on tuesday in an attempt to block the broadcast of the " blasphemous " cartoon . the bishops in pope benedict xvi 's largely catholic home state of bavaria , southern germany , called the show " a collective insult to practicing catholics " and claimed the dialogues in the dubbed german version of the cartoon were even more blasphemous against the pope and the eucharist than the excerpts available on the internet . mtv offered the single test episode as a compromise solution to the archdiocese 's calls for a complete ban , but the bishops have continued to call for the show to be pulled , calling mtv 's offer " perfidious .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .
we both wanted to be here in germany .
many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .
new approaches to playing , new formations are always welcome . have you been to berlin before ? yes , a great city .
i went to berlin after the drawing in leipzig .
my first impression of berlin was that it 's a modern city with lots of history in every cranny and it invites you to be reflective .
it 's nice to have such places to play - especially against germany . how far will germany make it in the world cup ? without a doubt , germany is a favorite , like brazil , like argentina , like all the former world cup champions .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .
we both wanted to be here in germany .
many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .

" for us , frankfurt is of decisive importance as a financial center , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told the german news agency dpa in an interview . in addition , the deutsche börse business model was highly successful , steinbrück said in response to french objections to the so-called " vertical silo " structure of the frankfurt exchange , incorporating the full range of activities from stock trading to settlement and clearing . steinbrück -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the different sizes of euronext and deutsche börse , the bigger of the two because of its clearing activities , should be considered in any tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the successful deutsche börse model should n't be changed " the market capitalization of deutsche börse must be taken into account in issues of headquarters and personnel , " he said . " stand firm " against france at the same time , the state premier of hesse , roland koch , urged the german government to safeguard german interests in any possible merger .
the business daily handelsblatt quoted a letter from koch to steinbrück , in which the conservative politician urged the minister to " stand firm " against any attempts by france to weaken deutsche börse 's position in a joint company .
a tie-up between frankfurt and euronext , which operates the dutch , belgian , french and portuguese stock exchanges , " remains fundamentally a feasible option , " koch reportedly wrote .
but only on the condition that the frankfurt exchange , with its different divisions and employees , be " wholly safeguarded , " handelsblatt quoted koch 's letter as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is among the germans making a case for frankfurt koch 's comments come in response to recent remarks by french finance minister thierry breton , who had said he wanted to play an " active role " in the talks regarding a tie-up of the european stock exchanges . talks between euronext and deutsche börse have so far run aground on failure to agree on the site of the merged company 's headquarters and on the future structure of the group .
euronext wants the clearing activities excluded from any merger , while deutsche börse refuses to abandon its integrated structure . on wednesday , euronext announced that it had abandoned any thought of acquiring the london stock exchange , following nasdaq 's acquisition of a 15-percent stake in the venerable lse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.05.2006 opinion : merkel knows how to be friendly but firm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the personal affinity is unmistakeable germany 's chancellor has headed to the us for the second time in four months , proving that german-american ties are warmer than they 've been for years .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says all the credit goes to angela merkel . after years of frosty trans-atlantic relations during gerhard schröder 's chancellorship , the rapport between george w. bush and angela merkel marks what for many is a welcome thaw . when the german leader first visited in january , bush described merkel as " charming , intelligent and freedom-loving . "
this time , he praised her clear thinking and straight-talking - while for her part , merkel said she felt they had developed " an amicable partnership . " us n eeds germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not fooling anyone all this mutual appreciation comes as a stark contrast to the hostility dished out to her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
and clearly , it is based on more than just personal affinity .
most significantly , it reflects a broader acknowledgement of the fact that germany , as europe 's largest economy , is as important to the us as the us is to germany . another subtext to german-us ties is washington 's awareness that it may have bitten off more than it can chew in iraq , and now realizes that if it wants a peaceful solution to the iranian nuclear issue , it needs help from germany - as well as india , china and russia .
a " coalition of the willing " is no longer an option , and in this respect , the german chancellor wo n't have so much difficulty persuading washington to travel the diplomatic route as schröder once did . not a mediator what also makes merkel an attractive ally to the us president is her healthy friendship with russia - although merkel has stressed that she is unwilling to play the role of mediator . the chancellor did , however , declare she would do her best to break the deadlock in the stalled world trade talks at the eu-latin america summit in vienna on may 12 - a move that would be in us interests given that bush enjoys little popularity within the ranks of south america 's populist left-wing leaders . quietly co n fide n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun in the oval office for all the bonhomie of merkel 's visit to washington , the german leader consistently came across as quietly confident .
she might like george w. bush , but she does n't kowtow to him . she knows that germany can hold its head high on the international stage , that the world listens to what it has to say , and that even the white house has come to value its approach to solving conflicts within multilateral organizations . the fact that bush has a certain amount of personal respect for merkel is one more advantage , and has certainly helped iron out the many differences in german-us relations which emerged in recent years . the extent of the chancellor 's growing international clout will be demonstrated most effectively when she becomes the first german chancellor to address the annual meeting of the american jewish committee during its 100th anniversary celebrations on thursday . germany is slowly but surely banishing its demons , and angela merkel is doing her bit to make that happen . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's speech before jewish group " key reason " for us trip in the course of her second visit to the united states since taking office , german chancellor angela merkel will address the annual meeting of the american jewish committee , the first german chancellor to do so .

" we ... think that it is essential in this context that the clear resolve of the international community is shown by standing united , by showing cohesion on this matter , " merkel said .
" what is also essential , and indeed crucial in this context is that we try to draw as many partners as possible into the fold to clearly show to the iranians that this is unacceptable .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .
we both wanted to be here in germany .
many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .
new approaches to playing , new formations are always welcome . have you been to berlin before ? yes , a great city .
i went to berlin after the drawing in leipzig .
my first impression of berlin was that it 's a modern city with lots of history in every cranny and it invites you to be reflective .
it 's nice to have such places to play - especially against germany . how far will germany make it in the world cup ? without a doubt , germany is a favorite , like brazil , like argentina , like all the former world cup champions .
the netherlands too .
they have a young , famous team that i like very much . interview by daniel martinez -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : ecuador coming from the south america , ecuador were few people 's choice to make it to germany , considering the likes of brazil , argentina and uruguay were challenging .
but they made it to only their second world cup finals .

" amid a storm of protests from a long line of church leaders that went all the way up to the vatican , mtv ran a test episode of the show - which features a squat , gun-toting pontiff - to gauge opinion and then broadcasted a panel discussion after the screening . during the airing of the show , which has drawn massive protests wherever it has been shown , from canada to new zealand , mtv urged its viewers to phone in or comment via the internet , saying that the decision to continue with the proposed 10-part series would depend on the reactions of the audience . a statement from mtv said that an official decision by the broadcaster on the future of the show would be made next week . a phone survey was also conducted among viewers between the ages of 14 and 39 .
an mtv source later revealed that 78 percent were in favor of the show . under the title " how far can satire go ? " , members of germany 's catholic youth association , media analysts , politicians , german pop stars and mtv viewers debated the controversial show .
however , the most vehement critics of " popetown " - the archdiocese of munich - failed to attend . diverse panel set up to discuss the boundaries of satire those who did attend included dirk tänzler of the board of directors of the alliance of german catholic youth -lrb- bdkj -rrb- , joachim von gottberg from german television 's regulatory body -lrb- fsf -rrb- , rapper smudo from german band die fantastischen vier and the chairman of the young liberals , johannes vogel . gottberg told the panel that the fsf had watched the show before it was shown and had concluded that " popetown " was not a danger , giving mtv the green light to broadcast .
" nobody believes that this is a representation of reality , ” he said . when asked if the beliefs of children would be damaged or their faith in the church shaken by the show , gottberg said that showing " popetown " at a later time would help to protect younger children between the ages of four and 12 who would not understand the irony of the show . older kids know what reality is , says tv standards boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real pope 's behavior differs greatly from the show 's " every 12-year old knows that the pope is not an immature child-like figure , " he added .
the pontiff in the show often acts like an offensive child , declaring in one episode that he hates orphans " like the plague " and that receiving them is " really crap . "
gottberg concluded : " it is unlikely that the show would be pulled just because feelings are hurt . " rapper smudo said that the row concerning " popetown " had benefited mtv at the expense of the image of the catholic church and added that if anything should be banned it should be germany 's conservative parties which he felt damaged democracy by attempting to restrict free speech and expression in art . conservative politician joachim herrmann earlier this week filed an injunction against mtv over its advertisement for the show which portrayed an empty cross next to a man with a crown of thorns and bloody wounds giggling in front of his television . the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - which is the sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and is based in bavaria , the current pope 's state of birth - issued its protests to the panel in writing .
" such a program has no place on german television , " wrote csu secretary general markus söder . german catholic youth representative tänzler criticized the show , saying that it " denigrated " the cross and went too far .
" i would recommend that mtv stops its broadcast of this show , " tänzler said , adding that the show was banal and had nothing to do with satire . archdiocese of munich pushes for ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church is undetered by its initial failure to have the show banned after the episode was shown , the archdiocese of munich was considering its next step in its bid to have the show taken off german television , vowing to do all it could to prevent the series - which is available on dvd - from being broadcast . the archdiocese had filed a legal injunction against mtv germany on tuesday in an attempt to block the broadcast of the " blasphemous " cartoon . the bishops in pope benedict xvi 's largely catholic home state of bavaria , southern germany , called the show " a collective insult to practicing catholics " and claimed the dialogues in the dubbed german version of the cartoon were even more blasphemous against the pope and the eucharist than the excerpts available on the internet . mtv offered the single test episode as a compromise solution to the archdiocese 's calls for a complete ban , but the bishops have continued to call for the show to be pulled , calling mtv 's offer " perfidious .

" these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment , is simply absurd , " advisor john bellinger said in brussels .
" many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation ... forensic evidence . " last week an italian member of the european parliament , claudio fava , said the us central intelligence agency had carried out more than 1,000 secret flights in europe since 2001 without any eu governments raising questions . i n vestigatio n harmi n g tra n satla n tic relatio n ship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu report said over 1,000 cia flights crossed european airspace " the suggestion that the flights themselves are somehow engaged in illegal activity really undermines the cooperation between the us and europe , " bellinger said .
" responsible european government officials simply need to say this has gotten out of hand . " the united states has come under intense fire over the last year following press reports that the cia had made several flights across european airspace since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks . the prisoners were reported mainly to have been transited through europe to third countries in a process known as " rendition . " bellinger did acknowledge that some of these flights had taken place . " there have not been thousands of flights , " he said .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition . " eu lawmakers are scheduled to arrive in washington next week to look into allegations of secret terror prisons and flights in europe .
bellinger is among the american officials they will meet . re n ditio n practiced by us a n d other cou n tries on wednesday , us attorney general alberto gonzales said the united states has the right to send prisoners to other countries but it also has the legal obligation to ensure they were not dispatched to places where they would be tortured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said the accusations were important issues for transatlantic relations " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries , " gonzales said .
" it is a practice that certainly has been exercised or used by this administration and previous us administrations . " the us would not transfer people to a country where it is more than likely they would be tortured , gonzales added . the council of europe , largely a human rights watchdog , has been investigating the allegations , as has a european parliament special committee . on tuesday , eu foreign policy envoy javier solana told the parliamentary inquiry he had no certain information about the flights , and that he did not have the power to demand that eu member states provide details about them . " i have no information - no information whatsoever - that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , et cetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

" for us , frankfurt is of decisive importance as a financial center , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told the german news agency dpa in an interview . in addition , the deutsche börse business model was highly successful , steinbrück said in response to french objections to the so-called " vertical silo " structure of the frankfurt exchange , incorporating the full range of activities from stock trading to settlement and clearing . steinbrück -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the different sizes of euronext and deutsche börse , the bigger of the two because of its clearing activities , should be considered in any tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the successful deutsche börse model should n't be changed " the market capitalization of deutsche börse must be taken into account in issues of headquarters and personnel , " he said .

a tie-up between frankfurt and euronext , which operates the dutch , belgian , french and portuguese stock exchanges , " remains fundamentally a feasible option , " koch reportedly wrote .

a seaweed wine is already retailing at 22,50 euros -lrb- $ 28 -rrb- a bottle . the granite depths of the baltic sea are a far cry from the sunny slopes of french vineyards , but bon vivants should n't under-estimate the potential of this unprepossessing corner of the earth .
it 's here that scientists are cultivating what they say is the only vegetable which does n't require freshwater and lends itself perfectly to innovative diets - seaweed .
in a nation famed for its love of cabbage and turnip , that does n't sound as bad as it might elsewhere .
of the world 's 40,000 types of seaweed , the experts - at last in germany - say some 160 are edible .
a staple feature of the asian diet , marine biologists at the alfred wegener institute for polar and ocean research now feel it 's high time that germany woke up to its gourmet possibilities - and have the government on their side with support amounting to 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 127,000 -rrb- tasty - and healthy , too seaweed 's many uses extend far beyond its standard incarnation as a sushi wrap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seaweed as most people know it it might be an acquired taste , but inez linke from the institute says that wine made from brown laminaria saccharina seaweed actually tastes like a fine sherry and is extremely wholesome .
" sommeliers say it 's an intense terroir wine with a marzipan flavor , " she said .
" marine algae contain many minerals , salts , vitamins and proteins that makes it extremely healthy and boosts the immune system , " said linke .
planted in december , the baltic seaweed is matured in water eight meters -lrb- 26 feet -rrb- deep for around six months , and harvested by divers in may and june .
linke says the wine already has a growing fan base of connoisseurs and chefs , who use it in cocktails and haute cuisine , and she now hopes to sell the wine throughout europe and the rest of the world . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life beyond frankfurters ?

" these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment , is simply absurd , " advisor john bellinger said in brussels .
" many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation ... forensic evidence . " last week an italian member of the european parliament , claudio fava , said the us central intelligence agency had carried out more than 1,000 secret flights in europe since 2001 without any eu governments raising questions . i n vestigatio n harmi n g tra n satla n tic relatio n ship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu report said over 1,000 cia flights crossed european airspace " the suggestion that the flights themselves are somehow engaged in illegal activity really undermines the cooperation between the us and europe , " bellinger said .
" responsible european government officials simply need to say this has gotten out of hand . " the united states has come under intense fire over the last year following press reports that the cia had made several flights across european airspace since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks . the prisoners were reported mainly to have been transited through europe to third countries in a process known as " rendition . " bellinger did acknowledge that some of these flights had taken place . " there have not been thousands of flights , " he said .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition . " eu lawmakers are scheduled to arrive in washington next week to look into allegations of secret terror prisons and flights in europe .
bellinger is among the american officials they will meet . re n ditio n practiced by us a n d other cou n tries on wednesday , us attorney general alberto gonzales said the united states has the right to send prisoners to other countries but it also has the legal obligation to ensure they were not dispatched to places where they would be tortured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said the accusations were important issues for transatlantic relations " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries , " gonzales said .
" it is a practice that certainly has been exercised or used by this administration and previous us administrations . " the us would not transfer people to a country where it is more than likely they would be tortured , gonzales added . the council of europe , largely a human rights watchdog , has been investigating the allegations , as has a european parliament special committee . on tuesday , eu foreign policy envoy javier solana told the parliamentary inquiry he had no certain information about the flights , and that he did not have the power to demand that eu member states provide details about them . " i have no information - no information whatsoever - that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , et cetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.05.2006 middle-class morals make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people these days .
the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .
given the state of the nation , it 's a proposal that makes sense .
" looking for a reason for this debate leads us to a depressing answer - the government 's financial woes , " jessen said .
" we can no longer afford the generous social benefits that used to be thought of as a right .
and they might be more drastically cut .
a new outlook is needed , and it has to be drawn from traditional ideas about self-reliance . "
whatever the reasons , bourgeois values , once declared dead , have been reborn .
whether the phenomenon is simply a lifestyle trend or an evolving political movement , talk about a new bourgeois mentality seems to reflect a growing unease and fears that tougher times lie ahead . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .
more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing .
-lrb- may 2 , 2006 -rrb- conservatism : the new rebellion ?
much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?
-lrb- may 27 , 2005 -rrb- germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

" for us , frankfurt is of decisive importance as a financial center , " german finance minister peer steinbrück told the german news agency dpa in an interview . in addition , the deutsche börse business model was highly successful , steinbrück said in response to french objections to the so-called " vertical silo " structure of the frankfurt exchange , incorporating the full range of activities from stock trading to settlement and clearing . steinbrück -lrb- photo -rrb- said that the different sizes of euronext and deutsche börse , the bigger of the two because of its clearing activities , should be considered in any tie-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the successful deutsche börse model should n't be changed " the market capitalization of deutsche börse must be taken into account in issues of headquarters and personnel , " he said . " stand firm " against france at the same time , the state premier of hesse , roland koch , urged the german government to safeguard german interests in any possible merger .
the business daily handelsblatt quoted a letter from koch to steinbrück , in which the conservative politician urged the minister to " stand firm " against any attempts by france to weaken deutsche börse 's position in a joint company .
a tie-up between frankfurt and euronext , which operates the dutch , belgian , french and portuguese stock exchanges , " remains fundamentally a feasible option , " koch reportedly wrote .
but only on the condition that the frankfurt exchange , with its different divisions and employees , be " wholly safeguarded , " handelsblatt quoted koch 's letter as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is among the germans making a case for frankfurt koch 's comments come in response to recent remarks by french finance minister thierry breton , who had said he wanted to play an " active role " in the talks regarding a tie-up of the european stock exchanges . talks between euronext and deutsche börse have so far run aground on failure to agree on the site of the merged company 's headquarters and on the future structure of the group .
euronext wants the clearing activities excluded from any merger , while deutsche börse refuses to abandon its integrated structure . on wednesday , euronext announced that it had abandoned any thought of acquiring the london stock exchange , following nasdaq 's acquisition of a 15-percent stake in the venerable lse .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .
we both wanted to be here in germany .
many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .
new approaches to playing , new formations are always welcome . have you been to berlin before ? yes , a great city .
i went to berlin after the drawing in leipzig .
my first impression of berlin was that it 's a modern city with lots of history in every cranny and it invites you to be reflective .
it 's nice to have such places to play - especially against germany . how far will germany make it in the world cup ? without a doubt , germany is a favorite , like brazil , like argentina , like all the former world cup champions .
the netherlands too .
they have a young , famous team that i like very much . interview by daniel martinez -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : ecuador coming from the south america , ecuador were few people 's choice to make it to germany , considering the likes of brazil , argentina and uruguay were challenging .

luis fernando suarez thinks so luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup . dw-world.de : in the world cup group stage , ecuador faces two manageable opponents , poland and costa rica .
germany may prove to be a more formidable rival .
would you agree ? luis fernando suarez : i do n't think the group is out of the ordinary .
it 's only difficult if you 're not well prepared .
the fact is that we must only consider ourselves .
being dependent on the others , that would be a problem .
we know that it will take a lot of hard work to make it to the next round .
but we also know that we have earned the chance to take part in the world cup . before the drawing in leipzig you said that germany was the only team you did n't want to play against . and that shows there are some things you should n't say out loud !
actually that was n't really my wish .
i get asked so often about possible opponents that sometimes i just have to name a team and germany was a logical choice as the host country . how far will ecuador make it in the world cup ?
i am hopeful that the team will make it past the first round , after that we 'll see .
the people in ecuador will be satisfied with that .
but i want more .
i would like to see the team place in the top eight .
i know how difficult that is , but i also know my troop - their diligence , their potential , their will .
we can do it . what does ecuador have going for them that will help them secure a position as one of the eight best teams in the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecudor 's team is all about group spirit having a strong community and the conviction that our strength lies in our tactical sense of togetherness .
we have no star , no player who can just decide the outcome of a game by himself , or can save the team .
without someone like that , we all learn the value of unity .
sticking together is our strength . you often emphasize how important it is for ecuador to stick together .
how is this evident ? there are situations that symbolize this attitude .
for example , all the players are part of the offense , so that we can move things forward more efficiently .
and when we have to play defensively , it 's just the same .
tactically , ecuador is very talented . many coaches see ecuador as a strong opponent and would n't put it past them to cause an upset at the world cup . that 's because they consider us unpredictable . ecuador hasn ’ t written world cup history yet and for the others we 're outsiders .
if we make it past the first round , it will definitely surprise everyone .
are we a formidable opponent ?
yes , no one who plays against us will have it easy .
we play aggressively and we know what to do with the ball .
ecuador has many positive things to show , but i do n't want to talk about that because i might start sounding like a politician .
it 's not about what we say but about what ecuador will do on the field . where is ecuador 's strength ? it 's not so easy to describe a team like ecuador .
let 's just say , our eleven are technically very talented , and we 're very quick on the attack . where can ecuador improve ? the lack of experience playing against europeans .
there are not very many ecuadorians who have played in europe and that 's why the first few minutes against these opponents will be hard for us .
but we 're not worried .
by the world cup , we 'll know how to play against germans and poles . is n't it a paradox that at the world cup you will have to come up against one of your best friends , alexandre guimaraes , costa rica 's coach ? that is completely normal .
we both wanted to be here in germany .
many people do n't achieve that .
so it 's not a paradox but something we both strived for . what does luis fernando suarez dream of when he thinks about the world cup ? germany is my first world cup .
i am on the way to international recognition , which i already have in latin america .
a good world cup will bring me closer to this goal . as far as soccer is concerned , what will ecuador contribute to the world cup ? it depends on how far we get .
if we lose in the first round , then nothing .
but if we manage to stay , we will show the world that a new soccer power has developed in latin america , in addition to argentina and brazil . what can the fans look forward to at the world cup ? i hope that the teams will show us lots of interesting things for the positive development of soccer .
new approaches to playing , new formations are always welcome . have you been to berlin before ? yes , a great city .
i went to berlin after the drawing in leipzig .
my first impression of berlin was that it 's a modern city with lots of history in every cranny and it invites you to be reflective .
it 's nice to have such places to play - especially against germany . how far will germany make it in the world cup ? without a doubt , germany is a favorite , like brazil , like argentina , like all the former world cup champions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.05.2006 middle-class morals make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people these days .
the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .
given the state of the nation , it 's a proposal that makes sense .
" looking for a reason for this debate leads us to a depressing answer - the government 's financial woes , " jessen said .
" we can no longer afford the generous social benefits that used to be thought of as a right .
and they might be more drastically cut .
a new outlook is needed , and it has to be drawn from traditional ideas about self-reliance . "
whatever the reasons , bourgeois values , once declared dead , have been reborn .
whether the phenomenon is simply a lifestyle trend or an evolving political movement , talk about a new bourgeois mentality seems to reflect a growing unease and fears that tougher times lie ahead . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .
more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing .

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

" we ... think that it is essential in this context that the clear resolve of the international community is shown by standing united , by showing cohesion on this matter , " merkel said .

" amid a storm of protests from a long line of church leaders that went all the way up to the vatican , mtv ran a test episode of the show - which features a squat , gun-toting pontiff - to gauge opinion and then broadcasted a panel discussion after the screening . during the airing of the show , which has drawn massive protests wherever it has been shown , from canada to new zealand , mtv urged its viewers to phone in or comment via the internet , saying that the decision to continue with the proposed 10-part series would depend on the reactions of the audience . a statement from mtv said that an official decision by the broadcaster on the future of the show would be made next week . a phone survey was also conducted among viewers between the ages of 14 and 39 .
an mtv source later revealed that 78 percent were in favor of the show . under the title " how far can satire go ? " , members of germany 's catholic youth association , media analysts , politicians , german pop stars and mtv viewers debated the controversial show .
however , the most vehement critics of " popetown " - the archdiocese of munich - failed to attend . diverse panel set up to discuss the boundaries of satire those who did attend included dirk tänzler of the board of directors of the alliance of german catholic youth -lrb- bdkj -rrb- , joachim von gottberg from german television 's regulatory body -lrb- fsf -rrb- , rapper smudo from german band die fantastischen vier and the chairman of the young liberals , johannes vogel . gottberg told the panel that the fsf had watched the show before it was shown and had concluded that " popetown " was not a danger , giving mtv the green light to broadcast .
" nobody believes that this is a representation of reality , ” he said . when asked if the beliefs of children would be damaged or their faith in the church shaken by the show , gottberg said that showing " popetown " at a later time would help to protect younger children between the ages of four and 12 who would not understand the irony of the show . older kids know what reality is , says tv standards boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real pope 's behavior differs greatly from the show 's " every 12-year old knows that the pope is not an immature child-like figure , " he added .
the pontiff in the show often acts like an offensive child , declaring in one episode that he hates orphans " like the plague " and that receiving them is " really crap . "
gottberg concluded : " it is unlikely that the show would be pulled just because feelings are hurt . " rapper smudo said that the row concerning " popetown " had benefited mtv at the expense of the image of the catholic church and added that if anything should be banned it should be germany 's conservative parties which he felt damaged democracy by attempting to restrict free speech and expression in art . conservative politician joachim herrmann earlier this week filed an injunction against mtv over its advertisement for the show which portrayed an empty cross next to a man with a crown of thorns and bloody wounds giggling in front of his television . the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - which is the sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union and is based in bavaria , the current pope 's state of birth - issued its protests to the panel in writing .
" such a program has no place on german television , " wrote csu secretary general markus söder . german catholic youth representative tänzler criticized the show , saying that it " denigrated " the cross and went too far .
" i would recommend that mtv stops its broadcast of this show , " tänzler said , adding that the show was banal and had nothing to do with satire . archdiocese of munich pushes for ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church is undetered by its initial failure to have the show banned after the episode was shown , the archdiocese of munich was considering its next step in its bid to have the show taken off german television , vowing to do all it could to prevent the series - which is available on dvd - from being broadcast . the archdiocese had filed a legal injunction against mtv germany on tuesday in an attempt to block the broadcast of the " blasphemous " cartoon . the bishops in pope benedict xvi 's largely catholic home state of bavaria , southern germany , called the show " a collective insult to practicing catholics " and claimed the dialogues in the dubbed german version of the cartoon were even more blasphemous against the pope and the eucharist than the excerpts available on the internet . mtv offered the single test episode as a compromise solution to the archdiocese 's calls for a complete ban , but the bishops have continued to call for the show to be pulled , calling mtv 's offer " perfidious .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.05.2006 middle-class morals make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people these days .
the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .
given the state of the nation , it 's a proposal that makes sense .
" looking for a reason for this debate leads us to a depressing answer - the government 's financial woes , " jessen said .
" we can no longer afford the generous social benefits that used to be thought of as a right .
and they might be more drastically cut .
a new outlook is needed , and it has to be drawn from traditional ideas about self-reliance . "
whatever the reasons , bourgeois values , once declared dead , have been reborn .
whether the phenomenon is simply a lifestyle trend or an evolving political movement , talk about a new bourgeois mentality seems to reflect a growing unease and fears that tougher times lie ahead . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .

the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .
given the state of the nation , it 's a proposal that makes sense .
" looking for a reason for this debate leads us to a depressing answer - the government 's financial woes , " jessen said .
" we can no longer afford the generous social benefits that used to be thought of as a right .
and they might be more drastically cut .
a new outlook is needed , and it has to be drawn from traditional ideas about self-reliance . "
whatever the reasons , bourgeois values , once declared dead , have been reborn .
whether the phenomenon is simply a lifestyle trend or an evolving political movement , talk about a new bourgeois mentality seems to reflect a growing unease and fears that tougher times lie ahead . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.05.2006 us official : europe 's allegations on cia flights " absurd " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assuming all the flights had prisoners aboard is " absurd , " according to the us the united states hit back thursday at allegations that the cia had flown thousands of planes with suspects aboard through europe to countries where they might be tortured , as claimed by two european investigations . with the investigations into secret flights carrying detainees in the us war on terror ongoing , a legal advisor to us secretary of state condoleezza rice dismissed the claims as absurd . " these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment , is simply absurd , " advisor john bellinger said in brussels .
" many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation ... forensic evidence . " last week an italian member of the european parliament , claudio fava , said the us central intelligence agency had carried out more than 1,000 secret flights in europe since 2001 without any eu governments raising questions . i n vestigatio n harmi n g tra n satla n tic relatio n ship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu report said over 1,000 cia flights crossed european airspace " the suggestion that the flights themselves are somehow engaged in illegal activity really undermines the cooperation between the us and europe , " bellinger said .
" responsible european government officials simply need to say this has gotten out of hand . " the united states has come under intense fire over the last year following press reports that the cia had made several flights across european airspace since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks . the prisoners were reported mainly to have been transited through europe to third countries in a process known as " rendition . " bellinger did acknowledge that some of these flights had taken place . " there have not been thousands of flights , " he said .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition . " eu lawmakers are scheduled to arrive in washington next week to look into allegations of secret terror prisons and flights in europe .
bellinger is among the american officials they will meet . re n ditio n practiced by us a n d other cou n tries on wednesday , us attorney general alberto gonzales said the united states has the right to send prisoners to other countries but it also has the legal obligation to ensure they were not dispatched to places where they would be tortured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said the accusations were important issues for transatlantic relations " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries , " gonzales said .
" it is a practice that certainly has been exercised or used by this administration and previous us administrations . " the us would not transfer people to a country where it is more than likely they would be tortured , gonzales added . the council of europe , largely a human rights watchdog , has been investigating the allegations , as has a european parliament special committee . on tuesday , eu foreign policy envoy javier solana told the parliamentary inquiry he had no certain information about the flights , and that he did not have the power to demand that eu member states provide details about them . " i have no information - no information whatsoever - that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations , allegations , rumors , et cetera that have taken place in the last year 's time are true , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers probe macedonia 's role in cia prisoner affair european lawmakers probing allegations that cia planes secretly transported prisoners through european countries are in macedonia to investigate the role of the balkan nation .
-lrb- april 28 , 2006 -rrb- eu lawmaker : over 1,000 secret cia flights crossed europe the cia has carried out more than 1,000 secret flights in europe since 2001 without governments raising questions , an eu lawmaker trying to shed light on alleged kidnappings claimed wednesday .
-lrb- april 26 , 2006 -rrb- germany accused of accepting information gained under torture a former british ambassador to uzbekistan turned up the heat on germany thursday when he told a european parliament committee that germany had received information " most certainly obtained under torture " in uzbekistan .

" as the main representative of liberation theology , boff tried to commit the catholic church to defend human rights and protecting the poorest .
his book " church and power " drew the ire of the biggest catholic institutions .
in 1985 , the vatican banned boff from speaking and teaching .

for example , today it 's clear that you ca n't make any kind of nazi propaganda or promote terrorism , discrimination against people of color or people with aids .
all these are criminal actions which the law punishes and thereby protects society . it 's important that the ability to criticize oneself be always present but there must always be censorship in societies . do you thi n k there is a n attempt at serious dialog betwee n the east a n d the west or that the word dialog is o n ly used to put out fires whe n there is a crisis ? the western tradition is that of war against the muslims .

and there was always a fight for cultural or military dominance between the muslim and christian worlds .
the basic remedy is not dialog .
we must break with this tradition because not doing so could lead us into a wider conflict .

the dialog has to be carried out on home ground .
this is the test : to know to what extent europe is capable of tolerating difference , multicultural or multi-faith societies , pluralist societies which are not really homogenous , white and christian .

" as the main representative of liberation theology , boff tried to commit the catholic church to defend human rights and protecting the poorest .
his book " church and power " drew the ire of the biggest catholic institutions .
in 1985 , the vatican banned boff from speaking and teaching .
joseph ratzinger was then the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith at the time .
today , he is pope benedict xvi and has just completed the first year of his pontificate .
among other things , boff spoke with dw-world.de about the new pope 's record so far . dw-world.de : i n germa n y , the broadcaster mtv is pla n n i n g to tra n smit shortly a program called " popetow n " a satire o n the pope a n d the vatica n .
what do you thi n k of this ki n d of jokes about religio n a n d religious symbols ? leonardo boff : we live in a world that 's full of conflicts and we search for common elements that allow humanity to live in this common home , planet earth .
all the values and practices that promote this goal must be given encouragement .
everything that divides and ridicules these sources of values , and that 's what religions are , goes against this universal search .
there 's a place in society for satire and humor , but everything has a limit .
especially when that satire touches the values or figures that embody the sacred , like mohammed , the pope , or any other religious leader . could it be that the fact of criticizi n g christia n ity or other religio n s would have repercussio n s i n eve n ts such as those we wit n essed whe n the cartoo n s of mohammed were published ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protesters in london demonstating outside the danish embassy the fundamental law regulating societies is the market .
everything - from sex to the most holy trinity - centers on negotiation . this horse trading of everything in society can lead to satires and expressions that ridicule the authorities being converted into a negotiation .
a society must be able to criticize itself and ask itself where its limits are .
when these are breached , we find there is crime and a breakdown of social cohesion . i n that case , should there be ce n sorship or self-ce n sorship ? it 's not a question of censorship or self-censorship , but simply of laws with which society can define for itself what is permitted and what is not .
for example , today it 's clear that you ca n't make any kind of nazi propaganda or promote terrorism , discrimination against people of color or people with aids .
all these are criminal actions which the law punishes and thereby protects society . it 's important that the ability to criticize oneself be always present but there must always be censorship in societies . do you thi n k there is a n attempt at serious dialog betwee n the east a n d the west or that the word dialog is o n ly used to put out fires whe n there is a crisis ? the western tradition is that of war against the muslims .
christians launched crusades against the muslims who always represented a threat for the europeans .
and there was always a fight for cultural or military dominance between the muslim and christian worlds .
the basic remedy is not dialog .
we must break with this tradition because not doing so could lead us into a wider conflict .
a serious dialog with muslims has to seek common ground and not heighten the differences between the two cultures . is this also the key to resolvi n g the problem of the lack of i n tegratio n of muslim immigra n ts i n europe ? in the west , especially in europe , living with that which is different is always very hard .
it is a culture that accentuates identity with such force that it almost excludes difference .
that was a tragedy for the world , because the colonial powers destroyed the indigenous cultures of latin america .
they enslaved black africans , and submitted the orient , and china , to their own economic interests .
western europe never managed , in its hauteur , to recognize the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim schoolgirls wearing head scarves at a school in bremen , germany but now , it 's different .
there are millions of turks , arabs , immigrants from morocco , from africa , who find themselves in spain , germany , belgium , switzerland .
the dialog has to be carried out on home ground .
this is the test : to know to what extent europe is capable of tolerating difference , multicultural or multi-faith societies , pluralist societies which are not really homogenous , white and christian .
the big challenge for europe is to open itself and show that its culture is not dead , fossilized . is it possible to establish a n " allia n ce of civilizatio n s " i n a world of globalizatio n marked by co n verge n ce amo n g n atio n s , eco n omic blocks a n d eve n cultures ? we have to confront the challenges presented by samuel huntington in his interpretation of globalization - the hypothesis of the clash of civilizations .
this thesis can and must be very polemical , but it contains elements of truth .
for example , one can not deny that there is a confrontation between arab-islamic culture and the culture of western christians .
it is possible , and we have no alternative , to sit down together and establish a few basic rules , a basic ethic of living together . the n ew germa n pope has co n sta n tly stated throughout the first year of his po n tificate his i n te n tio n to establish a dialog with other religio n s .
what adva n ces do you thi n k be n edict xvi will bri n g about ? pope benedict xvi did something very significant when he visited the muslim mosque in rome .
the gesture said : we need to have a dialog , because the standoff between arab-muslim culture and western culture is very strong and reveals itself like an acute and dangerous situation in the confrontation between palestinians and israelis and like the war in iraq . it is important that christianity , which is the dominant religion in the world , takes the initiative and looks for an encounter with other religions as a basis for political accord .
religious peace must serve as a basis for political peace , for world peace .

" these allegations that there have been thousands of flights with the implication that they all have got detainees on them and worse , detainees bound for mistreatment , is simply absurd , " advisor john bellinger said in brussels .
" many of these flights that have occurred may be carrying analysts , officials engaged in counter-terrorism cooperation ... forensic evidence . " last week an italian member of the european parliament , claudio fava , said the us central intelligence agency had carried out more than 1,000 secret flights in europe since 2001 without any eu governments raising questions . i n vestigatio n harmi n g tra n satla n tic relatio n ship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu report said over 1,000 cia flights crossed european airspace " the suggestion that the flights themselves are somehow engaged in illegal activity really undermines the cooperation between the us and europe , " bellinger said .
" responsible european government officials simply need to say this has gotten out of hand . " the united states has come under intense fire over the last year following press reports that the cia had made several flights across european airspace since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks . the prisoners were reported mainly to have been transited through europe to third countries in a process known as " rendition . " bellinger did acknowledge that some of these flights had taken place . " there have not been thousands of flights , " he said .
" there have been , as we have said , very few cases of rendition . " eu lawmakers are scheduled to arrive in washington next week to look into allegations of secret terror prisons and flights in europe .
bellinger is among the american officials they will meet . re n ditio n practiced by us a n d other cou n tries on wednesday , us attorney general alberto gonzales said the united states has the right to send prisoners to other countries but it also has the legal obligation to ensure they were not dispatched to places where they would be tortured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said the accusations were important issues for transatlantic relations " rendition is an activity that is practiced by the united states and other countries , " gonzales said .
" it is a practice that certainly has been exercised or used by this administration and previous us administrations .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says all the credit goes to angela merkel . after years of frosty trans-atlantic relations during gerhard schröder 's chancellorship , the rapport between george w. bush and angela merkel marks what for many is a welcome thaw . when the german leader first visited in january , bush described merkel as " charming , intelligent and freedom-loving . "
this time , he praised her clear thinking and straight-talking - while for her part , merkel said she felt they had developed " an amicable partnership . " us n eeds germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not fooling anyone all this mutual appreciation comes as a stark contrast to the hostility dished out to her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
and clearly , it is based on more than just personal affinity .
most significantly , it reflects a broader acknowledgement of the fact that germany , as europe 's largest economy , is as important to the us as the us is to germany . another subtext to german-us ties is washington 's awareness that it may have bitten off more than it can chew in iraq , and now realizes that if it wants a peaceful solution to the iranian nuclear issue , it needs help from germany - as well as india , china and russia .
a " coalition of the willing " is no longer an option , and in this respect , the german chancellor wo n't have so much difficulty persuading washington to travel the diplomatic route as schröder once did . not a mediator what also makes merkel an attractive ally to the us president is her healthy friendship with russia - although merkel has stressed that she is unwilling to play the role of mediator . the chancellor did , however , declare she would do her best to break the deadlock in the stalled world trade talks at the eu-latin america summit in vienna on may 12 - a move that would be in us interests given that bush enjoys little popularity within the ranks of south america 's populist left-wing leaders . quietly co n fide n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun in the oval office for all the bonhomie of merkel 's visit to washington , the german leader consistently came across as quietly confident .
she might like george w. bush , but she does n't kowtow to him . she knows that germany can hold its head high on the international stage , that the world listens to what it has to say , and that even the white house has come to value its approach to solving conflicts within multilateral organizations . the fact that bush has a certain amount of personal respect for merkel is one more advantage , and has certainly helped iron out the many differences in german-us relations which emerged in recent years . the extent of the chancellor 's growing international clout will be demonstrated most effectively when she becomes the first german chancellor to address the annual meeting of the american jewish committee during its 100th anniversary celebrations on thursday . germany is slowly but surely banishing its demons , and angela merkel is doing her bit to make that happen . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's speech before jewish group " key reason " for us trip in the course of her second visit to the united states since taking office , german chancellor angela merkel will address the annual meeting of the american jewish committee , the first german chancellor to do so .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says all the credit goes to angela merkel . after years of frosty trans-atlantic relations during gerhard schröder 's chancellorship , the rapport between george w. bush and angela merkel marks what for many is a welcome thaw . when the german leader first visited in january , bush described merkel as " charming , intelligent and freedom-loving .

most significantly , it reflects a broader acknowledgement of the fact that germany , as europe 's largest economy , is as important to the us as the us is to germany . another subtext to german-us ties is washington 's awareness that it may have bitten off more than it can chew in iraq , and now realizes that if it wants a peaceful solution to the iranian nuclear issue , it needs help from germany - as well as india , china and russia .

she might like george w. bush , but she does n't kowtow to him . she knows that germany can hold its head high on the international stage , that the world listens to what it has to say , and that even the white house has come to value its approach to solving conflicts within multilateral organizations . the fact that bush has a certain amount of personal respect for merkel is one more advantage , and has certainly helped iron out the many differences in german-us relations which emerged in recent years . the extent of the chancellor 's growing international clout will be demonstrated most effectively when she becomes the first german chancellor to address the annual meeting of the american jewish committee during its 100th anniversary celebrations on thursday . germany is slowly but surely banishing its demons , and angela merkel is doing her bit to make that happen . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's speech before jewish group " key reason " for us trip in the course of her second visit to the united states since taking office , german chancellor angela merkel will address the annual meeting of the american jewish committee , the first german chancellor to do so .

she might like george w. bush , but she does n't kowtow to him . she knows that germany can hold its head high on the international stage , that the world listens to what it has to say , and that even the white house has come to value its approach to solving conflicts within multilateral organizations . the fact that bush has a certain amount of personal respect for merkel is one more advantage , and has certainly helped iron out the many differences in german-us relations which emerged in recent years . the extent of the chancellor 's growing international clout will be demonstrated most effectively when she becomes the first german chancellor to address the annual meeting of the american jewish committee during its 100th anniversary celebrations on thursday . germany is slowly but surely banishing its demons , and angela merkel is doing her bit to make that happen . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's speech before jewish group " key reason " for us trip in the course of her second visit to the united states since taking office , german chancellor angela merkel will address the annual meeting of the american jewish committee , the first german chancellor to do so .

the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .
given the state of the nation , it 's a proposal that makes sense .
" looking for a reason for this debate leads us to a depressing answer - the government 's financial woes , " jessen said .
" we can no longer afford the generous social benefits that used to be thought of as a right .
and they might be more drastically cut .
a new outlook is needed , and it has to be drawn from traditional ideas about self-reliance . "
whatever the reasons , bourgeois values , once declared dead , have been reborn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.05.2006 middle-class morals make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people these days .
the new conservatism is a topic that regularly features in the lifestyle pages of germany 's newspapers .
rebellion is out , and bourgeois living is in .
is it a sign of the times ? fashion magazines might be busy hailing the new ladylike chic , but judging by berlin 's hippest neighborhoods , not everyone has caught on to the trend yet .
the capital has n't quite given up its love-affair with dressed-down grunge , with the prim looks that have been dominating the catwalks for the last few seasons still resolutely restricted to the government district , if anywhere .
but there is some evidence of a changing mood in a city famed for its anti-authoritarian cool .
experts , however , say that technically speaking , the bourgeoisie no longer exists in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times are tough , material values matter more than ever " bourgeois elements of society disappeared after world war ii and were taken up by the middle class , " said trend scout peter wippermann .
" bourgeois values have been pushed in the last two or three years as a new lifestyle .
trends which are rooted in the bourgeois era have been re-examined and re-interpreted . " a retreat from eco n omic gloom trend scouts and marketing experts say the renaissance of bourgeois styles has primarily economic roots .
with unemployment rife , the renewed popularity of fine silverware and expensive home furnishings reflects a desire to seek comfort in cozy , old-fashioned living .
in what could be seen as a similar retreat from the harsh reality of contemporary life , courses in etiquette and ballroom dancing are suddenly in demand , while increasingly urgent calls for more elite schools suggest that people are tired of being egalitarian and dreaming of position and privilege . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of the past but what 's driving this new interest in bourgeois values ?
is it all just a retro fad ?
an affirmation of neo-conservatism - or a longing for orientation in times of social and economic uncertainty ?
" behind it all there 's a well-founded fear of decline by the middle class , " said jens jessen , a journalist with the weekly die zeit .
" whenever people fear decline , they try to acquire as many attributes as they can to define themselves in society .
the focus is of course not on decline , but rather on background .
so people are acquiring things that they previously thought of as unnecessary . " he also suspects bourgeois habits have reappeared as a way for people to set themselves apart from others .
" i 'd say bourgeois values have simply become a lifestyle choice , " wippermann said .
" it 's not about labeling in the traditional sociological sense , but the fact is , we 're developing a class-oriented society whose divisions will grow in the future . " politically loaded but there 's another , more politically charged dimension to the debate .
the more reactionary commentators interpret the revival of bourgeois tastes as a celebration of old-school virtues , and are keen to see this translated into a political agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteering as an old-fashioned value emphasizing traditional values such as discipline and community spirit , many conservatives are calling for a more civic-minded society in germany - one in which people get involved and take on more responsibility in the form of volunteer work and community service projects .
given the state of the nation , it 's a proposal that makes sense .
" looking for a reason for this debate leads us to a depressing answer - the government 's financial woes , " jessen said .
" we can no longer afford the generous social benefits that used to be thought of as a right .
and they might be more drastically cut .
a new outlook is needed , and it has to be drawn from traditional ideas about self-reliance . "
whatever the reasons , bourgeois values , once declared dead , have been reborn .
whether the phenomenon is simply a lifestyle trend or an evolving political movement , talk about a new bourgeois mentality seems to reflect a growing unease and fears that tougher times lie ahead . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .

the decision by bolivian leader evo morales , announced on monday , has alarmed argentina and brazil , who both have a major stake in bolivian gas .
but mr chavez - an ally of mr morales - said he congratulated his decision and hoped to " learn from bolivia 's wisdom " .
leaders from the four countries are to meet in argentina later on thursday .
the meeting was reportedly arranged after a conversation between brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva and his argentine counterpart , nestor kirchner , on tuesday .
brazil is the biggest investor in bolivian gas and also its biggest consumer , followed by argentina .
meanwhile , a one-day strike planned to protest at mr morales ' decision in the eastern city of santa cruz has been called off .
' risky move ' mr morales said on monday that private energy companies must review contracts and sell their controlling stakes in his country 's gas fields to his government . "
with good will , morales will reach the agreements he needs to make with the foreign companies " hugo chavez venezuelan president bolivia alarms powerful allies send us your comments the move follows from his election campaign pledge to give poorer bolivians , most of them indigenous people from the andean highlands , a bigger share in the country 's energy wealth .
the approach is backed mr chavez , seen as a mentor to mr morales , who negotiated similarly tough deals with global oil giants .
however , bbc brazil correspondent steve kingstone says the bolivian leader is nonetheless taking a risk .
multi-national gas companies have invested more than £ 3bn in bolivia and if they do not trust the government , they may take their business elsewhere .
' deep concern ' brazil 's state-owned energy company , petrobras , is the biggest investor in bolivia 's gas fields .
the brazilian government said on tuesday it respected bolivian sovereignty but added that it would negotiate firmly and calmly to preserve the interests of petrobras .

our correspondent says the two presidents are friends and brazilian leader lula prides himself on his negotiating skills .
but , he says , with brazil 's reliance on bolivia for half its natural gas , the stakes are high , especially as lula is seeking re-election later this year .
spain 's repsol ypf is also a big player in bolivia , and the spanish government has expressed " deep concern " at the move .
the spanish deputy prime minister said mr morales ' actions could deter foreign investment in bolivia .
mr morales has said the gas fields are " just the beginning , because tomorrow it will be the mines , the forest resources and the land " .
the fate of bolivia 's gas reserves was at the heart of protests which saw two presidents thrown out of office .

the decision by bolivian leader evo morales , announced on monday , has alarmed argentina and brazil , who both have a major stake in bolivian gas .
but mr chavez - an ally of mr morales - said he congratulated his decision and hoped to " learn from bolivia 's wisdom " .
leaders from the four countries are to meet in argentina later on thursday .
the meeting was reportedly arranged after a conversation between brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva and his argentine counterpart , nestor kirchner , on tuesday .
brazil is the biggest investor in bolivian gas and also its biggest consumer , followed by argentina .
meanwhile , a one-day strike planned to protest at mr morales ' decision in the eastern city of santa cruz has been called off .
' risky move ' mr morales said on monday that private energy companies must review contracts and sell their controlling stakes in his country 's gas fields to his government .
with good will , morales will reach the agreements he needs to make with the foreign companies hugo chavez venezuelan president bolivia alarms powerful allies send us your comments the move follows from his election campaign pledge to give poorer bolivians , most of them indigenous people from the andean highlands , a bigger share in the country 's energy wealth .
the approach is backed mr chavez , seen as a mentor to mr morales , who negotiated similarly tough deals with global oil giants .
however , bbc brazil correspondent steve kingstone says the bolivian leader is nonetheless taking a risk .
multi-national gas companies have invested more than £ 3bn in bolivia and if they do not trust the government , they may take their business elsewhere .
' deep concern ' brazil 's state-owned energy company , petrobras , is the biggest investor in bolivia 's gas fields .
the brazilian government said on tuesday it respected bolivian sovereignty but added that it would negotiate firmly and calmly to preserve the interests of petrobras .

at the moment , television sets all receive an analogue signal , but this only provides the five main channels .
of course many people already watch digital pictures through a satellite , digital cable , or freeview which uses a normal tv aerial plugged into a box , which is in turn connected to a television .
but they can also watch programmes via the analogue signal .
eventually , everyone in the uk will need some means of watching programmes from a digital service as the analogue service is being phased out .
when is this happening ?
the first region to change is the border region - in 2008 .
the regions relate to the television regions that serve each part of the uk .
it will take until 2012 for every part of the uk to be switched over .
how can i watch digital tv ?
many people are already using digital equipment , either by satellite , cable , by phone service provider or digital terrestrial , or freeview in the uk .
as each region converts fully to digital , it will be necessary to use one of these ' platforms ' or methods to view television programmes .
in some areas of the media , the change has been referred to as ' switching off the analogue transmitter ' .
this is not strictly true - after the change , you will still be able to watch programmes via your aerial and a freeview box , even though the existing five channels wo n't be available on analogue , through your aerial .
many people have been concerned about the cost and inconvenience of having a new aerial - this wo n't be necessary .
if you want to have the extra premium satellite channels , from one of the commercial companies , then you will need either a digital satellite and receiver , or you may be able to get digital cable , if you live in an area where it is available .
will i be able to use my existing television set ?
yes , but many new televisions now come with a terrestrial digital -lrb- freeview -rrb- box already built into the set , which saves space and the hassle of connecting up wires and leads .
some digital terrestrial boxes are now also incredibly small , and simply plug directly into the back of your television .
what 's the main advantage of digital tv ?
better quality pictures , and a greater choice of channels .
if you live in an area where the existing freeview signal is poor , there is no need to worry as the signal will eventually be boosted , so again you wo n't have to switch to cable or satellite .
will i be able to watch and record videos ?
you will but it 's best to consult the digital uk website for information on how to do this .
eventually , there will be new vcrs capable of recording a digital programme while you watch another .
will i have to pay to subscribe to services ?
no , a freeview box , or a terrestrial receiver built into your television will provide you with several different channels without cost .
you will have to continue to pay for you television licence , irrespective of which digital platform you use .
how can i find out if a new television or other equipment will be suitable for digital ?

jasmine allen , 12 , from hafodyrynys , south wales died when the minibus she was travelling to school in crashed into a car and overturned in may 2005 .
a jury found christopher cushing , 38 , of bargoed , guilty of careless driving at cardiff crown court on wednesday .
it later emerged he had been unlicensed and uninsured to drive the minibus .
the hafodyrynys community is said to be " dumbfounded " at the verdict .
cushing was banned from driving for six months and fined £ 250 .
andrew lewis , chairman of hafodyrynys community association , said the supervision of bus contractors had to be tightened .
speaking after the trial , he told bbc wales : " i 'm dumbfound that taking a child 's life means a six months ' ban and £ 250 .
" how cheap is a child 's life ?
is it that cheap ?
campaign " it 's unbelievable that he should be driving a bus .
the local authority should be monitoring the situation much more closely than they are already .
" it 's no good just giving out a contract and putting the onus on the contractor .
" they should be making sure that the drivers of all the buses taking our kids to school should be properly monitored , should be properly identified . "
david cunningham-jones ' son stuart , 12 , died three-and-a-half years ago when his double-decker school bus crashed near his home in ystradowen , in the vale of glamorgan .
he and his wife have campaigned for tighter security on school transport ever since .
he said in a bbc interview : " we have managed to force a lot of organisations to look into school bus transport and do a review and come up with recommendations .
" we 're now looking for the national assembly to take action on the recommendations and put them into guidance for the local authorities to use .
" we need clarity first and foremost for everybody responsible for the school trips .
the problem with the trips at the moment is there are two many grey areas - we need it in black and white .
" the other thing is we ca n't cherry pick the recommendations .
we have to act on all the recommendations that have been made . "
john pockett from the confederation of passenger transport in wales has also called for " clarity " of responsibility .
" i think this is something that everybody involved in school transport has called for ever since and before the sad accident in cowbridge , " mr pockett said .
" the review the assembly set up showed there 's a plethora - an absolute complexity - of different legislation .
" where the responsibilities lie is not clear and david cunningham-jones ' call for clarity is something that the industry , groups and local authorities have been calling for a long time . "

jasmine allen , 12 , from hafodyrynys , south wales died when the minibus she was travelling to school in crashed into a car and overturned in may 2005 .
a jury found christopher cushing , 38 , of bargoed , guilty of careless driving at cardiff crown court on wednesday .
it later emerged he had been unlicensed and uninsured to drive the minibus .
the hafodyrynys community is said to be " dumbfounded " at the verdict .
cushing was banned from driving for six months and fined £ 250 .
andrew lewis , chairman of hafodyrynys community association , said the supervision of bus contractors had to be tightened .
speaking after the trial , he told bbc wales : " i 'm dumbfound that taking a child 's life means a six months ' ban and £ 250 .
" how cheap is a child 's life ?
is it that cheap ?
campaign " it 's unbelievable that he should be driving a bus .
the local authority should be monitoring the situation much more closely than they are already .
" it 's no good just giving out a contract and putting the onus on the contractor .
cushing was not insured to drive the minibus " they should be making sure that the drivers of all the buses taking our kids to school should be properly monitored , should be properly identified . "
david cunningham-jones ' son stuart , 12 , died three-and-a-half years ago when his double-decker school bus crashed near his home in ystradowen , in the vale of glamorgan .
he and his wife have campaigned for tighter security on school transport ever since .
he said in a bbc interview : " we have managed to force a lot of organisations to look into school bus transport and do a review and come up with recommendations .
" we 're now looking for the national assembly to take action on the recommendations and put them into guidance for the local authorities to use .
" we need clarity first and foremost for everybody responsible for the school trips .
the problem with the trips at the moment is there are two many grey areas - we need it in black and white .
" the other thing is we ca n't cherry pick the recommendations .
we have to act on all the recommendations that have been made . "
john pockett from the confederation of passenger transport in wales has also called for " clarity " of responsibility .
" i think this is something that everybody involved in school transport has called for ever since and before the sad accident in cowbridge , " mr pockett said .
" the review the assembly set up showed there 's a plethora - an absolute complexity - of different legislation .
" where the responsibilities lie is not clear and david cunningham-jones ' call for clarity is something that the industry , groups and local authorities have been calling for a long time . "

the original choice , snyder rini , resigned last week after his election sparked riots in the capital , honiara .
mr sogavare , who also served as prime minister between 2000 and 2001 , pledged to end corruption .
hundreds of foreign troops and police are in the solomons , having been deployed when the anti-rini protesters began damaging property and businesses .
mr sogavare defeated his main opponent fred fono by 28 votes to 22 in a secret parliamentary ballot , spokesman johnson honimae said on thursday .
his election was greeted by cheers from the hundreds of people who had gathered outside the parliament building to await the result .
" the parliament has made a decision for change , " mr sogavare told the crowd .
" this is an important change that people in the solomons have been looking forward to . "
he pledged his government would " address the underlying issues that caused the crisis in our country " .
but australian foreign minister alexander downer warned last week that regardless of who was elected as the nation 's new leader , the solomons would struggle to bring an end to corruption and political instability .
rates of poverty and unemployment in the solomons also remain stubbornly high , says a bbc correspondent , phil mercer .
short premiership mr sogavare 's election comes only three weeks after sydner rini was elected to the post .
but almost as soon as mr rini was announced as the premier on 18 april , protesters began claiming that either china or taiwan had paid lawmakers to vote for him .
riots broke out in honiara , and many chinese businesses were looted during the violence .
parts of the city were left in ruins .
mr rini resigned eight days after his election , when several members of his government - including mr sogavare - defected to the opposition .
his decision to step aside came just before mps were due to vote in a no-confidence motion against him .
two politicians opposed to mr rini 's election have been charged in relation to the riots and remanded in custody .
but both were allowed to vote from their cells in the latest leadership ballot .

residents in the donegall road area have been trapping the pests , but want the council , department of environment and contractors in the area to do more .
belfast city council has had its largest number of complaints about rats in more than three decades .
but the council said increased litter rather than construction was to blame .
raymond pullin from roden street told of a rat running over him as he put out his bin .
" i tilted the bin towards me to bring it out the gate and down the entry and , as i tilted it , the rat ran across my chest and over my shoulder and bounced onto the road , " he said .
" that 's when i knew there was rats in the garden . "
one woman said she was afraid of the vermin nesting under her grandchildren 's playhouse .
ulster unionist councillor bob stoker said residents wanted the rats cleared out of the area before the rest of the work on the westlink begins .
" we 're talking about putting contraceptives in the sewers to stop them breeding , those who miss being culled , and -lrb- doe -rrb- roads service and the contractor are not taking these suggestions seriously , " he said .
however , contractor michael deeney , from hmc construction , said that they had done everything possible .
" before we came into the area we got rentokill to come in on the site to do a cull basically of the existing rat holes , " he said .
" they put in a little gas pellet , sealed up the hole and killed off whatever rats were here .
" then we put a perimeter of rat boxes around the fenced off area - there are about 40 around this compound . "
however , the problem is not just confined to the area of the westlink .
last year , belfast city council received almost 6,000 pest complaints with 1,500 related to rats .
earl d 'hulst from the council 's pest control section said they had received more complaints this year than in the past 31 years .
" we do n't attribute that to any building work or construction work being carried out in the city , " he said .
" we attribute that to more people littering and not disposing of their rubbish properly . "
he said the best way to keep rats out was to keep litter in bins - not on the street .

work on the westlink has been blamed for the rat upsurge " we 're talking about putting contraceptives in the sewers to stop them breeding , those who miss being culled , and -lrb- doe -rrb- roads service and the contractor are not taking these suggestions seriously , " he said .
however , contractor michael deeney , from hmc construction , said that they had done everything possible .
" before we came into the area we got rentokill to come in on the site to do a cull basically of the existing rat holes , " he said .
" they put in a little gas pellet , sealed up the hole and killed off whatever rats were here .
" then we put a perimeter of rat boxes around the fenced off area - there are about 40 around this compound . "
however , the problem is not just confined to the area of the westlink .
last year , belfast city council received almost 6,000 pest complaints with 1,500 related to rats .
earl d 'hulst from the council 's pest control section said they had received more complaints this year than in the past 31 years .
" we do n't attribute that to any building work or construction work being carried out in the city , " he said .
" we attribute that to more people littering and not disposing of their rubbish properly . "
he said the best way to keep rats out was to keep litter in bins - not on the street .

announcing its results for its fourth quarter , the three months to 31 march , the world 's largest maker of computer games made a net loss of $ 16m -lrb- £ 9m -rrb- .
this compares with a net profit of $ 8m for the same period last year .
analysts said gamers were saving their money for the launch of new consoles by sony and nintendo later this year .
they also said that shortages of microsoft 's xbox 360 , which was released in november , had also hit electronic art 's -lrb- ea -rrb- sales .
ea 's fourth-quarter revenues rose to $ 641m from $ 553m a year earlier , helped by price cuts of 20 % on new titles such as " the godfather the game " and " black " .

viewers with satellite dishes can tune into a host of channels run by expatriate iranians , with 20 of them based in california alone , mostly in the los angeles area .
although possession of a satellite dish is technically illegal in iran , the ban is only sporadically enforced .
some of these exile stations are explicitly opposed to the government in tehran , but most simply offer western-style entertainment and talk shows that are not available on state-run tv .
they also offer a distinct take on the news , as state tv will not broadcast anything critical of the ruling establishment .
war of the blogs a profusion of news websites and blogs is matched only by the government 's efforts to control cyberspace .
after english , farsi is now one of the most widely-used languages in the " blogosphere " .
there are said to be over 100,000 active weblogs by iranians .
even politicians , including one former vice-president , have got in on the act .
the government has responded by taking action against individual bloggers , as well as trying to filter and block access to websites it objects to .
officials have spoken of plans to set up a " national " internet , effectively an intranet , enabling them to have more effective control of access to the wider , global internet .
there has also been an explosion in the number of news websites , many of them associated with the conservative end of the political spectrum .
tight control within iran , the broadcast media are firmly under state control .
no private channels are allowed .
the state broadcaster runs eight tv channels and eight radio networks , plus a number of provincial and international channels . "
even the occasional mildly satirical programme attracts the ire of the conservatives " its director-general is personally appointed by the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
some foreign films and documentaries are shown , but most tv programmes are domestically produced , covering a wide range of genres , but with a noticeable absence of musical entertainment and videos .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad has made known his opposition to the use of " banal and western " music and the need to promote islamic values .
the quality of the presentation has improved in recent years , with state-of-the-art graphics and slick studio sets .
but all female presenters still wear the traditional chador , or head-covering , and there are regular breaks to broadcast daily prayers .
even the occasional mildly satirical programme attracts the ire of the conservatives .
this recently prompted a defeated presidential candidate to try and set up a tv channel broadcasting out of dubai .
but the plan fell through after strenuous pressure from tehran .
journalists under fire the newspaper industry burgeoned in the 1990s , especially under the first presidency of mohammad khatami -lrb- 1997-2001 -rrb- , and there was a short period of relative press freedom .
but the judicial authorities stepped in and forced the closure of over 100 publications , many of which took a more liberal or reformist line .
more recently , the authorities have tended to take action against individual journalists rather than publications .
in november 2005 , reporters without borders called for an end to the harassment and intimidation of journalists .
the press freedom watchdog said that at least 10 journalists had been interrogated and advised not to write articles critical of the government .
in particular , they were warned against writing about sensitive issues such as iran 's nuclear programme .
newspapers also face difficulties because of falling readership and a decline in advertising revenue .
although editions of popular sports dailies may sell over a million copies , political dailies have a circulation of a few hundred thousand at most .
the difficulties facing the iranian media are illustrated by the recent case of a young female journalist on a provincial newspaper .
searching the internet for material for an article for the health pages , she copied and pasted something about aids from the weblog of an expatriate iranian .
unfortunately , this was a satirical piece which made unflattering comparisons between aids and the deceased leader of the revolution , ayatollah khomeini .

they also offer a distinct take on the news , as state tv will not broadcast anything critical of the ruling establishment .
war of the blogs there are now more than 100,000 active blogs in iran a profusion of news websites and blogs is matched only by the government 's efforts to control cyberspace .
after english , farsi is now one of the most widely-used languages in the " blogosphere " .
there are said to be over 100,000 active weblogs by iranians .
even politicians , including one former vice-president , have got in on the act .
the government has responded by taking action against individual bloggers , as well as trying to filter and block access to websites it objects to .
officials have spoken of plans to set up a " national " internet , effectively an intranet , enabling them to have more effective control of access to the wider , global internet .
there has also been an explosion in the number of news websites , many of them associated with the conservative end of the political spectrum .
tight control within iran , the broadcast media are firmly under state control .
no private channels are allowed .
the state broadcaster runs eight tv channels and eight radio networks , plus a number of provincial and international channels .
even the occasional mildly satirical programme attracts the ire of the conservatives its director-general is personally appointed by the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
some foreign films and documentaries are shown , but most tv programmes are domestically produced , covering a wide range of genres , but with a noticeable absence of musical entertainment and videos .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad has made known his opposition to the use of " banal and western " music and the need to promote islamic values .
the quality of the presentation has improved in recent years , with state-of-the-art graphics and slick studio sets .
but all female presenters still wear the traditional chador , or head-covering , and there are regular breaks to broadcast daily prayers .
even the occasional mildly satirical programme attracts the ire of the conservatives .
this recently prompted a defeated presidential candidate to try and set up a tv channel broadcasting out of dubai .
but the plan fell through after strenuous pressure from tehran .
journalists under fire sports newspapers far outsell political dailies the newspaper industry burgeoned in the 1990s , especially under the first presidency of mohammad khatami -lrb- 1997-2001 -rrb- , and there was a short period of relative press freedom .
but the judicial authorities stepped in and forced the closure of over 100 publications , many of which took a more liberal or reformist line .
more recently , the authorities have tended to take action against individual journalists rather than publications .
in november 2005 , reporters without borders called for an end to the harassment and intimidation of journalists .
the press freedom watchdog said that at least 10 journalists had been interrogated and advised not to write articles critical of the government .
in particular , they were warned against writing about sensitive issues such as iran 's nuclear programme .
newspapers also face difficulties because of falling readership and a decline in advertising revenue .
although editions of popular sports dailies may sell over a million copies , political dailies have a circulation of a few hundred thousand at most .
the difficulties facing the iranian media are illustrated by the recent case of a young female journalist on a provincial newspaper .
searching the internet for material for an article for the health pages , she copied and pasted something about aids from the weblog of an expatriate iranian .
unfortunately , this was a satirical piece which made unflattering comparisons between aids and the deceased leader of the revolution , ayatollah khomeini .
the paper has since been closed , its director jailed , and the young journalist is still in prison awaiting trial .
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .

in an article for the bbc scotland news website , deputy justice minister hugh henry explains how the legislation will work for parents and children . "
family law in scotland is changing to keep up with the way we live our lives today .
in december 2005 , the scottish parliament passed the family law -lrb- scotland -rrb- act and that act has become law .
changes cover a range of issues , such as parental responsibilities and rights , marriage , divorce , domestic abuse and introducing legal safeguards for cohabiting couples and their children .
i want to be clear that these changes will not make divorce easy or undermine marriage .
but they will reduce the separation periods which must be served before a divorce can be granted . "
one of the most important reforms serves to strengthen the bond between fathers and their children " divorce is never easy and when a marriage breaks down it serves no-one 's interests to postpone the point at which they can all move on with their lives .
our guiding principle has been the best interests of scotland 's children .
one of the most important reforms serves to strengthen the bond between fathers and their children .
from thursday a father whose name appears on his child 's birth certificate will automatically have parental responsibilities and rights - whether he is married to the child 's mother or not .
this is not about giving adults rights over children , but rather recognising that marital status is a decision made by parents not by children .
for cohabiting couples distribution of property following relationship breakdown , or the death of a partner , was previously left to the common law - with all its inherent variability .
but the absence of systematic regulation sat uncomfortably alongside the increasing number of cohabiting couples - leaving a significant number of scotland 's children living in cohabiting-couple families vulnerable .
the act therefore introduces a set of limited rights for cohabiting couples when their relationship ends .
but making changes to the law is not enough .
we have also worked with support services to develop a range of non-legislative measures to complement our law reforms . "
our work does not stop here " for example , we have launched an information campaign to advise people of the changes that are coming into force .
information booklets are being distributed widely through citizens advice bureaux , libraries and local support organisations and are available to view at www.scotland.gov.uk / familylaw .
we are also providing additional funding to the national family support services to promote joined up working at both local and national level .
but perhaps most significantly , we have introduced parenting agreements for scotland and a charter for grandchildren .
the parenting agreement pack is designed to help separating parents put aside their differences and focus on their children 's needs when deciding the arrangements for their future care .
the pack guides parents through some of the difficult decisions that will need to be made and highlights some of the issues that they might want to think about .
in addition the charter for grandchildren highlights the important role grandparents and the wider family can play in a child 's life and how during difficult times , they may be a source of support and stability .
but our work does not stop here .
next we will be commissioning research into post-separation contact arrangements to examine the effectiveness of contact orders .
once we have a clear picture of the scottish position we can start to design improvements .
we are also working with the courts to develop a project to pilot the appointment of family contact facilitators who will contribute to the resolution of disputed contact cases and contribute to developing ideas for reducing the incidence of breaches .
taken together i am confident that these measures will offer scotland 's families , and in particular scotland 's children , the framework needed to support strong and stable family units . "

we have also worked with support services to develop a range of non-legislative measures to complement our law reforms .
our work does not stop here for example , we have launched an information campaign to advise people of the changes that are coming into force .

the parenting agreement pack is designed to help separating parents put aside their differences and focus on their children 's needs when deciding the arrangements for their future care .
restictions covering separation and divorce have been eased the pack guides parents through some of the difficult decisions that will need to be made and highlights some of the issues that they might want to think about .
in addition the charter for grandchildren highlights the important role grandparents and the wider family can play in a child 's life and how during difficult times , they may be a source of support and stability .

next we will be commissioning research into post-separation contact arrangements to examine the effectiveness of contact orders .

we are also working with the courts to develop a project to pilot the appointment of family contact facilitators who will contribute to the resolution of disputed contact cases and contribute to developing ideas for reducing the incidence of breaches .
taken together i am confident that these measures will offer scotland 's families , and in particular scotland 's children , the framework needed to support strong and stable family units .
