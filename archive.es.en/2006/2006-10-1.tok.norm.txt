' this choice was disasterous ' ironically , while haider has moved towards the center during his party 's time in government , strache has risen in his party using the populist and openly xenophobic stance that haider had used when in the opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are expected to vote conservative this time " neither the oevp nor the fpoe wish to govern together , " political scientist peter ulram from the university of vienna said . ulram said the fpoe fears that if it entered government , it would alienate its supporters who are not willing to abandon their far-right hardline . despite some political victories , including stricter immigration laws , haider 's star has been fading because of a " re-centering inherent to governing , " suffering electoral losses everywhere since 2002 except in his southern province of carinthia , ulram said . overtaken by the 36-year-old strache , haider , 56 , left the fpoe to found the bzoe , a " modern and responsible " far-right , in the spring of 2005 . in may of this year however , he handed over the party reins to his former personal secretary peter westenthaler , 38 , who is the bzoe 's top candidate in sunday 's elections . " this choice was disastrous and definitely hurt the bzoe 's image , as westenthaler organised a campaign resembling strache 's , " ulram said . wanting a ' direct ' mandate comments by westenthaler demanding the expulsion from austria of 300,000 foreigners led justice minister karin gastinger , a moderate in the bzoe , to quit the party this week .
the fpoe and bzoe now accuse each other of treason and plagiarism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schüssel is expected to win sunday the fpoe has , however , managed to have itself placed third on voting cards , after austria 's two major parties , schüssel 's people 's party and the socialists -lrb- spoe -rrb- . haider is desperately fighting in carinthia , where he is governor , to have his party receive a " direct mandate " to get into parliament . haider still needs six points to achieve the 27 percent of votes necessary in his constituency to obtain a direct mandate , according to polls . in a return to hardline politicking , haider " is staking everything -lrb- in his campaign -rrb- on a refusal to give language rights to the slovenian minority in the name of national-german feelings , " klaus ottomeyer , a professor at the university of klagenfurt in carinthia , said . in 2000 , the fpoe 's entry into government had caused the european union to impose diplomatic sanctions on austria . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right wants to expand west encouraged by their successes at polls in the economically sagging eastern germany , far-right political parties are now trying to appeal to disgruntled voters in the western part of the country .

they also addressed stockpiling of tamiflu , one of the only known drugs that can cure bird flu symptoms . avian influenza , or the h5n1 virus , began in southeast asia in mid-2003 , with the disease initially transmitted between birds .
however , the virus " crossed the species barrier " to humans .
of 244 people infected with the virus , 143 have died , according to the world health organization . vaccination priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurth hopes a pandemic could be avoided if birds are vaccinated fatalities are inevitable , and that the key to limiting the number of deaths is planning for an outbreak and having enough vaccinations for the whole population , said reinhard kurth , the president of germany 's robert koch institute .
kurth added that priority for vaccinations should be given to health workers and infants " who are more susceptible to death . ' " four million dosages can be produced in a week , so it would take 20 weeks to inoculate the entire german population , " he said .
" the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has said it is willing to invest a lot on money in vaccinations on a mass scale . " of the $ 1.9 billion -lrb- 1.49 billion euros -rrb- the international community has pledged to management of avian influenza , the eu has contributed 211 million euros .
the european commission has collaborated with member states and the world health organization to develop eu preparedness planning .
kurth said he is hopeful that one of the solutions to minimizing the outbreak will be getting farmers to vaccinate all of their birds . boosting tamilflu orders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tamiflu is regarded as the most effective drug to couteract the h5n1 virus hoffmann-la roche , the sole supplier of tamiflu has quadrupled its production capacity over the past two years .
however , current supply is thought to cover just two percent of the world population . jane lahl and isabel burckhardt from hoffmann-la roche pharmaceuticals said orders for the drug need to increase because currently there is not enough for the eu population .
lahl said drugs are the only option to containing a full-blown pandemic , but notably she is a spokeswoman for a pharmaceutical company . lahl and burckhardt both stressed that working out the logistics of distributing the drug " in an uncomplicated way " was imperative .
burckhardt also encouraged a continuation of production levels . " we can not simply open the valve when the demand increases , " she said . world-wide warning systems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication is key - experts at a conference in early 2006 massimo ciotti of the eu center for disease and prevention control response unit said eu countries should not be spending all the money on just one drug , like tamiflu , but there should be a range of measures implemented .
he promoted warning and information systems worldwide and global communication , to prevent a pandemic if there is an outbreak . ciotti also urged that it was imperative the eu establish a unified position and added that eu preparations are on track .
but there are many aspects that need to be solved , such as who would be prioritized for vaccinations if there was not enough for everyone , he said . " would it be the policeman or the child ? " he asked .
" there are issues of closing borders if tamiflu is distributed in some countries and not others .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the pope in bavaria the pope as pop star in bavaria pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image pope benedict xvi : " we have a positive idea to offer " gay rights activists stage protest ahead of pope visit opinion -pipe- 01.10.2006 opinion : a calculated risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims may have been angered by pope benedict xvi 's recent speech in regensburg .
but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .
in november the pope will meet patriarch bartholomew i , and no doubt he will receive a warm welcome . john berwick is dw-tv 's religious affairs correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls inter-faith dialogue crucial to peace during a meeting with muslims envoys on monday , pope benedict xvi said a dialogue between christians and muslims is " vital " to peace and stability in a world threatened by religious tensions .

" we owe it to these men who paid a price in blood , and to their children and their grandchildren , many of whom are french , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is said to have instigated paris to unfreeze pensions for non-french veterans " days of glory , " by french-algerian director rachid bouchareb , is largely credited with the decision . movie draws controversy the movie concentrates on some of the 300,000 soldiers from france 's former african colonies who made up more than half the 550,000 troops in its army fighting the germans . it is unflinching in detailing the humiliations and bias suffered by those colonial forces who were pressed to fight for the " motherland " but who were treated as second-class beings by their white superiors . the interest in the film brought attention to the pension freeze imposed by paris in 1959 , which resulted in moroccan veterans , for instance , often receiving little more than one-tenth of what a former french soldier gets . a 2001 court ruling pushing the government to revise the freeze had resulted in only slight pension increases , in which the cost of living in the veteran 's home country was used as a benchmark , not the pension paid in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie details hardships suffered by foreign soldiers fighting for france many in the country 's sizeable arab immigrant community were expected to flock to the new film , as were others curious to see a chapter often neglected in french history books . screening of the film came amid heightened tensions in high-immigrant suburbs around paris which had been involved in the riots which shook the country last november . on monday , 220 police raided a housing project in the southern suburb of corbeil-essonnes to arrest 11 people they suspected of participating in an ambush of two officers that left both badly beaten . nicolas sarkozy , france 's ambitious interior minister who hopes to succeed chirac in elections next year , has been aggressively promoting tough law-and-order policies and immigration controls . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bestselling novel " perfume " hits the big screen reviews of the long-awaited film version of " perfume , " the bestselling novel by patrick süskind , are ambivalent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the pope in bavaria the pope as pop star in bavaria pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image pope benedict xvi : " we have a positive idea to offer " gay rights activists stage protest ahead of pope visit opinion -pipe- 01.10.2006 opinion : a calculated risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims may have been angered by pope benedict xvi 's recent speech in regensburg .
but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 01.10.2006 german firms desperate for specialists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies have trouble finding the specialists they need german firms are hard-pressed to find qualified personnel for specialized positions .
at the same time , over 4.2 million people were registered as jobless in september .
this disconnect is a huge problem for both sides . " one definitely notices that it 's harder to get specialists and good experts , " said matthias pauers .
" we find average employees without a problem .
but positions for employees with outstanding , special know-how are very hard to fill at the moment . " pauers is the head of product development at matrix 42 , a german software manufacturer .
since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .
and he 's not alone .
there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .
teachers of science and medicine are also in extremely short supply . " one reason is that society and , in part , companies did n't expect the vehemence of demand for german capital goods on the world market , " said volker treier , an economist at the german association of chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" and that has to do with , above all , that one did n't know how china and india and other emerging nations would become part of the world economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has for some time had a dearth of it specialists mid-sized companies , such as matrix 42 , have an especially difficult time finding specialists , who are mostly snapped up by big firms .
and , despite the fact that millions of people are out of work in germany , most of them are unqualified for high-level jobs .
from bad to worse the situation is likely to get even worse over the next 10 years , said peter schnur of the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- .
" the most negative vision is that we will have a relatively high lack of specialists concurrent with high unemployment among people whose qualifications are low . " it 's problematic that germany 's birth rate is also very low .
the iab estimates that the 700,000 children born this year will enter the labor market when today 's 1.5 million 40-year-old germans reach retirement - less than half as many people will be available to take the vacant places in the working world . " in the mid- and long terms , we face something like a reversal of the trend , " said schnur .
" and it will be such that in the long-term future , that is , around the end of the next decade , it 's highly probable there will be a significantly lower labor force .
not with a decline in jobs but rather with fewer people who want work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unemployed do n't necessarily have the skills employers are looking for but having a job supply larger than the labor force wo n't necessarily mean lower unemployment .
if young people are n't trained to meet the requirements of highly specialized jobs , relatively high unemployment will remain a problem despite demographic developments .
the search for solutions matthias pauers and his colleagues believe they can make a difference by providing incentives for potential new employees . " in addition to paying adequately , one should invest in training employees , " pauers said .
" and one should give new employees the perspective that they , even if they are specialists , can still get further training . " companies have recognized that education is essential to ensure they can find the employees they need .
more should be done in that area , according to the dihk 's treier .
school kids should study more math and science to develop the curiosity - and the prerequisites - to pursue studies or other training in those areas . for the time being though , companies must find a way to satisfy their labor needs .
the riedlbauer group , a german firm focused on outsourcing support services and telemarketing , which has difficulties finding specialists in information technologies and stochastic , a field of mathematics , decided to tackle the problem by offering a training program .
opportunities for older people but recruiting employees abroad is another possibility .
ceo erich riedlbauer has hired specialists from russia and has put out feelers for it experts in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older people may yet find it easier to re-enter the working world he is , however , party of a minority among german businesspeople .
only 6 percent of german companies would consider searching for specialist staff abroad , according to a dihk poll .
most employers first want to exhaust the possibilities at home , and 15 percent said they will focus on older specialists when personnel shortages get worse .
more than half of those surveyed said that training was the way to deal with the lack of specialists in the future . that may just translate into new opportunities for older , unemployed people , who have a particularly hard time re-entering the professional world in germany . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no brakes on germany 's population freefall a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .
in november the pope will meet patriarch bartholomew i , and no doubt he will receive a warm welcome . john berwick is dw-tv 's religious affairs correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls inter-faith dialogue crucial to peace during a meeting with muslims envoys on monday , pope benedict xvi said a dialogue between christians and muslims is " vital " to peace and stability in a world threatened by religious tensions .

at the same time , over 4.2 million people were registered as jobless in september .
this disconnect is a huge problem for both sides . " one definitely notices that it 's harder to get specialists and good experts , " said matthias pauers .
" we find average employees without a problem .
but positions for employees with outstanding , special know-how are very hard to fill at the moment . " pauers is the head of product development at matrix 42 , a german software manufacturer .
since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .
and he 's not alone .
there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .
teachers of science and medicine are also in extremely short supply . " one reason is that society and , in part , companies did n't expect the vehemence of demand for german capital goods on the world market , " said volker treier , an economist at the german association of chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 01.10.2006 german firms desperate for specialists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies have trouble finding the specialists they need german firms are hard-pressed to find qualified personnel for specialized positions .
at the same time , over 4.2 million people were registered as jobless in september .
this disconnect is a huge problem for both sides . " one definitely notices that it 's harder to get specialists and good experts , " said matthias pauers .
" we find average employees without a problem .
but positions for employees with outstanding , special know-how are very hard to fill at the moment . " pauers is the head of product development at matrix 42 , a german software manufacturer .
since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .
and he 's not alone .
there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .
teachers of science and medicine are also in extremely short supply . " one reason is that society and , in part , companies did n't expect the vehemence of demand for german capital goods on the world market , " said volker treier , an economist at the german association of chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" and that has to do with , above all , that one did n't know how china and india and other emerging nations would become part of the world economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has for some time had a dearth of it specialists mid-sized companies , such as matrix 42 , have an especially difficult time finding specialists , who are mostly snapped up by big firms .
and , despite the fact that millions of people are out of work in germany , most of them are unqualified for high-level jobs .
from bad to worse the situation is likely to get even worse over the next 10 years , said peter schnur of the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- .
" the most negative vision is that we will have a relatively high lack of specialists concurrent with high unemployment among people whose qualifications are low . " it 's problematic that germany 's birth rate is also very low .
the iab estimates that the 700,000 children born this year will enter the labor market when today 's 1.5 million 40-year-old germans reach retirement - less than half as many people will be available to take the vacant places in the working world . " in the mid- and long terms , we face something like a reversal of the trend , " said schnur .
" and it will be such that in the long-term future , that is , around the end of the next decade , it 's highly probable there will be a significantly lower labor force .
not with a decline in jobs but rather with fewer people who want work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unemployed do n't necessarily have the skills employers are looking for but having a job supply larger than the labor force wo n't necessarily mean lower unemployment .
if young people are n't trained to meet the requirements of highly specialized jobs , relatively high unemployment will remain a problem despite demographic developments .
the search for solutions matthias pauers and his colleagues believe they can make a difference by providing incentives for potential new employees . " in addition to paying adequately , one should invest in training employees , " pauers said .
" and one should give new employees the perspective that they , even if they are specialists , can still get further training . " companies have recognized that education is essential to ensure they can find the employees they need .
more should be done in that area , according to the dihk 's treier .
school kids should study more math and science to develop the curiosity - and the prerequisites - to pursue studies or other training in those areas . for the time being though , companies must find a way to satisfy their labor needs .
the riedlbauer group , a german firm focused on outsourcing support services and telemarketing , which has difficulties finding specialists in information technologies and stochastic , a field of mathematics , decided to tackle the problem by offering a training program .
opportunities for older people but recruiting employees abroad is another possibility .
ceo erich riedlbauer has hired specialists from russia and has put out feelers for it experts in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older people may yet find it easier to re-enter the working world he is , however , party of a minority among german businesspeople .
only 6 percent of german companies would consider searching for specialist staff abroad , according to a dihk poll .
most employers first want to exhaust the possibilities at home , and 15 percent said they will focus on older specialists when personnel shortages get worse .
more than half of those surveyed said that training was the way to deal with the lack of specialists in the future . that may just translate into new opportunities for older , unemployed people , who have a particularly hard time re-entering the professional world in germany . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no brakes on germany 's population freefall a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .

" under the leadership of klaus kleinfeld , the giant is lurching , " the munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung said on friday of the 48-year-old who took over the reins at siemens last year .
kleinfeld " has not had the magic touch so far , " the paper added . over the past fortnight , unions , politicians and even a bishop have hardly had a good word to say about one of germany 's industrial jewels , which last year had revenues of 75 billion euros -lrb- 95 billion dollars -rrb- with two billion euros net income . even the conservative leader of the powerful state of bavaria , edmund stoiber , stepped into the row , describing the pay hikes at the munich-based firm as " extremely regrettable " . soccer analogy backfires on chairman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would bayern be happy being the siemens of soccer ?
heinrich von pierer , siemens ' supervisory board chairman , tried to justify the move with a reference to germany 's top football team .
" at siemens , we are playing in the champions league , not in the bavarian local league .
and like bayern munich , we will only attract the top staff if we pay the right sort of money , " he said last week . it was not an argument that went down well with workers . in the telecommunications division com , 1,000 people are about to lose their jobs , hot on the heels of the 1,500 cut last year .
another 5,400 jobs are set to be slashed in the sbs information technology subsidiary , including 2,400 in germany . rumours are flying that either one or both units might be shut down . employees flood intranet with concerns " when you tell someone where you work , the first question is ' when are you going to be fired ' , " said one disgruntled employee in response to kleinfeld 's blog , which employees can access on the company 's internal intranet . another entry said : " a lot of bosses have passed through siemens ' doors .
is one of them now going to destroy everything and , what 's more , get rewarded for it ? " against this tense backdrop , benq 's decision to shut down its mobile phone manufacturing in germany inflicted further harm to siemens ' image . siemens offloaded the mobile phone operations to the taiwanese firm last year , even paying to have it taken off its hands , observers recalled on friday . unions urge wronged workers to rise up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall leader urges action at siemens unions have told benq mobile 's employees in munich and sites in western germany to vent their anger at siemens .
" they have been wronged twice , " said the head of the ig metall union , jürgen peters . the general opinion seems to be that siemens raised unrealistic expectations that the loss-making unit could be saved and then left someone else to do the dirty work . " from an economic point of view , kleinfeld has perhaps acted in the correct manner , but his reputation as someone who can turn around companies in a tough but always fair way has been lost , " said an editorial in friday 's financial times deutschland . even kleinfeld 's attempts at introducing an american-style motivational slogan in an email to staff have been mocked - " work hard , win big , have fun " has been twisted into " live hard , never rest , die young " , according to der spiegel magazine . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benq 's german workers blame former owners siemens the decision by taiwan 's benq to shut off further investment in its german subsidiary benq-siemens and seek insolvency protection has left the company 's 3,000 employees feeling betrayed .

they also addressed stockpiling of tamiflu , one of the only known drugs that can cure bird flu symptoms . avian influenza , or the h5n1 virus , began in southeast asia in mid-2003 , with the disease initially transmitted between birds .
however , the virus " crossed the species barrier " to humans .
of 244 people infected with the virus , 143 have died , according to the world health organization . vaccination priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurth hopes a pandemic could be avoided if birds are vaccinated fatalities are inevitable , and that the key to limiting the number of deaths is planning for an outbreak and having enough vaccinations for the whole population , said reinhard kurth , the president of germany 's robert koch institute .
kurth added that priority for vaccinations should be given to health workers and infants " who are more susceptible to death . ' " four million dosages can be produced in a week , so it would take 20 weeks to inoculate the entire german population , " he said .
" the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has said it is willing to invest a lot on money in vaccinations on a mass scale . " of the $ 1.9 billion -lrb- 1.49 billion euros -rrb- the international community has pledged to management of avian influenza , the eu has contributed 211 million euros .
the european commission has collaborated with member states and the world health organization to develop eu preparedness planning .
kurth said he is hopeful that one of the solutions to minimizing the outbreak will be getting farmers to vaccinate all of their birds . boosting tamilflu orders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tamiflu is regarded as the most effective drug to couteract the h5n1 virus hoffmann-la roche , the sole supplier of tamiflu has quadrupled its production capacity over the past two years .
however , current supply is thought to cover just two percent of the world population . jane lahl and isabel burckhardt from hoffmann-la roche pharmaceuticals said orders for the drug need to increase because currently there is not enough for the eu population .
lahl said drugs are the only option to containing a full-blown pandemic , but notably she is a spokeswoman for a pharmaceutical company . lahl and burckhardt both stressed that working out the logistics of distributing the drug " in an uncomplicated way " was imperative .
burckhardt also encouraged a continuation of production levels . " we can not simply open the valve when the demand increases , " she said . world-wide warning systems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication is key - experts at a conference in early 2006 massimo ciotti of the eu center for disease and prevention control response unit said eu countries should not be spending all the money on just one drug , like tamiflu , but there should be a range of measures implemented .
he promoted warning and information systems worldwide and global communication , to prevent a pandemic if there is an outbreak . ciotti also urged that it was imperative the eu establish a unified position and added that eu preparations are on track .
but there are many aspects that need to be solved , such as who would be prioritized for vaccinations if there was not enough for everyone , he said . " would it be the policeman or the child ? " he asked .
" there are issues of closing borders if tamiflu is distributed in some countries and not others .
but one thing is clear : we need to distribute vaccination quickly after an outbreak . " there are over 480 million people across the eu and there are substantial differences across different countries with demographics , geography and available services and health systems , " he said .
" now there is free movement across borders .
this means there will be free movement of diseases .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .

" we can not simply open the valve when the demand increases , " she said . world-wide warning systems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication is key - experts at a conference in early 2006 massimo ciotti of the eu center for disease and prevention control response unit said eu countries should not be spending all the money on just one drug , like tamiflu , but there should be a range of measures implemented .
he promoted warning and information systems worldwide and global communication , to prevent a pandemic if there is an outbreak . ciotti also urged that it was imperative the eu establish a unified position and added that eu preparations are on track .
but there are many aspects that need to be solved , such as who would be prioritized for vaccinations if there was not enough for everyone , he said . " would it be the policeman or the child ? " he asked .
" there are issues of closing borders if tamiflu is distributed in some countries and not others .
but one thing is clear : we need to distribute vaccination quickly after an outbreak . " there are over 480 million people across the eu and there are substantial differences across different countries with demographics , geography and available services and health systems , " he said .
" now there is free movement across borders .
this means there will be free movement of diseases .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .

this disconnect is a huge problem for both sides . " one definitely notices that it 's harder to get specialists and good experts , " said matthias pauers .
" we find average employees without a problem .
but positions for employees with outstanding , special know-how are very hard to fill at the moment . " pauers is the head of product development at matrix 42 , a german software manufacturer .
since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .
and he 's not alone .
there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .
teachers of science and medicine are also in extremely short supply . " one reason is that society and , in part , companies did n't expect the vehemence of demand for german capital goods on the world market , " said volker treier , an economist at the german association of chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .

and , despite the fact that millions of people are out of work in germany , most of them are unqualified for high-level jobs .
from bad to worse the situation is likely to get even worse over the next 10 years , said peter schnur of the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- .
" the most negative vision is that we will have a relatively high lack of specialists concurrent with high unemployment among people whose qualifications are low . " it 's problematic that germany 's birth rate is also very low .
the iab estimates that the 700,000 children born this year will enter the labor market when today 's 1.5 million 40-year-old germans reach retirement - less than half as many people will be available to take the vacant places in the working world . " in the mid- and long terms , we face something like a reversal of the trend , " said schnur .
" and it will be such that in the long-term future , that is , around the end of the next decade , it 's highly probable there will be a significantly lower labor force .
not with a decline in jobs but rather with fewer people who want work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unemployed do n't necessarily have the skills employers are looking for but having a job supply larger than the labor force wo n't necessarily mean lower unemployment .
if young people are n't trained to meet the requirements of highly specialized jobs , relatively high unemployment will remain a problem despite demographic developments .
the search for solutions matthias pauers and his colleagues believe they can make a difference by providing incentives for potential new employees . " in addition to paying adequately , one should invest in training employees , " pauers said .
" and one should give new employees the perspective that they , even if they are specialists , can still get further training . " companies have recognized that education is essential to ensure they can find the employees they need .
more should be done in that area , according to the dihk 's treier .
school kids should study more math and science to develop the curiosity - and the prerequisites - to pursue studies or other training in those areas . for the time being though , companies must find a way to satisfy their labor needs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 01.10.2006 new french film highlights roots of bias against north africans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie tells the story of foreign soldiers who fought for france in wwii a recently released french film has sparked renewed debate over discrimination against north africans - and may have prompted president jacques chirac to redress an egregious imbalance . the movie , called " indigenes " -lrb- " natives " -rrb- in france , has created a stir beyond the simple boundaries of its story about a band of moroccans and algerians fighting valiantly in the french army during world war ii . president jacques chirac , who early this month requested a private screening of the film , which will be released as " days of glory " in english , ordered his government to revise a four-decade freeze on pensions for non-french war veterans , most of them from north and west africa . the decision , which raises the pensions for former troops from france 's ex-colonies to the same level as their french counterparts at a cost of 110 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- a year , was " an act of justice , " chirac told his cabinet . " we owe it to these men who paid a price in blood , and to their children and their grandchildren , many of whom are french , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is said to have instigated paris to unfreeze pensions for non-french veterans " days of glory , " by french-algerian director rachid bouchareb , is largely credited with the decision . movie draws controversy the movie concentrates on some of the 300,000 soldiers from france 's former african colonies who made up more than half the 550,000 troops in its army fighting the germans . it is unflinching in detailing the humiliations and bias suffered by those colonial forces who were pressed to fight for the " motherland " but who were treated as second-class beings by their white superiors . the interest in the film brought attention to the pension freeze imposed by paris in 1959 , which resulted in moroccan veterans , for instance , often receiving little more than one-tenth of what a former french soldier gets . a 2001 court ruling pushing the government to revise the freeze had resulted in only slight pension increases , in which the cost of living in the veteran 's home country was used as a benchmark , not the pension paid in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie details hardships suffered by foreign soldiers fighting for france many in the country 's sizeable arab immigrant community were expected to flock to the new film , as were others curious to see a chapter often neglected in french history books . screening of the film came amid heightened tensions in high-immigrant suburbs around paris which had been involved in the riots which shook the country last november . on monday , 220 police raided a housing project in the southern suburb of corbeil-essonnes to arrest 11 people they suspected of participating in an ambush of two officers that left both badly beaten . nicolas sarkozy , france 's ambitious interior minister who hopes to succeed chirac in elections next year , has been aggressively promoting tough law-and-order policies and immigration controls . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bestselling novel " perfume " hits the big screen reviews of the long-awaited film version of " perfume , " the bestselling novel by patrick süskind , are ambivalent .

since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .
and he 's not alone .
there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .
teachers of science and medicine are also in extremely short supply . " one reason is that society and , in part , companies did n't expect the vehemence of demand for german capital goods on the world market , " said volker treier , an economist at the german association of chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" and that has to do with , above all , that one did n't know how china and india and other emerging nations would become part of the world economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has for some time had a dearth of it specialists mid-sized companies , such as matrix 42 , have an especially difficult time finding specialists , who are mostly snapped up by big firms .
and , despite the fact that millions of people are out of work in germany , most of them are unqualified for high-level jobs .
from bad to worse the situation is likely to get even worse over the next 10 years , said peter schnur of the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- .
" the most negative vision is that we will have a relatively high lack of specialists concurrent with high unemployment among people whose qualifications are low . " it 's problematic that germany 's birth rate is also very low .
the iab estimates that the 700,000 children born this year will enter the labor market when today 's 1.5 million 40-year-old germans reach retirement - less than half as many people will be available to take the vacant places in the working world . " in the mid- and long terms , we face something like a reversal of the trend , " said schnur .
" and it will be such that in the long-term future , that is , around the end of the next decade , it 's highly probable there will be a significantly lower labor force .
not with a decline in jobs but rather with fewer people who want work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unemployed do n't necessarily have the skills employers are looking for but having a job supply larger than the labor force wo n't necessarily mean lower unemployment .
if young people are n't trained to meet the requirements of highly specialized jobs , relatively high unemployment will remain a problem despite demographic developments .
the search for solutions matthias pauers and his colleagues believe they can make a difference by providing incentives for potential new employees . " in addition to paying adequately , one should invest in training employees , " pauers said .
" and one should give new employees the perspective that they , even if they are specialists , can still get further training . " companies have recognized that education is essential to ensure they can find the employees they need .
more should be done in that area , according to the dihk 's treier .
school kids should study more math and science to develop the curiosity - and the prerequisites - to pursue studies or other training in those areas . for the time being though , companies must find a way to satisfy their labor needs .
the riedlbauer group , a german firm focused on outsourcing support services and telemarketing , which has difficulties finding specialists in information technologies and stochastic , a field of mathematics , decided to tackle the problem by offering a training program .
opportunities for older people but recruiting employees abroad is another possibility .
ceo erich riedlbauer has hired specialists from russia and has put out feelers for it experts in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older people may yet find it easier to re-enter the working world he is , however , party of a minority among german businesspeople .
only 6 percent of german companies would consider searching for specialist staff abroad , according to a dihk poll .
most employers first want to exhaust the possibilities at home , and 15 percent said they will focus on older specialists when personnel shortages get worse .
more than half of those surveyed said that training was the way to deal with the lack of specialists in the future . that may just translate into new opportunities for older , unemployed people , who have a particularly hard time re-entering the professional world in germany . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no brakes on germany 's population freefall a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .

" we owe it to these men who paid a price in blood , and to their children and their grandchildren , many of whom are french , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is said to have instigated paris to unfreeze pensions for non-french veterans " days of glory , " by french-algerian director rachid bouchareb , is largely credited with the decision . movie draws controversy the movie concentrates on some of the 300,000 soldiers from france 's former african colonies who made up more than half the 550,000 troops in its army fighting the germans . it is unflinching in detailing the humiliations and bias suffered by those colonial forces who were pressed to fight for the " motherland " but who were treated as second-class beings by their white superiors . the interest in the film brought attention to the pension freeze imposed by paris in 1959 , which resulted in moroccan veterans , for instance , often receiving little more than one-tenth of what a former french soldier gets . a 2001 court ruling pushing the government to revise the freeze had resulted in only slight pension increases , in which the cost of living in the veteran 's home country was used as a benchmark , not the pension paid in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie details hardships suffered by foreign soldiers fighting for france many in the country 's sizeable arab immigrant community were expected to flock to the new film , as were others curious to see a chapter often neglected in french history books . screening of the film came amid heightened tensions in high-immigrant suburbs around paris which had been involved in the riots which shook the country last november . on monday , 220 police raided a housing project in the southern suburb of corbeil-essonnes to arrest 11 people they suspected of participating in an ambush of two officers that left both badly beaten . nicolas sarkozy , france 's ambitious interior minister who hopes to succeed chirac in elections next year , has been aggressively promoting tough law-and-order policies and immigration controls . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bestselling novel " perfume " hits the big screen reviews of the long-awaited film version of " perfume , " the bestselling novel by patrick süskind , are ambivalent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 01.10.2006 german firms desperate for specialists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies have trouble finding the specialists they need german firms are hard-pressed to find qualified personnel for specialized positions .
at the same time , over 4.2 million people were registered as jobless in september .
this disconnect is a huge problem for both sides . " one definitely notices that it 's harder to get specialists and good experts , " said matthias pauers .
" we find average employees without a problem .
but positions for employees with outstanding , special know-how are very hard to fill at the moment . " pauers is the head of product development at matrix 42 , a german software manufacturer .
since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .
and he 's not alone .
there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .
teachers of science and medicine are also in extremely short supply . " one reason is that society and , in part , companies did n't expect the vehemence of demand for german capital goods on the world market , " said volker treier , an economist at the german association of chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" and that has to do with , above all , that one did n't know how china and india and other emerging nations would become part of the world economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has for some time had a dearth of it specialists mid-sized companies , such as matrix 42 , have an especially difficult time finding specialists , who are mostly snapped up by big firms .
and , despite the fact that millions of people are out of work in germany , most of them are unqualified for high-level jobs .
from bad to worse the situation is likely to get even worse over the next 10 years , said peter schnur of the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- .
" the most negative vision is that we will have a relatively high lack of specialists concurrent with high unemployment among people whose qualifications are low . " it 's problematic that germany 's birth rate is also very low .
the iab estimates that the 700,000 children born this year will enter the labor market when today 's 1.5 million 40-year-old germans reach retirement - less than half as many people will be available to take the vacant places in the working world . " in the mid- and long terms , we face something like a reversal of the trend , " said schnur .
" and it will be such that in the long-term future , that is , around the end of the next decade , it 's highly probable there will be a significantly lower labor force .
not with a decline in jobs but rather with fewer people who want work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unemployed do n't necessarily have the skills employers are looking for but having a job supply larger than the labor force wo n't necessarily mean lower unemployment .
if young people are n't trained to meet the requirements of highly specialized jobs , relatively high unemployment will remain a problem despite demographic developments .
the search for solutions matthias pauers and his colleagues believe they can make a difference by providing incentives for potential new employees . " in addition to paying adequately , one should invest in training employees , " pauers said .
" and one should give new employees the perspective that they , even if they are specialists , can still get further training . " companies have recognized that education is essential to ensure they can find the employees they need .
more should be done in that area , according to the dihk 's treier .
school kids should study more math and science to develop the curiosity - and the prerequisites - to pursue studies or other training in those areas . for the time being though , companies must find a way to satisfy their labor needs .
the riedlbauer group , a german firm focused on outsourcing support services and telemarketing , which has difficulties finding specialists in information technologies and stochastic , a field of mathematics , decided to tackle the problem by offering a training program .
opportunities for older people but recruiting employees abroad is another possibility .

at the same time , over 4.2 million people were registered as jobless in september .
this disconnect is a huge problem for both sides . " one definitely notices that it 's harder to get specialists and good experts , " said matthias pauers .
" we find average employees without a problem .
but positions for employees with outstanding , special know-how are very hard to fill at the moment . " pauers is the head of product development at matrix 42 , a german software manufacturer .
since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .
and he 's not alone .
there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .
teachers of science and medicine are also in extremely short supply . " one reason is that society and , in part , companies did n't expect the vehemence of demand for german capital goods on the world market , " said volker treier , an economist at the german association of chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" and that has to do with , above all , that one did n't know how china and india and other emerging nations would become part of the world economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has for some time had a dearth of it specialists mid-sized companies , such as matrix 42 , have an especially difficult time finding specialists , who are mostly snapped up by big firms .
and , despite the fact that millions of people are out of work in germany , most of them are unqualified for high-level jobs .
from bad to worse the situation is likely to get even worse over the next 10 years , said peter schnur of the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- .
" the most negative vision is that we will have a relatively high lack of specialists concurrent with high unemployment among people whose qualifications are low . " it 's problematic that germany 's birth rate is also very low .
the iab estimates that the 700,000 children born this year will enter the labor market when today 's 1.5 million 40-year-old germans reach retirement - less than half as many people will be available to take the vacant places in the working world . " in the mid- and long terms , we face something like a reversal of the trend , " said schnur .
" and it will be such that in the long-term future , that is , around the end of the next decade , it 's highly probable there will be a significantly lower labor force .
not with a decline in jobs but rather with fewer people who want work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unemployed do n't necessarily have the skills employers are looking for but having a job supply larger than the labor force wo n't necessarily mean lower unemployment .
if young people are n't trained to meet the requirements of highly specialized jobs , relatively high unemployment will remain a problem despite demographic developments .
the search for solutions matthias pauers and his colleagues believe they can make a difference by providing incentives for potential new employees . " in addition to paying adequately , one should invest in training employees , " pauers said .
" and one should give new employees the perspective that they , even if they are specialists , can still get further training . " companies have recognized that education is essential to ensure they can find the employees they need .
more should be done in that area , according to the dihk 's treier .
school kids should study more math and science to develop the curiosity - and the prerequisites - to pursue studies or other training in those areas . for the time being though , companies must find a way to satisfy their labor needs .
the riedlbauer group , a german firm focused on outsourcing support services and telemarketing , which has difficulties finding specialists in information technologies and stochastic , a field of mathematics , decided to tackle the problem by offering a training program .
opportunities for older people but recruiting employees abroad is another possibility .
ceo erich riedlbauer has hired specialists from russia and has put out feelers for it experts in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older people may yet find it easier to re-enter the working world he is , however , party of a minority among german businesspeople .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .
in november the pope will meet patriarch bartholomew i , and no doubt he will receive a warm welcome . john berwick is dw-tv 's religious affairs correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls inter-faith dialogue crucial to peace during a meeting with muslims envoys on monday , pope benedict xvi said a dialogue between christians and muslims is " vital " to peace and stability in a world threatened by religious tensions .

" under the leadership of klaus kleinfeld , the giant is lurching , " the munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung said on friday of the 48-year-old who took over the reins at siemens last year .
kleinfeld " has not had the magic touch so far , " the paper added . over the past fortnight , unions , politicians and even a bishop have hardly had a good word to say about one of germany 's industrial jewels , which last year had revenues of 75 billion euros -lrb- 95 billion dollars -rrb- with two billion euros net income . even the conservative leader of the powerful state of bavaria , edmund stoiber , stepped into the row , describing the pay hikes at the munich-based firm as " extremely regrettable " . soccer analogy backfires on chairman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would bayern be happy being the siemens of soccer ?
heinrich von pierer , siemens ' supervisory board chairman , tried to justify the move with a reference to germany 's top football team .
" at siemens , we are playing in the champions league , not in the bavarian local league .
and like bayern munich , we will only attract the top staff if we pay the right sort of money , " he said last week . it was not an argument that went down well with workers . in the telecommunications division com , 1,000 people are about to lose their jobs , hot on the heels of the 1,500 cut last year .
another 5,400 jobs are set to be slashed in the sbs information technology subsidiary , including 2,400 in germany . rumours are flying that either one or both units might be shut down . employees flood intranet with concerns " when you tell someone where you work , the first question is ' when are you going to be fired ' , " said one disgruntled employee in response to kleinfeld 's blog , which employees can access on the company 's internal intranet . another entry said : " a lot of bosses have passed through siemens ' doors .
is one of them now going to destroy everything and , what 's more , get rewarded for it ? " against this tense backdrop , benq 's decision to shut down its mobile phone manufacturing in germany inflicted further harm to siemens ' image . siemens offloaded the mobile phone operations to the taiwanese firm last year , even paying to have it taken off its hands , observers recalled on friday . unions urge wronged workers to rise up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall leader urges action at siemens unions have told benq mobile 's employees in munich and sites in western germany to vent their anger at siemens .
" they have been wronged twice , " said the head of the ig metall union , jürgen peters . the general opinion seems to be that siemens raised unrealistic expectations that the loss-making unit could be saved and then left someone else to do the dirty work . " from an economic point of view , kleinfeld has perhaps acted in the correct manner , but his reputation as someone who can turn around companies in a tough but always fair way has been lost , " said an editorial in friday 's financial times deutschland . even kleinfeld 's attempts at introducing an american-style motivational slogan in an email to staff have been mocked - " work hard , win big , have fun " has been twisted into " live hard , never rest , die young " , according to der spiegel magazine . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benq 's german workers blame former owners siemens the decision by taiwan 's benq to shut off further investment in its german subsidiary benq-siemens and seek insolvency protection has left the company 's 3,000 employees feeling betrayed .

austria 's divided far-right is set to leave the government after sunday 's elections , in what seems to be a final hurrah for nationalist politician jörg haider and a mandate for the conservatives . austrians were voting sunday in general elections expected to be among the closest in the central european state since world war ii and which could see the far right leave power after six years as the junior coalition partner . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , 61 , who took office in 2000 in a controversial alliance with the far-right , is hoping to stay in office with a change in coalition partners . political science professor walter manoschek told reporters that this would mark " the end of the most successful far-right party in europe , " referring to groupings led by nationalist jörg haider . haider has headed the party functioning as the junior partner in chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's ruling coalition since 2000 . but haider 's bzoe -lrb- alliance for austria 's future -rrb- party is not expected to win the 4 percent of total votes needed to enter parliament .
haider created the bzoe last year after losing control of the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- which he had led into national government . the fpoe , now led by one of his former lieutenants heinz-christian strache , is expected to win 10 percent of the votes sunday , making it a shoo-in for parliament . schüssel 's conservative oevp -lrb- people 's party -rrb- , which looks set to win the election , has however ruled out an alliance with the fpoe , calling it xenophobic , hostile to islam and anti-european . ' this choice was disasterous ' ironically , while haider has moved towards the center during his party 's time in government , strache has risen in his party using the populist and openly xenophobic stance that haider had used when in the opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are expected to vote conservative this time " neither the oevp nor the fpoe wish to govern together , " political scientist peter ulram from the university of vienna said . ulram said the fpoe fears that if it entered government , it would alienate its supporters who are not willing to abandon their far-right hardline . despite some political victories , including stricter immigration laws , haider 's star has been fading because of a " re-centering inherent to governing , " suffering electoral losses everywhere since 2002 except in his southern province of carinthia , ulram said . overtaken by the 36-year-old strache , haider , 56 , left the fpoe to found the bzoe , a " modern and responsible " far-right , in the spring of 2005 . in may of this year however , he handed over the party reins to his former personal secretary peter westenthaler , 38 , who is the bzoe 's top candidate in sunday 's elections .

they also addressed stockpiling of tamiflu , one of the only known drugs that can cure bird flu symptoms . avian influenza , or the h5n1 virus , began in southeast asia in mid-2003 , with the disease initially transmitted between birds .
however , the virus " crossed the species barrier " to humans .
of 244 people infected with the virus , 143 have died , according to the world health organization . vaccination priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurth hopes a pandemic could be avoided if birds are vaccinated fatalities are inevitable , and that the key to limiting the number of deaths is planning for an outbreak and having enough vaccinations for the whole population , said reinhard kurth , the president of germany 's robert koch institute .
kurth added that priority for vaccinations should be given to health workers and infants " who are more susceptible to death . ' " four million dosages can be produced in a week , so it would take 20 weeks to inoculate the entire german population , " he said .
" the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has said it is willing to invest a lot on money in vaccinations on a mass scale . " of the $ 1.9 billion -lrb- 1.49 billion euros -rrb- the international community has pledged to management of avian influenza , the eu has contributed 211 million euros .
the european commission has collaborated with member states and the world health organization to develop eu preparedness planning .
kurth said he is hopeful that one of the solutions to minimizing the outbreak will be getting farmers to vaccinate all of their birds . boosting tamilflu orders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tamiflu is regarded as the most effective drug to couteract the h5n1 virus hoffmann-la roche , the sole supplier of tamiflu has quadrupled its production capacity over the past two years .
however , current supply is thought to cover just two percent of the world population . jane lahl and isabel burckhardt from hoffmann-la roche pharmaceuticals said orders for the drug need to increase because currently there is not enough for the eu population .
lahl said drugs are the only option to containing a full-blown pandemic , but notably she is a spokeswoman for a pharmaceutical company . lahl and burckhardt both stressed that working out the logistics of distributing the drug " in an uncomplicated way " was imperative .
burckhardt also encouraged a continuation of production levels . " we can not simply open the valve when the demand increases , " she said . world-wide warning systems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication is key - experts at a conference in early 2006 massimo ciotti of the eu center for disease and prevention control response unit said eu countries should not be spending all the money on just one drug , like tamiflu , but there should be a range of measures implemented .
he promoted warning and information systems worldwide and global communication , to prevent a pandemic if there is an outbreak . ciotti also urged that it was imperative the eu establish a unified position and added that eu preparations are on track .
but there are many aspects that need to be solved , such as who would be prioritized for vaccinations if there was not enough for everyone , he said . " would it be the policeman or the child ? " he asked .
" there are issues of closing borders if tamiflu is distributed in some countries and not others .
but one thing is clear : we need to distribute vaccination quickly after an outbreak . " there are over 480 million people across the eu and there are substantial differences across different countries with demographics , geography and available services and health systems , " he said .
" now there is free movement across borders .
this means there will be free movement of diseases .

austria 's divided far-right is set to leave the government after sunday 's elections , in what seems to be a final hurrah for nationalist politician jörg haider and a mandate for the conservatives . austrians were voting sunday in general elections expected to be among the closest in the central european state since world war ii and which could see the far right leave power after six years as the junior coalition partner . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , 61 , who took office in 2000 in a controversial alliance with the far-right , is hoping to stay in office with a change in coalition partners . political science professor walter manoschek told reporters that this would mark " the end of the most successful far-right party in europe , " referring to groupings led by nationalist jörg haider . haider has headed the party functioning as the junior partner in chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's ruling coalition since 2000 . but haider 's bzoe -lrb- alliance for austria 's future -rrb- party is not expected to win the 4 percent of total votes needed to enter parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.10.2006 nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq pulling the plug on its siemens subsidiary is just one of the firm 's worries engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers . benq , the taiwanese group which acquired the siemens mobile phone subsidiary last year , said on thursday it was pulling the plug because of deepening losses , plunging 3,000 jobs into jeopardy . that came just days after siemens announced it was awarding 30-percent pay rises to its top managers . " under the leadership of klaus kleinfeld , the giant is lurching , " the munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung said on friday of the 48-year-old who took over the reins at siemens last year .
kleinfeld " has not had the magic touch so far , " the paper added . over the past fortnight , unions , politicians and even a bishop have hardly had a good word to say about one of germany 's industrial jewels , which last year had revenues of 75 billion euros -lrb- 95 billion dollars -rrb- with two billion euros net income . even the conservative leader of the powerful state of bavaria , edmund stoiber , stepped into the row , describing the pay hikes at the munich-based firm as " extremely regrettable " . soccer analogy backfires on chairman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would bayern be happy being the siemens of soccer ?
heinrich von pierer , siemens ' supervisory board chairman , tried to justify the move with a reference to germany 's top football team .
" at siemens , we are playing in the champions league , not in the bavarian local league .
and like bayern munich , we will only attract the top staff if we pay the right sort of money , " he said last week . it was not an argument that went down well with workers . in the telecommunications division com , 1,000 people are about to lose their jobs , hot on the heels of the 1,500 cut last year .
another 5,400 jobs are set to be slashed in the sbs information technology subsidiary , including 2,400 in germany . rumours are flying that either one or both units might be shut down . employees flood intranet with concerns " when you tell someone where you work , the first question is ' when are you going to be fired ' , " said one disgruntled employee in response to kleinfeld 's blog , which employees can access on the company 's internal intranet . another entry said : " a lot of bosses have passed through siemens ' doors .
is one of them now going to destroy everything and , what 's more , get rewarded for it ? " against this tense backdrop , benq 's decision to shut down its mobile phone manufacturing in germany inflicted further harm to siemens ' image . siemens offloaded the mobile phone operations to the taiwanese firm last year , even paying to have it taken off its hands , observers recalled on friday . unions urge wronged workers to rise up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall leader urges action at siemens unions have told benq mobile 's employees in munich and sites in western germany to vent their anger at siemens .
" they have been wronged twice , " said the head of the ig metall union , jürgen peters . the general opinion seems to be that siemens raised unrealistic expectations that the loss-making unit could be saved and then left someone else to do the dirty work . " from an economic point of view , kleinfeld has perhaps acted in the correct manner , but his reputation as someone who can turn around companies in a tough but always fair way has been lost , " said an editorial in friday 's financial times deutschland . even kleinfeld 's attempts at introducing an american-style motivational slogan in an email to staff have been mocked - " work hard , win big , have fun " has been twisted into " live hard , never rest , die young " , according to der spiegel magazine . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benq 's german workers blame former owners siemens the decision by taiwan 's benq to shut off further investment in its german subsidiary benq-siemens and seek insolvency protection has left the company 's 3,000 employees feeling betrayed .
-lrb- 29.09.2006 -rrb- siemens outrages politicians with executive pay hikes siemens ' plan to raise executives ' pay has led to indignation among german politicians and analysts as the company prepares to begin collective negotiations with trade unions .
-lrb- 22.09.2006 -rrb- siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .

" there is no deal .
it 's a shame because we are 90 percent there , " eu spokesman jonathan todd told reporters in brussels on sunday .
" the eu team has flown out of washington but talks will continue this week . " new us elements throw agreement in doubt finnish eu presidency spokesman marko ruonala echoed that " we are close to a deal " but added that " some new elements " introduced in the talks had hampered completion of an agreement . " the presidency will consult other member states and negotiators will come back to the issue " later this week , he added , without specifying a timetable . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , will also take up the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's business as usual for eu airlines - for now a spokesman for transatlantic carrier air france assured that the lack of an agreement had had " no impact on air france flights to the united states . " " in the absence of an agreement by september 30 , and like all the other airlines , we are continuing to transmit the passenger data , " he said . asked about the possible illegality of doing so he voiced the safety in numbers principle .
" it 's what all the other airline companies are doing . " chertoff remained upbeat , saying that the us side had sent an initial draft to the europeans which he felt satisfied fulfilled their fundamental data protection requirements . us sees a solution in the pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is developing its own ways of compiling data " i am pleased to announce that following our negotiations with representatives of the european union , i have initialled a draft formal us / eu agreement regarding the sharing of passenger name record data , " chertoff said in a statement from washington on saturday . " we expect that planes will continue to fly uninterrupted and our national security will not be impeded , " he added .
" the proposal ensures the appropriate security information will be exchanged and counter-terrorism information collected by the department will be shared , as necessary with other federal counter-terrorism agencies . " us homeland security department spokesman jarrod agen described the eu announcement that the talks had broken up without agreement as " not accurate . " transatlantic flights in legal limbo however the expiration of saturday 's deadline , set by the european court of justice , leaves transatlantic air travel in a legal limbo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us introduced strict regulations in 2003 in the name of the " war on terror " , us authorities in 2003 demanded that airlines transmit their passengers ' personal data to us security officials for all us-bound flights . airlines must provide the us authorities with dozens of details about passengers and crew - including credit card information , addresses and telephone numbers - 15 minutes before departure of a flight . in its ruling in may , the european court of justice objected to the way the original agreement was reached in 2004 , but not what was contained in it .
it set a deadline of september 30 for a new deal to be reached . eu flights could be denied access to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the impasse could cause discomfort for eu travelers now if european airlines do n't provide the info required by the us authorities they could be denied entry to the states .
if they do then they would be breaching eu rules . eu and us negotiators had resumed last-gasp talks in washington on saturday aimed at avoiding any air traffic chaos . the two sides are trying to reach agreement on the pnr data after europe 's top court quashed their previous accord on a legal technicality but allowed them to continue using it until september 30 . the talks have stumbled previously over us demands that the content of the agreement also be renegotiated ; something brussels is reluctant to do . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air passenger data transfers to us illegal , eu court rules the european union 's decision two years ago to allow transfers of airline passenger data to the united states was illegal , the eu 's top court ruled tuesday .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .

he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?

austria 's divided far-right is set to leave the government after sunday 's elections , in what seems to be a final hurrah for nationalist politician jörg haider and a mandate for the conservatives . austrians were voting sunday in general elections expected to be among the closest in the central european state since world war ii and which could see the far right leave power after six years as the junior coalition partner . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , 61 , who took office in 2000 in a controversial alliance with the far-right , is hoping to stay in office with a change in coalition partners . political science professor walter manoschek told reporters that this would mark " the end of the most successful far-right party in europe , " referring to groupings led by nationalist jörg haider . haider has headed the party functioning as the junior partner in chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's ruling coalition since 2000 . but haider 's bzoe -lrb- alliance for austria 's future -rrb- party is not expected to win the 4 percent of total votes needed to enter parliament .
haider created the bzoe last year after losing control of the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- which he had led into national government . the fpoe , now led by one of his former lieutenants heinz-christian strache , is expected to win 10 percent of the votes sunday , making it a shoo-in for parliament . schüssel 's conservative oevp -lrb- people 's party -rrb- , which looks set to win the election , has however ruled out an alliance with the fpoe , calling it xenophobic , hostile to islam and anti-european . ' this choice was disasterous ' ironically , while haider has moved towards the center during his party 's time in government , strache has risen in his party using the populist and openly xenophobic stance that haider had used when in the opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrians are expected to vote conservative this time " neither the oevp nor the fpoe wish to govern together , " political scientist peter ulram from the university of vienna said . ulram said the fpoe fears that if it entered government , it would alienate its supporters who are not willing to abandon their far-right hardline . despite some political victories , including stricter immigration laws , haider 's star has been fading because of a " re-centering inherent to governing , " suffering electoral losses everywhere since 2002 except in his southern province of carinthia , ulram said . overtaken by the 36-year-old strache , haider , 56 , left the fpoe to found the bzoe , a " modern and responsible " far-right , in the spring of 2005 . in may of this year however , he handed over the party reins to his former personal secretary peter westenthaler , 38 , who is the bzoe 's top candidate in sunday 's elections . " this choice was disastrous and definitely hurt the bzoe 's image , as westenthaler organised a campaign resembling strache 's , " ulram said . wanting a ' direct ' mandate comments by westenthaler demanding the expulsion from austria of 300,000 foreigners led justice minister karin gastinger , a moderate in the bzoe , to quit the party this week .
the fpoe and bzoe now accuse each other of treason and plagiarism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schüssel is expected to win sunday the fpoe has , however , managed to have itself placed third on voting cards , after austria 's two major parties , schüssel 's people 's party and the socialists -lrb- spoe -rrb- . haider is desperately fighting in carinthia , where he is governor , to have his party receive a " direct mandate " to get into parliament . haider still needs six points to achieve the 27 percent of votes necessary in his constituency to obtain a direct mandate , according to polls . in a return to hardline politicking , haider " is staking everything -lrb- in his campaign -rrb- on a refusal to give language rights to the slovenian minority in the name of national-german feelings , " klaus ottomeyer , a professor at the university of klagenfurt in carinthia , said . in 2000 , the fpoe 's entry into government had caused the european union to impose diplomatic sanctions on austria . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right wants to expand west encouraged by their successes at polls in the economically sagging eastern germany , far-right political parties are now trying to appeal to disgruntled voters in the western part of the country .

this disconnect is a huge problem for both sides . " one definitely notices that it 's harder to get specialists and good experts , " said matthias pauers .
" we find average employees without a problem .
but positions for employees with outstanding , special know-how are very hard to fill at the moment . " pauers is the head of product development at matrix 42 , a german software manufacturer .
since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .
and he 's not alone .
there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .
teachers of science and medicine are also in extremely short supply . " one reason is that society and , in part , companies did n't expect the vehemence of demand for german capital goods on the world market , " said volker treier , an economist at the german association of chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .

and , despite the fact that millions of people are out of work in germany , most of them are unqualified for high-level jobs .
from bad to worse the situation is likely to get even worse over the next 10 years , said peter schnur of the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- .
" the most negative vision is that we will have a relatively high lack of specialists concurrent with high unemployment among people whose qualifications are low . " it 's problematic that germany 's birth rate is also very low .
the iab estimates that the 700,000 children born this year will enter the labor market when today 's 1.5 million 40-year-old germans reach retirement - less than half as many people will be available to take the vacant places in the working world . " in the mid- and long terms , we face something like a reversal of the trend , " said schnur .
" and it will be such that in the long-term future , that is , around the end of the next decade , it 's highly probable there will be a significantly lower labor force .
not with a decline in jobs but rather with fewer people who want work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unemployed do n't necessarily have the skills employers are looking for but having a job supply larger than the labor force wo n't necessarily mean lower unemployment .
if young people are n't trained to meet the requirements of highly specialized jobs , relatively high unemployment will remain a problem despite demographic developments .
the search for solutions matthias pauers and his colleagues believe they can make a difference by providing incentives for potential new employees . " in addition to paying adequately , one should invest in training employees , " pauers said .
" and one should give new employees the perspective that they , even if they are specialists , can still get further training . " companies have recognized that education is essential to ensure they can find the employees they need .

most employers first want to exhaust the possibilities at home , and 15 percent said they will focus on older specialists when personnel shortages get worse .

" we owe it to these men who paid a price in blood , and to their children and their grandchildren , many of whom are french , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is said to have instigated paris to unfreeze pensions for non-french veterans " days of glory , " by french-algerian director rachid bouchareb , is largely credited with the decision . movie draws controversy the movie concentrates on some of the 300,000 soldiers from france 's former african colonies who made up more than half the 550,000 troops in its army fighting the germans . it is unflinching in detailing the humiliations and bias suffered by those colonial forces who were pressed to fight for the " motherland " but who were treated as second-class beings by their white superiors . the interest in the film brought attention to the pension freeze imposed by paris in 1959 , which resulted in moroccan veterans , for instance , often receiving little more than one-tenth of what a former french soldier gets . a 2001 court ruling pushing the government to revise the freeze had resulted in only slight pension increases , in which the cost of living in the veteran 's home country was used as a benchmark , not the pension paid in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie details hardships suffered by foreign soldiers fighting for france many in the country 's sizeable arab immigrant community were expected to flock to the new film , as were others curious to see a chapter often neglected in french history books . screening of the film came amid heightened tensions in high-immigrant suburbs around paris which had been involved in the riots which shook the country last november . on monday , 220 police raided a housing project in the southern suburb of corbeil-essonnes to arrest 11 people they suspected of participating in an ambush of two officers that left both badly beaten . nicolas sarkozy , france 's ambitious interior minister who hopes to succeed chirac in elections next year , has been aggressively promoting tough law-and-order policies and immigration controls . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bestselling novel " perfume " hits the big screen reviews of the long-awaited film version of " perfume , " the bestselling novel by patrick süskind , are ambivalent .

" we find average employees without a problem .

since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .

there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .

" we owe it to these men who paid a price in blood , and to their children and their grandchildren , many of whom are french , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is said to have instigated paris to unfreeze pensions for non-french veterans " days of glory , " by french-algerian director rachid bouchareb , is largely credited with the decision . movie draws controversy the movie concentrates on some of the 300,000 soldiers from france 's former african colonies who made up more than half the 550,000 troops in its army fighting the germans . it is unflinching in detailing the humiliations and bias suffered by those colonial forces who were pressed to fight for the " motherland " but who were treated as second-class beings by their white superiors . the interest in the film brought attention to the pension freeze imposed by paris in 1959 , which resulted in moroccan veterans , for instance , often receiving little more than one-tenth of what a former french soldier gets . a 2001 court ruling pushing the government to revise the freeze had resulted in only slight pension increases , in which the cost of living in the veteran 's home country was used as a benchmark , not the pension paid in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie details hardships suffered by foreign soldiers fighting for france many in the country 's sizeable arab immigrant community were expected to flock to the new film , as were others curious to see a chapter often neglected in french history books . screening of the film came amid heightened tensions in high-immigrant suburbs around paris which had been involved in the riots which shook the country last november . on monday , 220 police raided a housing project in the southern suburb of corbeil-essonnes to arrest 11 people they suspected of participating in an ambush of two officers that left both badly beaten . nicolas sarkozy , france 's ambitious interior minister who hopes to succeed chirac in elections next year , has been aggressively promoting tough law-and-order policies and immigration controls . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bestselling novel " perfume " hits the big screen reviews of the long-awaited film version of " perfume , " the bestselling novel by patrick süskind , are ambivalent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 01.10.2006 german firms desperate for specialists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies have trouble finding the specialists they need german firms are hard-pressed to find qualified personnel for specialized positions .
at the same time , over 4.2 million people were registered as jobless in september .
this disconnect is a huge problem for both sides . " one definitely notices that it 's harder to get specialists and good experts , " said matthias pauers .
" we find average employees without a problem .
but positions for employees with outstanding , special know-how are very hard to fill at the moment . " pauers is the head of product development at matrix 42 , a german software manufacturer .
since the beginning of the year , he has only found very few job applicants who are qualified to work in the field .
and he 's not alone .
there 's also a dearth of specialists in mechanical engineering , electronics , pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry .
german companies have ever more problems filling positions that require high qualifications .
teachers of science and medicine are also in extremely short supply . " one reason is that society and , in part , companies did n't expect the vehemence of demand for german capital goods on the world market , " said volker treier , an economist at the german association of chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" and that has to do with , above all , that one did n't know how china and india and other emerging nations would become part of the world economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has for some time had a dearth of it specialists mid-sized companies , such as matrix 42 , have an especially difficult time finding specialists , who are mostly snapped up by big firms .
and , despite the fact that millions of people are out of work in germany , most of them are unqualified for high-level jobs .
from bad to worse the situation is likely to get even worse over the next 10 years , said peter schnur of the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- .
" the most negative vision is that we will have a relatively high lack of specialists concurrent with high unemployment among people whose qualifications are low . " it 's problematic that germany 's birth rate is also very low .
the iab estimates that the 700,000 children born this year will enter the labor market when today 's 1.5 million 40-year-old germans reach retirement - less than half as many people will be available to take the vacant places in the working world . " in the mid- and long terms , we face something like a reversal of the trend , " said schnur .
" and it will be such that in the long-term future , that is , around the end of the next decade , it 's highly probable there will be a significantly lower labor force .
not with a decline in jobs but rather with fewer people who want work . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unemployed do n't necessarily have the skills employers are looking for but having a job supply larger than the labor force wo n't necessarily mean lower unemployment .
if young people are n't trained to meet the requirements of highly specialized jobs , relatively high unemployment will remain a problem despite demographic developments .
the search for solutions matthias pauers and his colleagues believe they can make a difference by providing incentives for potential new employees . " in addition to paying adequately , one should invest in training employees , " pauers said .
" and one should give new employees the perspective that they , even if they are specialists , can still get further training . " companies have recognized that education is essential to ensure they can find the employees they need .
more should be done in that area , according to the dihk 's treier .
school kids should study more math and science to develop the curiosity - and the prerequisites - to pursue studies or other training in those areas . for the time being though , companies must find a way to satisfy their labor needs .
the riedlbauer group , a german firm focused on outsourcing support services and telemarketing , which has difficulties finding specialists in information technologies and stochastic , a field of mathematics , decided to tackle the problem by offering a training program .
opportunities for older people but recruiting employees abroad is another possibility .
ceo erich riedlbauer has hired specialists from russia and has put out feelers for it experts in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older people may yet find it easier to re-enter the working world he is , however , party of a minority among german businesspeople .
only 6 percent of german companies would consider searching for specialist staff abroad , according to a dihk poll .
most employers first want to exhaust the possibilities at home , and 15 percent said they will focus on older specialists when personnel shortages get worse .
more than half of those surveyed said that training was the way to deal with the lack of specialists in the future . that may just translate into new opportunities for older , unemployed people , who have a particularly hard time re-entering the professional world in germany . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no brakes on germany 's population freefall a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .

but orthodox christians , whom he will soon visit in turkey , are bound to give him a warm welcome because of it , writes dw 's john berwick . the pope has apologized .
not for something done by fellow-christians centuries ago , as his predecessor john paul ii did on good friday 2000 .
benedict xvi has apologized for something he himself did earlier this month .
now that 's truly remarkable .
pious popes may go to confession , but they do n't generally make public apologies .
true , benedict has n't actually admitted he did anything wrong , but he has said he 's sorry that his remarks on violence and islam earlier this month in a lecture given at regensburg university were " misconstrued " and that they hurt muslims .
the press seems to have decided that this is an " apology . "
and most muslim leaders have accepted it as such . the apology was necessitated by the violent reaction in the muslim world to the pope 's quoting the 14th century byzantine emperor manuel ii paleologus on the subject of christianity and islam : " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " . muslims were outraged at the pontiff 's quoting the mediaeval emperor .
they rioted in pakistan , torched churches in the west bank , and murdered a catholic nun in somalia .
ever since the regensburg lecture , the vatican has been scrambling to limit the damage .
benedict xvi has said that the quotation does not reflect his own views .
he summoned islamic envoys to his summer residence in castelgandolfo to assure them of his deep respect for their religion .
but the question remains : why did he do it in the first place ?
why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .

why did he begin a lecture on faith and reason by quoting the obscure greek emperor manuel ii ? a naive pontiff ? it may be true , as the vatican insists , that the press reported the quotation out-of-context .
but did n't the pontiff realize it was inflammatory ?
is it plausible that he forgot for a moment that he is a public figure in the age of 24-hour tv news ?
anything he says -lrb- or quotes -rrb- is a potential " sound-bite . "
are we to believe that he simply lapsed into his old role as a university professor and allowed himself a provocative quotation or two to make his students sit up and take notice ?
is benedict xvi really that naive ?
and who was this manuel , anyway ? manuel ii paleologus -lrb- 1350-1425 -rrb- was one of the last christian rulers of byzantium .
he was the father of the last byzantine emperor , constantine xi , who is revered by greek orthodox christians as a saint .
there 's even a statue of the " ethno-martyr " st constantine in front of athens cathedral .
during manuel ii 's reign , the turks had conquered most of the byzantine provinces , devastated and pillaged greek cities , and enslaved thousands of christian women and children .
in 1394 , the sultan laid siege to constantinople , inflicting hunger and suffering on the christian residents of the city for eight years .
naturally , the emperor had a rather jaundiced view of islam .
so why did the pope quote manuel ii as an authority on " jihad " ? constantinople vs. istanbul unlike his predecessor john paul ii , benedict is not a pope who enjoys travel .
yet , we are told , he has a burning desire to visit turkey .
a trip is planned for november .
now , this is the man who , as cardinal prefect of the congregation for the faith – the chief theologian of the catholic church , said turkey had no place in the european union and should rather join a league of muslim states .
it would seem therefore that he is not going to turkey because he views that country as a bridge between the middle east and europe , as ankara likes to present itself . it is not even dialogue with muslims that benedict will be seeking in istanbul – though he does see that as an urgent political issue .
the main purpose of his trip is to visit the most senior cleric of the eastern orthodox church , the greek patriarch of constantinople , bartholomew i. the patriarch is the chief spokesman of the eastern orthodox communion .
his official title is as impressive as anything the pope might claim : " his most sublime all-holiness the archbishop of constantinople new rome and ecumenical patriarch . "
and his most important function is to preserve the unity of the eastern church , just as the pope 's main function is to preserve the unity of the western church . desirable unification benedict xvi has an ambitious agenda .
he wants to reclaim europe for christianity .
that project may seem unrealistic , but a first step would be to reunite divided christians .
in the pope 's view , theological differences between catholicism and protestantism are so great that little progress can be expected on that front .
but eastern orthodoxy , the second largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church , is a different matter . there are no major theological differences separating the two communions .
as the catholic encyclopedia says , this is " perhaps the only prominent case of a pure schism , of a breach of inter-communion caused by anger and bad feeling , not by a rival theology . "
some form of reunion is not only feasible ; from benedict 's point of view , it is highly desirable . benedict has a natural affinity to many aspects of the eastern orthodox tradition .
he has criticized attempts in his own church during the twentieth century to modernize the liturgy ; the eastern orthodox liturgies have resisted reform .
the pope has criticized the historical-critical approach to biblical studies , pioneered by german protestant scholars in the nineteenth century and developed by catholic exegetes in the twentieth . eastern orthodox scholars are equally skeptical of this " scientific " approach to scripture . so what is keeping them apart ?
over the centuries , the disagreement between the two communions has mainly focused on papal claims to authority and precedence .
significantly , benedict dispensed with the traditional papal title " patriarch of the west " at his election – as though to remove that difficulty . a gesture of solidarity the pope is 79 years old and in poor health .
when he was elected , many said openly that he was an interim pope .
he knows that he wo n't live to see his dream of a re-evangelized europe come true .
but the first step in that agenda – unity with the eastern orthodox communion – appears within his grasp .
his reference in the regensburg lecture to the beleaguered byzantine emperor manuel ii , heroically resisting the hostile tide of islam , may have angered muslims around the world , but it will have been understood by the world 's 240 million eastern orthodox christians as a dramatic gesture of solidarity . the pope has apologized .
the reaction of muslims has probably been stronger than the vatican had anticipated ; but the long-term damage to christian-muslim relations seems less than it feared .
i believe it was a calculated risk .
in november the pope will meet patriarch bartholomew i , and no doubt he will receive a warm welcome . john berwick is dw-tv 's religious affairs correspondent -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls inter-faith dialogue crucial to peace during a meeting with muslims envoys on monday , pope benedict xvi said a dialogue between christians and muslims is " vital " to peace and stability in a world threatened by religious tensions .

" under the leadership of klaus kleinfeld , the giant is lurching , " the munich-based sueddeutsche zeitung said on friday of the 48-year-old who took over the reins at siemens last year .
kleinfeld " has not had the magic touch so far , " the paper added . over the past fortnight , unions , politicians and even a bishop have hardly had a good word to say about one of germany 's industrial jewels , which last year had revenues of 75 billion euros -lrb- 95 billion dollars -rrb- with two billion euros net income . even the conservative leader of the powerful state of bavaria , edmund stoiber , stepped into the row , describing the pay hikes at the munich-based firm as " extremely regrettable " . soccer analogy backfires on chairman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would bayern be happy being the siemens of soccer ?
heinrich von pierer , siemens ' supervisory board chairman , tried to justify the move with a reference to germany 's top football team .
" at siemens , we are playing in the champions league , not in the bavarian local league .
and like bayern munich , we will only attract the top staff if we pay the right sort of money , " he said last week . it was not an argument that went down well with workers . in the telecommunications division com , 1,000 people are about to lose their jobs , hot on the heels of the 1,500 cut last year .
another 5,400 jobs are set to be slashed in the sbs information technology subsidiary , including 2,400 in germany . rumours are flying that either one or both units might be shut down . employees flood intranet with concerns " when you tell someone where you work , the first question is ' when are you going to be fired ' , " said one disgruntled employee in response to kleinfeld 's blog , which employees can access on the company 's internal intranet . another entry said : " a lot of bosses have passed through siemens ' doors .
is one of them now going to destroy everything and , what 's more , get rewarded for it ? " against this tense backdrop , benq 's decision to shut down its mobile phone manufacturing in germany inflicted further harm to siemens ' image . siemens offloaded the mobile phone operations to the taiwanese firm last year , even paying to have it taken off its hands , observers recalled on friday . unions urge wronged workers to rise up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall leader urges action at siemens unions have told benq mobile 's employees in munich and sites in western germany to vent their anger at siemens .
" they have been wronged twice , " said the head of the ig metall union , jürgen peters . the general opinion seems to be that siemens raised unrealistic expectations that the loss-making unit could be saved and then left someone else to do the dirty work . " from an economic point of view , kleinfeld has perhaps acted in the correct manner , but his reputation as someone who can turn around companies in a tough but always fair way has been lost , " said an editorial in friday 's financial times deutschland . even kleinfeld 's attempts at introducing an american-style motivational slogan in an email to staff have been mocked - " work hard , win big , have fun " has been twisted into " live hard , never rest , die young " , according to der spiegel magazine . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benq 's german workers blame former owners siemens the decision by taiwan 's benq to shut off further investment in its german subsidiary benq-siemens and seek insolvency protection has left the company 's 3,000 employees feeling betrayed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.10.2006 health experts urge eu to prepare for more bird flu cases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous outbreaks have been contained in europe , but more are predicted health experts met to review how well the eu is prepared for an outbreak of avian influenza and what can be done to limit the damage if this happens . health professionals meeting at the 2006 european congress on disaster management in bonn all agreed that it is not a question if an outbreak of bird flu will happen , but when . they recommended establishing a common eu position and making sure there are clear communication channels between member countries .
they also addressed stockpiling of tamiflu , one of the only known drugs that can cure bird flu symptoms . avian influenza , or the h5n1 virus , began in southeast asia in mid-2003 , with the disease initially transmitted between birds .
however , the virus " crossed the species barrier " to humans .
of 244 people infected with the virus , 143 have died , according to the world health organization . vaccination priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurth hopes a pandemic could be avoided if birds are vaccinated fatalities are inevitable , and that the key to limiting the number of deaths is planning for an outbreak and having enough vaccinations for the whole population , said reinhard kurth , the president of germany 's robert koch institute .
kurth added that priority for vaccinations should be given to health workers and infants " who are more susceptible to death . ' " four million dosages can be produced in a week , so it would take 20 weeks to inoculate the entire german population , " he said .
" the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has said it is willing to invest a lot on money in vaccinations on a mass scale . " of the $ 1.9 billion -lrb- 1.49 billion euros -rrb- the international community has pledged to management of avian influenza , the eu has contributed 211 million euros .
the european commission has collaborated with member states and the world health organization to develop eu preparedness planning .
kurth said he is hopeful that one of the solutions to minimizing the outbreak will be getting farmers to vaccinate all of their birds . boosting tamilflu orders ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tamiflu is regarded as the most effective drug to couteract the h5n1 virus hoffmann-la roche , the sole supplier of tamiflu has quadrupled its production capacity over the past two years .
however , current supply is thought to cover just two percent of the world population . jane lahl and isabel burckhardt from hoffmann-la roche pharmaceuticals said orders for the drug need to increase because currently there is not enough for the eu population .
lahl said drugs are the only option to containing a full-blown pandemic , but notably she is a spokeswoman for a pharmaceutical company . lahl and burckhardt both stressed that working out the logistics of distributing the drug " in an uncomplicated way " was imperative .
burckhardt also encouraged a continuation of production levels . " we can not simply open the valve when the demand increases , " she said . world-wide warning systems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : communication is key - experts at a conference in early 2006 massimo ciotti of the eu center for disease and prevention control response unit said eu countries should not be spending all the money on just one drug , like tamiflu , but there should be a range of measures implemented .
he promoted warning and information systems worldwide and global communication , to prevent a pandemic if there is an outbreak . ciotti also urged that it was imperative the eu establish a unified position and added that eu preparations are on track .
but there are many aspects that need to be solved , such as who would be prioritized for vaccinations if there was not enough for everyone , he said . " would it be the policeman or the child ? " he asked .
" there are issues of closing borders if tamiflu is distributed in some countries and not others .
but one thing is clear : we need to distribute vaccination quickly after an outbreak . " there are over 480 million people across the eu and there are substantial differences across different countries with demographics , geography and available services and health systems , " he said .
" now there is free movement across borders .
this means there will be free movement of diseases .

it is hoped the underwater langeled pipeline - the world 's longest - will provide a fifth of the uk 's peak winter fuel demand over the next 40 years .
the £ 5.5bn link connects nyhamna to easington in east yorkshire .
tony blair and jens stoltenberg , his norwegian counterpart , will attend a completion ceremony later this month .
underground caverns commercial deliveries through the southern leg of langeled from the sleipner gas processing platform are set to begin on sunday .
the project will see gas stored in huge caverns underground and will be taken out of the reservoir as and when required .
the pipeline will eventually stretch to ormen lange , the largest gas field under development on the norwegian continental shelf .
the pipeline 's construction , which began in 2004 , is the world 's biggest single engineering project .
it has been backed by centrica and energy giants statoil , norsk hydro , royal dutchshell and conocophillips .
it is hoped the pipeline will ease concerns over dwindling supplies which have sent gas prices in the uk soaring over the last two years .
the uk 's own reserves of natural gas are dwindling so it is necessary to import gas from abroad , but gas supplies from russia have proved unreliable .

it is hoped the underwater langeled pipeline - the world 's longest - will provide a fifth of the uk 's peak winter fuel demand over the next 40 years .
the £ 5.5bn link connects nyhamna to easington in east yorkshire .
tony blair and jens stoltenberg , his norwegian counterpart , will attend a completion ceremony later this month .
underground caverns commercial deliveries through the southern leg of langeled from the sleipner gas processing platform are set to begin on sunday .
the project will see gas stored in huge caverns underground and will be taken out of the reservoir as and when required .
the pipeline will eventually stretch to ormen lange , the largest gas field under development on the norwegian continental shelf .
the pipeline 's construction , which began in 2004 , is the world 's biggest single engineering project .
it has been backed by centrica and energy giants statoil , norsk hydro , royal dutchshell and conocophillips .
it is hoped the pipeline will ease concerns over dwindling supplies which have sent gas prices in the uk soaring over the last two years .
the uk 's own reserves of natural gas are dwindling so it is necessary to import gas from abroad , but gas supplies from russia have proved unreliable .

he 's going to have a nose job , following in the footsteps of his mother , his brother , his aunt and his cousin who have all had cosmetic surgery .
" now it 's really normal but of course 10 years ago if you were a boy and had a nose job everyone would laugh at you and make fun of you , " admits hussein .
" but now it 's not like that - lots of people are doing it , " he adds .
hussein , who is a university student with a wealthy father involved in trade with china , says he met a woman the other day who asked why a boy needed to worry about his looks so much .
" i was shocked because everyone would love to have a more beautiful face , " he says .
it 's becoming increasingly common for iranian men to have cosmetic surgery .
at first it was iranian women who wanted nose jobs because strict islamic dress regulations meant the only thing peeking out was their face and they wanted to make the best of it .
since the revolution in 1979 , iran has become one of the world 's leading centres for cosmetic surgery with three thousand plastic surgeons operating in tehran alone .
stress hussein is taken into the operating room and the surgeon , dr magid navab , installs a suction tube in hussein 's nose to draw away the blood . "
i am a little stressed because it 's my son and not me ...
i trust the doctor though because he operated on my nose " parinaz , hussein 's mother at $ 3,000 an operation , not everyone in iran can afford a new nose .
and it takes some guts if you know how gruesome it 's going to be .
sitting outside the operating room we can hear a " tap , tap " noise of hussein 's nose being broken and refashioned .
" i am a little stressed because it 's my son and not me , " says hussein 's mother parinaz .
she is meticulously dressed at this early hour of the morning in an elaborate , beaded lace blouse and embroidered chiffon headscarf .
" i trust the doctor though because he operated on my nose , " she says .
at times dr navab closes his eyes to concentrate and feels his way around hussein 's nose .
noses , eyelids , facelifts he has performed so many of these operations - more than 30,000 in his career so far - that he can literally do it with his eyes shut .
compare this number with the association of plastic surgeons in britain .
all their members together did only seven thousand nose jobs last year . "
it 's become a fashion - a competition because a boy wants to compete with another over a girl " dr magid navab dr navab says he only does three operations - noses , eyelids and face lifts - and his schedule is completely full the year round .
and increasingly his patients are iranian men .
" you do n't see as many men with nose jobs in london or paris or germany but today the numbers having cosmetic surgery -lsb- in iran -rsb- is amazing , " he says .
you might have thought a country ruled by religious precepts would frown on plastic surgery as an unnecessary vanity .
not so .
dr navab explains that some of his patients are indeed congenitally ugly and need surgery to cope psychologically with their lives and he thinks he has operated on the odd cleric too , though they come to see him in plain clothes .
fashion statement other patients are more frivolous .
" it 's become a fashion - a competition because a boy wants to compete with another over a girl , " dr navab says , adding that there are also more and more cases of middle aged men who want to keep up with their young girlfriends .
a week after the operation hussein is preparing to have the bandages on his nose removed .
he lives with his parents in an apartment in north tehran furnished with large gilt-rimmed furniture , plush silk carpets and chandeliers .
as we discuss all their operations , the television blasts out persian pop singers from the los angeles satellite channels crooning about how much they love iran .
" i had a hump on my nose and it was removed and then the second operation i had the tip of my nose reduced and my nostrils made smaller , " explains syed amir hashemi , hussein 's older brother .
he also had two operations on his jaw which meant he had to eat through a straw for many weeks after the surgery .
veterans rather coyly they bring out photographs of them from before the surgery and it 's hard to recognise amir hashemi or his mother .
as veterans of this process , they 've been preparing hussein for what to expect when the bandages come off .
" i said you ca n't play football for at least one year and you ca n't go jogging because the new nose needs some time to settle , " says amir hashemi .
they also know that most patients hate their new noses when the bandages come off and it takes some time to get used to their new looks .
hussein and his mother arrive at the doctor 's surgery bearing flowers as a gift .
the bandages are removed , and surprisingly hussein 's now smaller nose shows no bruising - it 's just a little swollen .
a little hand held vanity mirror is produced for hussein to peer into .
" it 's all very good " , he keeps saying , smiling at the reflection of his new nose .

at first it was iranian women who wanted nose jobs because strict islamic dress regulations meant the only thing peeking out was their face and they wanted to make the best of it .
since the revolution in 1979 , iran has become one of the world 's leading centres for cosmetic surgery with three thousand plastic surgeons operating in tehran alone .
stress hussein is taken into the operating room and the surgeon , dr magid navab , installs a suction tube in hussein 's nose to draw away the blood .
i am a little stressed because it 's my son and not me ...
i trust the doctor though because he operated on my nose parinaz , hussein 's mother at $ 3,000 an operation , not everyone in iran can afford a new nose .
and it takes some guts if you know how gruesome it 's going to be .
sitting outside the operating room we can hear a " tap , tap " noise of hussein 's nose being broken and refashioned .
" i am a little stressed because it 's my son and not me , " says hussein 's mother parinaz .
she is meticulously dressed at this early hour of the morning in an elaborate , beaded lace blouse and embroidered chiffon headscarf .
" i trust the doctor though because he operated on my nose , " she says .
at times dr navab closes his eyes to concentrate and feels his way around hussein 's nose .
noses , eyelids , facelifts he has performed so many of these operations - more than 30,000 in his career so far - that he can literally do it with his eyes shut .
compare this number with the association of plastic surgeons in britain .
all their members together did only seven thousand nose jobs last year .
it 's become a fashion - a competition because a boy wants to compete with another over a girl dr magid navab dr navab says he only does three operations - noses , eyelids and face lifts - and his schedule is completely full the year round .
and increasingly his patients are iranian men .
" you do n't see as many men with nose jobs in london or paris or germany but today the numbers having cosmetic surgery -lsb- in iran -rsb- is amazing , " he says .
you might have thought a country ruled by religious precepts would frown on plastic surgery as an unnecessary vanity .
not so .
dr navab explains that some of his patients are indeed congenitally ugly and need surgery to cope psychologically with their lives and he thinks he has operated on the odd cleric too , though they come to see him in plain clothes .
fashion statement other patients are more frivolous .
" it 's become a fashion - a competition because a boy wants to compete with another over a girl , " dr navab says , adding that there are also more and more cases of middle aged men who want to keep up with their young girlfriends .
dr magid navab has performed 30,000 such operation in his career a week after the operation hussein is preparing to have the bandages on his nose removed .
he lives with his parents in an apartment in north tehran furnished with large gilt-rimmed furniture , plush silk carpets and chandeliers .
as we discuss all their operations , the television blasts out persian pop singers from the los angeles satellite channels crooning about how much they love iran .
" i had a hump on my nose and it was removed and then the second operation i had the tip of my nose reduced and my nostrils made smaller , " explains syed amir hashemi , hussein 's older brother .
he also had two operations on his jaw which meant he had to eat through a straw for many weeks after the surgery .
veterans rather coyly they bring out photographs of them from before the surgery and it 's hard to recognise amir hashemi or his mother .
as veterans of this process , they 've been preparing hussein for what to expect when the bandages come off .
" i said you ca n't play football for at least one year and you ca n't go jogging because the new nose needs some time to settle , " says amir hashemi .
they also know that most patients hate their new noses when the bandages come off and it takes some time to get used to their new looks .
hussein and his mother arrive at the doctor 's surgery bearing flowers as a gift .
the bandages are removed , and surprisingly hussein 's now smaller nose shows no bruising - it 's just a little swollen .
a little hand held vanity mirror is produced for hussein to peer into .
" it 's all very good " , he keeps saying , smiling at the reflection of his new nose .

he lives with his parents in an apartment in north tehran furnished with large gilt-rimmed furniture , plush silk carpets and chandeliers .
as we discuss all their operations , the television blasts out persian pop singers from the los angeles satellite channels crooning about how much they love iran .
" i had a hump on my nose and it was removed and then the second operation i had the tip of my nose reduced and my nostrils made smaller , " explains syed amir hashemi , hussein 's older brother .
he also had two operations on his jaw which meant he had to eat through a straw for many weeks after the surgery .
veterans rather coyly they bring out photographs of them from before the surgery and it 's hard to recognise amir hashemi or his mother .
as veterans of this process , they 've been preparing hussein for what to expect when the bandages come off .
" i said you ca n't play football for at least one year and you ca n't go jogging because the new nose needs some time to settle , " says amir hashemi .
they also know that most patients hate their new noses when the bandages come off and it takes some time to get used to their new looks .
hussein and his mother arrive at the doctor 's surgery bearing flowers as a gift .
the bandages are removed , and surprisingly hussein 's now smaller nose shows no bruising - it 's just a little swollen .
a little hand held vanity mirror is produced for hussein to peer into .
" it 's all very good " , he keeps saying , smiling at the reflection of his new nose .

he 's going to have a nose job , following in the footsteps of his mother , his brother , his aunt and his cousin who have all had cosmetic surgery .
hussein surveys his new nose for the first time " now it 's really normal but of course 10 years ago if you were a boy and had a nose job everyone would laugh at you and make fun of you , " admits hussein .
" but now it 's not like that - lots of people are doing it , " he adds .
hussein , who is a university student with a wealthy father involved in trade with china , says he met a woman the other day who asked why a boy needed to worry about his looks so much .
" i was shocked because everyone would love to have a more beautiful face , " he says .
it 's becoming increasingly common for iranian men to have cosmetic surgery .
at first it was iranian women who wanted nose jobs because strict islamic dress regulations meant the only thing peeking out was their face and they wanted to make the best of it .
since the revolution in 1979 , iran has become one of the world 's leading centres for cosmetic surgery with three thousand plastic surgeons operating in tehran alone .
stress hussein is taken into the operating room and the surgeon , dr magid navab , installs a suction tube in hussein 's nose to draw away the blood .
i am a little stressed because it 's my son and not me ...
i trust the doctor though because he operated on my nose parinaz , hussein 's mother at $ 3,000 an operation , not everyone in iran can afford a new nose .
and it takes some guts if you know how gruesome it 's going to be .
sitting outside the operating room we can hear a " tap , tap " noise of hussein 's nose being broken and refashioned .
" i am a little stressed because it 's my son and not me , " says hussein 's mother parinaz .
she is meticulously dressed at this early hour of the morning in an elaborate , beaded lace blouse and embroidered chiffon headscarf .
" i trust the doctor though because he operated on my nose , " she says .
at times dr navab closes his eyes to concentrate and feels his way around hussein 's nose .
noses , eyelids , facelifts he has performed so many of these operations - more than 30,000 in his career so far - that he can literally do it with his eyes shut .
compare this number with the association of plastic surgeons in britain .
all their members together did only seven thousand nose jobs last year .
it 's become a fashion - a competition because a boy wants to compete with another over a girl dr magid navab dr navab says he only does three operations - noses , eyelids and face lifts - and his schedule is completely full the year round .
and increasingly his patients are iranian men .
" you do n't see as many men with nose jobs in london or paris or germany but today the numbers having cosmetic surgery -lsb- in iran -rsb- is amazing , " he says .
you might have thought a country ruled by religious precepts would frown on plastic surgery as an unnecessary vanity .
not so .
dr navab explains that some of his patients are indeed congenitally ugly and need surgery to cope psychologically with their lives and he thinks he has operated on the odd cleric too , though they come to see him in plain clothes .
fashion statement other patients are more frivolous .

he 's going to have a nose job , following in the footsteps of his mother , his brother , his aunt and his cousin who have all had cosmetic surgery .
hussein surveys his new nose for the first time " now it 's really normal but of course 10 years ago if you were a boy and had a nose job everyone would laugh at you and make fun of you , " admits hussein .
" but now it 's not like that - lots of people are doing it , " he adds .
hussein , who is a university student with a wealthy father involved in trade with china , says he met a woman the other day who asked why a boy needed to worry about his looks so much .
" i was shocked because everyone would love to have a more beautiful face , " he says .
it 's becoming increasingly common for iranian men to have cosmetic surgery .
at first it was iranian women who wanted nose jobs because strict islamic dress regulations meant the only thing peeking out was their face and they wanted to make the best of it .
since the revolution in 1979 , iran has become one of the world 's leading centres for cosmetic surgery with three thousand plastic surgeons operating in tehran alone .
stress hussein is taken into the operating room and the surgeon , dr magid navab , installs a suction tube in hussein 's nose to draw away the blood .
i am a little stressed because it 's my son and not me ...
i trust the doctor though because he operated on my nose parinaz , hussein 's mother at $ 3,000 an operation , not everyone in iran can afford a new nose .
and it takes some guts if you know how gruesome it 's going to be .
sitting outside the operating room we can hear a " tap , tap " noise of hussein 's nose being broken and refashioned .
" i am a little stressed because it 's my son and not me , " says hussein 's mother parinaz .
she is meticulously dressed at this early hour of the morning in an elaborate , beaded lace blouse and embroidered chiffon headscarf .
" i trust the doctor though because he operated on my nose , " she says .
at times dr navab closes his eyes to concentrate and feels his way around hussein 's nose .
noses , eyelids , facelifts he has performed so many of these operations - more than 30,000 in his career so far - that he can literally do it with his eyes shut .
compare this number with the association of plastic surgeons in britain .
all their members together did only seven thousand nose jobs last year .
it 's become a fashion - a competition because a boy wants to compete with another over a girl dr magid navab dr navab says he only does three operations - noses , eyelids and face lifts - and his schedule is completely full the year round .
and increasingly his patients are iranian men .
" you do n't see as many men with nose jobs in london or paris or germany but today the numbers having cosmetic surgery -lsb- in iran -rsb- is amazing , " he says .
you might have thought a country ruled by religious precepts would frown on plastic surgery as an unnecessary vanity .
not so .
dr navab explains that some of his patients are indeed congenitally ugly and need surgery to cope psychologically with their lives and he thinks he has operated on the odd cleric too , though they come to see him in plain clothes .
fashion statement other patients are more frivolous .
" it 's become a fashion - a competition because a boy wants to compete with another over a girl , " dr navab says , adding that there are also more and more cases of middle aged men who want to keep up with their young girlfriends .
dr magid navab has performed 30,000 such operation in his career a week after the operation hussein is preparing to have the bandages on his nose removed .
he lives with his parents in an apartment in north tehran furnished with large gilt-rimmed furniture , plush silk carpets and chandeliers .
as we discuss all their operations , the television blasts out persian pop singers from the los angeles satellite channels crooning about how much they love iran .
" i had a hump on my nose and it was removed and then the second operation i had the tip of my nose reduced and my nostrils made smaller , " explains syed amir hashemi , hussein 's older brother .
he also had two operations on his jaw which meant he had to eat through a straw for many weeks after the surgery .
veterans rather coyly they bring out photographs of them from before the surgery and it 's hard to recognise amir hashemi or his mother .
as veterans of this process , they 've been preparing hussein for what to expect when the bandages come off .
" i said you ca n't play football for at least one year and you ca n't go jogging because the new nose needs some time to settle , " says amir hashemi .
they also know that most patients hate their new noses when the bandages come off and it takes some time to get used to their new looks .
hussein and his mother arrive at the doctor 's surgery bearing flowers as a gift .
the bandages are removed , and surprisingly hussein 's now smaller nose shows no bruising - it 's just a little swollen .
a little hand held vanity mirror is produced for hussein to peer into .
" it 's all very good " , he keeps saying , smiling at the reflection of his new nose .

the new laws - the employment equality -lrb- age -rrb- regulations 2006 - are the result of a european directive on employment .
they make it unlawful to discriminate against workers under the age of 65 on the grounds of age .
the rules will affect recruitment , training , promotion , redundancy , retirement , pay and pension provision . "
it 's going to require quite a fundamental change in mindset " jane amphlett quick guide : age laws send us your comments jane amphlett , who specialises in employment law , told the bbc the changes would be far-reaching .
" i know that employment lawyers have a reputation for trying to whip up a bit of a storm and a bit of business out of any new legislation that comes in , but i think the key issue here is that it 's going to cover anyone from application for a job right through to retirement and beyond , " she said .
" it 's going to require quite a fundamental change in mindset . "
under the new laws , workers will have the right to request that they work beyond age 65 , while employers will have to give their staff six months notice of when they expect them to retire .
they will also have to treat all workers equally when it comes to training , regardless of age phrases in adverts seeking " enthusiastic young staff " or " mature individuals " , for example , will be banned .
recruitment schemes aimed at graduates will have to be changed , while sifting job applications by age must also end .
employment tribunals from now on anyone who feels they have suffered because of their age will be able to take a case to an employment tribunal , where the penalty will be an unlimited fine .
some employers fear they will face many more tribunal cases .
a recent survey by the employers forum on ageing found that 40 % of employers in the uk think that once the new laws come in , age discrimination will be a feature of more than half of tribunal cases .
despite the attention given to older people being forced out of the workforce , the laws will apply just as much to young people .
dumping the youngest workers into the lowest paid jobs while they are allegedly " learning " could be challenged .
not all of the government 's plans are being implemented in one go .
it recently decided to postpone until the start of december the changes that will be required by pension funds .
there will now be a further period of consultation before new guidance is published and the pension element of the new laws comes into effect .
there could be some unintended consequences for other benefits offered by employers .
for instance those who offer benefits like health or life insurance up to a current retirement age of 60 may find they are now charged much more by insurance firms to cover their staff to 65 .
" all employers who offer any protection benefits for their staff will have to make sure the schemes are written to 65 or they could end up denying benefits to older workers , " says peter coussens , of financial advisers kynaston-carnoustie .

the new laws - the employment equality -lrb- age -rrb- regulations 2006 - are the result of a european directive on employment .
they make it unlawful to discriminate against workers under the age of 65 on the grounds of age .
the rules will affect recruitment , training , promotion , redundancy , retirement , pay and pension provision .
it 's going to require quite a fundamental change in mindset jane amphlett quick guide : age laws send us your comments jane amphlett , who specialises in employment law , told the bbc the changes would be far-reaching .
" i know that employment lawyers have a reputation for trying to whip up a bit of a storm and a bit of business out of any new legislation that comes in , but i think the key issue here is that it 's going to cover anyone from application for a job right through to retirement and beyond , " she said .
" it 's going to require quite a fundamental change in mindset . "
under the new laws , workers will have the right to request that they work beyond age 65 , while employers will have to give their staff six months notice of when they expect them to retire .
they will also have to treat all workers equally when it comes to training , regardless of age phrases in adverts seeking " enthusiastic young staff " or " mature individuals " , for example , will be banned .
recruitment schemes aimed at graduates will have to be changed , while sifting job applications by age must also end .
employment tribunals from now on anyone who feels they have suffered because of their age will be able to take a case to an employment tribunal , where the penalty will be an unlimited fine .
some employers fear they will face many more tribunal cases .
a recent survey by the employers forum on ageing found that 40 % of employers in the uk think that once the new laws come in , age discrimination will be a feature of more than half of tribunal cases .
despite the attention given to older people being forced out of the workforce , the laws will apply just as much to young people .
dumping the youngest workers into the lowest paid jobs while they are allegedly " learning " could be challenged .
not all of the government 's plans are being implemented in one go .
it recently decided to postpone until the start of december the changes that will be required by pension funds .
there will now be a further period of consultation before new guidance is published and the pension element of the new laws comes into effect .
there could be some unintended consequences for other benefits offered by employers .
for instance those who offer benefits like health or life insurance up to a current retirement age of 60 may find they are now charged much more by insurance firms to cover their staff to 65 .
" all employers who offer any protection benefits for their staff will have to make sure the schemes are written to 65 or they could end up denying benefits to older workers , " says peter coussens , of financial advisers kynaston-carnoustie .

zia trench politics show london the hall was packed , a minor-celeb took that stage , the lights were dimmed .
" welcome " , michael portillo said , to this open primary .
the event was to select the next tory parliamentary candidate to get back the seat in battersea .
and boy , do the tories want it back !
the reason they stand a chance , is the labour mp only just won it last time ...
so , being a major target , selection night was a big event .
they gave the four candidates a good grilling - a really savvy audience asking questions - from state of the bus routes to relationships with america , china and iraq .
and they could handle it .
after all , none of them were " real locals " .
simply the best ...
in fact , they were all on david cameron 's priority list - a controversial initiative to make sure women , ethnic and other minorities , are candidates in winnable seats .
it is not quite fair to imply central office shipped these guys in -lrb- two women and two black candidates -rrb- because the local party did actually interview 20 applicants and told me , " they simply picked the best ones they met " .
it was not the only controversial aspect of the night .
there was also an open door policy .
in an effort to be more transparent and inclusive , the voting was open to all local residents - members and non-members alike .
i was hoping the local labour contingency was going to abuse this , but no , most people i met were paid up party members .
however , i did meet a young man outside , who told me he fought the campaign that got the labour mp in .
we were about to go in ... but seeing all the party stewards , he bottled it and disappeared back out the door .
also on the programme ...
we also talk to ian duncan-smith this week - he has been put in charge of tackling poverty .
it is another aspect to this newly branded , all-inclusive , compassionate tory party .

zia trench politics show london preaching to the party faithful ...
the hall was packed , a minor-celeb took that stage , the lights were dimmed .
" welcome " , michael portillo said , to this open primary .
the event was to select the next tory parliamentary candidate to get back the seat in battersea .
and boy , do the tories want it back !
the reason they stand a chance , is the labour mp only just won it last time ...
so , being a major target , selection night was a big event .
they gave the four candidates a good grilling - a really savvy audience asking questions - from state of the bus routes to relationships with america , china and iraq .
and they could handle it .
after all , none of them were " real locals " .
simply the best ...
a testing time on current affairs ...
in fact , they were all on david cameron 's priority list - a controversial initiative to make sure women , ethnic and other minorities , are candidates in winnable seats .
it is not quite fair to imply central office shipped these guys in -lrb- two women and two black candidates -rrb- because the local party did actually interview 20 applicants and told me , " they simply picked the best ones they met " .
it was not the only controversial aspect of the night .
there was also an open door policy .
in an effort to be more transparent and inclusive , the voting was open to all local residents - members and non-members alike .
i was hoping the local labour contingency was going to abuse this , but no , most people i met were paid up party members .
however , i did meet a young man outside , who told me he fought the campaign that got the labour mp in .
we were about to go in ... but seeing all the party stewards , he bottled it and disappeared back out the door .
also on the programme ...
a new role on poverty in the party for ids we also talk to ian duncan-smith this week - he has been put in charge of tackling poverty .
it is another aspect to this newly branded , all-inclusive , compassionate tory party .

his energetic speech persuaded the tory faithful that he was the man to lead them .
a year later , david cameron brings his party to bournemouth to ruffle the seaside nest of a retired population with talk of personality and policies .
this will be his first uk conference as leader .
over the past year he has been at the forefront of a changing party but is he at risk of alienating the core conservative vote ?
delegates at the labour and liberal democrat party conferences over the past two weeks admit cameron is wooing the electorate but they doubt that his radical ideas will be welcomed by party members .
mr cameron will address the conference twice this week .
on sunday evening , cameron will speak of the party 's past and future before heading off to meet welsh delegates at a local hotel .
his main address will be kept until the final day of conference .
conservative week sunday senator john mccain david cameron monday hot topic : marketing to children public services debate david davis , crime debate hot topic : cheap flights environment debate tuesday hot topic : alcohol and drugs social justice debate business in society george osborne , economy william hague , liam fox , foreign affairs devolution debate wednesday culture of creativity hot topic : globalisation global poverty debate leader 's speech during both speeches critics will be looking for policy-making decisions .
across the dispatch box , the prime minister tony blair accuses cameron 's shadow cabinet of being ' policy-lite ' .
yet , the tories would argue that they have proposed a number of policy initiatives - for example ; a school leavers programme , police reform and a british bill of rights .
but cameron - the cyclist - is best known for his focus on environmental issues with plans to reduce carbon emissions , incentives to encourage ownership of eco-friendly cars and more research into green technologies .
as leader he has set six key policy challenges : the economy , social justice , improving quality of life , improving public services , home security and globalisation .
policy groups are currently gathering evidence and will report from the end of this year .
according to the conservatives , they will " deliver a new kind of politics for wales " .
tories will debate devolution on tuesday welsh conservatives say they are committed to putting power back into the hands of local people .
nick bourne , conservative assembly leader , plans to outline the party 's main themes for the 2007 elections this week .
" our objective is to see a conservative political agenda delivering a successful , prosperous and vibrant wales , " he said .
on tuesday , party members will witness a rare opportunity at a tory conference - a debate on devolution .
in the first conference discussion of its kind since 1999 , shadow welsh secretary cheryl gillan will tell members how the party must make devolution work .
" we have to show - and are showing - that the conservative party is changing and is in tune with the needs of people and their communities , " she says .
confident with cameron at the helm , conservatives will no doubt talk of once again being in government both at westminster and cardiff bay .
this trip to the seaside may blast a bit of fresh air into discussions this week but when the tide of debate recedes will policies remain ?

this will be his first uk conference as leader .
over the past year he has been at the forefront of a changing party but is he at risk of alienating the core conservative vote ?
delegates at the labour and liberal democrat party conferences over the past two weeks admit cameron is wooing the electorate but they doubt that his radical ideas will be welcomed by party members .
mr cameron will address the conference twice this week .
on sunday evening , cameron will speak of the party 's past and future before heading off to meet welsh delegates at a local hotel .
his main address will be kept until the final day of conference .
conservative week sunday senator john mccain david cameron monday hot topic : marketing to children public services debate david davis , crime debate hot topic : cheap flights environment debate tuesday hot topic : alcohol and drugs social justice debate business in society george osborne , economy william hague , liam fox , foreign affairs devolution debate wednesday culture of creativity hot topic : globalisation global poverty debate leader 's speech during both speeches critics will be looking for policy-making decisions .
across the dispatch box , the prime minister tony blair accuses cameron 's shadow cabinet of being ' policy-lite ' .
yet , the tories would argue that they have proposed a number of policy initiatives - for example ; a school leavers programme , police reform and a british bill of rights .
but cameron - the cyclist - is best known for his focus on environmental issues with plans to reduce carbon emissions , incentives to encourage ownership of eco-friendly cars and more research into green technologies .
as leader he has set six key policy challenges : the economy , social justice , improving quality of life , improving public services , home security and globalisation .
policy groups are currently gathering evidence and will report from the end of this year .
according to the conservatives , they will " deliver a new kind of politics for wales " .
tories will debate devolution on tuesday welsh conservatives say they are committed to putting power back into the hands of local people .
nick bourne , conservative assembly leader , plans to outline the party 's main themes for the 2007 elections this week .
" our objective is to see a conservative political agenda delivering a successful , prosperous and vibrant wales , " he said .
on tuesday , party members will witness a rare opportunity at a tory conference - a debate on devolution .
in the first conference discussion of its kind since 1999 , shadow welsh secretary cheryl gillan will tell members how the party must make devolution work .
" we have to show - and are showing - that the conservative party is changing and is in tune with the needs of people and their communities , " she says .
confident with cameron at the helm , conservatives will no doubt talk of once again being in government both at westminster and cardiff bay .
this trip to the seaside may blast a bit of fresh air into discussions this week but when the tide of debate recedes will policies remain ?

last updated : sunday , 1 october 2006 , 08:49 gmt 09:49 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version south west : sharks ... in deep water louise hubball the politics show south west click here to view the politics show south west the porbeagle shark can be spotted off the cornwall coast , but rarely over the summer , the region saw its first cage diving trips to see sharks off the cornish coast .
more than 1,000 people applied for the chance to have a close encounter with a blue , thresher or porbeagle shark .
but as shark tourism increases with boating and diving trips , the likelihood of seeing one is growing slimmer and slimmer .
this week , members of european parliament voted on new measures to protect the rapidly dwindling shark population .
the line which chilled cinema goers in the 70s , was " just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water " .
delicacy in reality , humans have always posed a far greater risk to the sharks , than the other way round .
one of things that threaten the sharks , who visit out coasts , has its origins thousands of miles away , and is the very thing that has made them such effective predators .
sharks ' fins are considered such a delicacy in the far east , and the hunting of the sharks for these fins is threatening the species .
the british shark angling society is based in looe , and in the 50s tourists flocked there , to see sharks weighed on the quay .
they still strike fear at their very sight ...
due to a dramatic drop in numbers , these grisly trophies have now been firmly relegated to the local pub .
melvyn toms has fished sharks for over 40 years , and now hosts diving trips to see them .
all sharks that are caught are now tagged and thrown back .
numbers sink there is a small reward for the return of the tag , which gives the fishes ' vital statistics , providing a clue to their migratory paths .
" in the 70s , " says melvyn , " we were catching in the region of 2-3,000 sharks , running with a par each year , 71 , 72 and then in 73 , they declined quite dramatically to , i think it was , 1,700 .
" and since then it has been a decline .
" but i think it seems to be accelerating now .
now in 2006 , it 's down to a figure of around 150 for the year , of blue sharks caught in looe . "
one of threats is the popularity of shark fin soup .
it is believed to have special healing properties in the far east .
it can sell for up to £ 65 a bowl .
fin protection in some aquariums , divers can form ' working ' relationships with sharks previously , sharks were thrown back into the sea after having their fins hacked off , whilst they were still alive .
since 2003 this practice has been illegal , but it is believed it does still happen .
to clamp down on this , there is a fin to carcass ratio ... current eu regulations say that fins must not exceed 5 % of the total carcasses landed and bought back to shore .
troubled waters spain is the biggest supplier of shark fins in the eu , and they want the current fin ratio to be raised to 6.5 % , allowing more sharks to be caught .
but an alternative motion has been put to the european parliament in strasbourg to reduce the ratio to 2 % , to try and protect the population .
supporters , such as the shark trust , say this is in line with scientific findings .
" we require sharks for our ecosystem , explains alison hood of the shark trust , " they maintain the balance , in our ecosystem , so it would be incredibly short sighted to think they 're not critical .
" we are merely seeking appropriate management for our shark populations .
the ultimate killing animal success " if this proposed amendment goes through it would be devastating for shark populations and would put us a step further back in european shark management . "
whilst we were filming , alison received a phone call .
the european parliament has taken a vote on the issue .
" we got all three amendments , " she said , " it was a strong vote in favour of removing the ratio for sharks . "
but , due to the eu constitution , this will not be final decision .
that is due to be taken by the council of ministers in brussels at the end of october .
south west mep , neil parish , hopes they will follow the parliament 's lead .
" you see , had the uk government supporting us with our amendments , we 've got the belgians .
we 've got the germans , we 've got quite a lot of the nations who are welfare conscious and conservation conscious , really supporting us on this and it will take action .
" and the problem as always it takes too much time , we need action now . "
this summer has seen the first cage dives off the coast of cornwall , and it is ironic that shark tourism has taken off in the south west , as numbers are dwindling .
for a predator which has evolved over 450 million years , the council of ministers ' final decision could therefore be one of the most crucial challenges it has faced .
