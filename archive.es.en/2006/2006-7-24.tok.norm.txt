reports of organized crime rings targeting luxury models and high-end minivans , destined for resale at points further east , are common .

when the young whipper-snapper emerged from the florist , the car was gone - octogenarian and all .
fortunately , falk was found unharmed a few miles away .
it seems the thief simply had n't noticed the elderly gentleman in the back seat .
" he did n't notice me at all until i asked him where he was taking me , " falk said . "
he was really startled when he realized he was not alone and immediately pulled over to let me out . "

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything .

however , the eu said unspecified " subsequent steps " involving human embryonic stem cells would not be included in the ban and would be eligible for funding . " the financing ... from eu funds is possible , but subject to very tight ethical rules and procedures , " said jukka pekkarinen , head of the finance ministry 's economics department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan eight countries - germany , austria , poland , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania luxembourg and malta - were looking to block funding for all embryonic stem cell research . but with the 51 billion euros -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- 2007-2013 financial package for science funding waiting for the green light , eu ministers were forced to compromise to keep large , long-term projects operating into next year without disruption . until monday , the eight countries insisted the common eu budget should not be used for activities banned in some member states , despite the argument that such research could be crucial in finding cures for chronic diseases such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
germany led the call for a ban germany had been at the forefront of the call for a total ban before changing its stance in the final hours of the ministers ' meeting .
german research minister annette schavan sent a letter last week to the eu presidency condemning the idea of eu cash being used for stem cell research . # b # " the european union science program should not be used to give financial incentives to kill embryos , " she wrote before the meeting .
" the current proposal from the european commission and the european parliament does not rule this out . " italy , luxembourg and slovenia joined germany in dropped their objections to the funding , while poland , lithuania , malta , slovakia and austria refused to sign on to the agreement . the eu found itself in a similar disagreement over genetic-related research before it adopted its science funding package for 2000-2006 .
the outcome of that discussion produced the current system of a case-by-case approach to stem cell-based projects which needs to pass several stages of national and eu ethical committees screening .
this type of research also can not be carried out in member states where it is banned by national legislation .
but opponents of the package insist this is not enough .

when the young whipper-snapper emerged from the florist , the car was gone - octogenarian and all .
fortunately , falk was found unharmed a few miles away .
it seems the thief simply had n't noticed the elderly gentleman in the back seat .
" he did n't notice me at all until i asked him where he was taking me , " falk said . "
he was really startled when he realized he was not alone and immediately pulled over to let me out . "

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate . consumer affairs minister horst seehofer told a major german newspaper over the weekend that 2007 will be the year smoking becomes illegal in public buildings in germany . " i expect that we will have a smoking ban sometime during 2007 , " he told the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he said the ban will be put on the agenda when parliament reconvenes after its summer break . " common sense , and necessary " germany is one of a dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants .
seehofer said it was not acceptable that people can just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says further debate on pubs and restaurants is needed but whether or not the ban extends to pubs and restaurants still needs to be debated , seehofer added .
that comment elicited angry responses from political opponents and physicians . seehofer noted that restaurants have " actually said they are prepared to create more non-smoking sections . "
but , he added , " to date , i am very unhappy with the progress .
the pubs have moved much too slowly toward creating more non-smoking areas . " künast urges movement greens parliamentary party leader renate künast told news agencies that seehofer should " stop giving sound bites " on the matter and " finally do his homework . "
she called the rejuvenated debate on pubs and smoking a diversionary tactic from the fact that seehofer has not yet put into effect a promised ban on tobacco advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : künast held seehofer 's job under the previous government meanwhile , the president of the german physicians ' association responded critically to seehofer 's comments .
jörg-dietrich hoppe said that politicians should put into place a " consistent " smoking ban that would extend to restaurants and pubs . in a statement to the tagesspiegel newspaper , hoppe urged the politicians not to do " just half a job . "
he said including pubs and restaurants in the smoking ban is a must . he also sharply criticized the association of hotels and inns , which he blames for trying to skirt measures to provide non-smoking areas for patrons .
there is reportedly no proof that the association has been holding its members to an agreed-to goal of 30 percent non-smoking seats in 30 percent of pubs by march of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german smokers facing tough times protecting public health is the right thing to do , but the eu 's tobacco advertising ban is the wrong way to go about it , says dw 's karl zawadzky .
-lrb- june 20 , 2006 -rrb- minister calls for smoking ban in public buildings germany 's consumer affairs and agriculture minister horst seehofer has come out in support of a general smoking ban in restaurants and other public buildings .
he 's got support from several federal states .

however , the eu said unspecified " subsequent steps " involving human embryonic stem cells would not be included in the ban and would be eligible for funding . " the financing ... from eu funds is possible , but subject to very tight ethical rules and procedures , " said jukka pekkarinen , head of the finance ministry 's economics department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan eight countries - germany , austria , poland , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania luxembourg and malta - were looking to block funding for all embryonic stem cell research . but with the 51 billion euros -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- 2007-2013 financial package for science funding waiting for the green light , eu ministers were forced to compromise to keep large , long-term projects operating into next year without disruption . until monday , the eight countries insisted the common eu budget should not be used for activities banned in some member states , despite the argument that such research could be crucial in finding cures for chronic diseases such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
germany led the call for a ban germany had been at the forefront of the call for a total ban before changing its stance in the final hours of the ministers ' meeting .
german research minister annette schavan sent a letter last week to the eu presidency condemning the idea of eu cash being used for stem cell research . # b # " the european union science program should not be used to give financial incentives to kill embryos , " she wrote before the meeting .
" the current proposal from the european commission and the european parliament does not rule this out . " italy , luxembourg and slovenia joined germany in dropped their objections to the funding , while poland , lithuania , malta , slovakia and austria refused to sign on to the agreement . the eu found itself in a similar disagreement over genetic-related research before it adopted its science funding package for 2000-2006 .
the outcome of that discussion produced the current system of a case-by-case approach to stem cell-based projects which needs to pass several stages of national and eu ethical committees screening .
this type of research also can not be carried out in member states where it is banned by national legislation .
but opponents of the package insist this is not enough .
the controversial issue of stem cell research is a relatively minor one in terms of the total eu funding but it is viewed as a political and ideological bombshell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .

" due to the weakness of the lebanese army , israel supports the possibility of deploying a multinational force with a strong mandate , " a defense ministry official quoted amir peretz as saying , adding that the force could be sponsored by the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half a million people are homeless in lebanon , the un said israeli prime minister ehud olmert told steinmeier that israel would only accept a strong eu force with battle experience . " israel is ready to see deployment of a force with military capabilities and combat experience made up of troops from european union countries once its mandate has been fixed , " olmert said . the mandate " will have to include control of the border crossings between syria and lebanon , deployment in south lebanon and support for the lebanese army , " he added . so far , there are no concrete proposals on the table , but german officials were optimistic the the plan would move forward . " i am banking on finding a rapid solution , " steinmeier said .
" because i am convinced that the sooner we find a separate solution to the conflict in the gaza strip , the sooner we will begin to solve the problem on the northern israel-lebanon border and end the hostilities . " delicate questions there could be delicate questions , however , on whether the force 's mission is to disarm hezbollah or to support the lebanese army 's efforts to take control in the south of the country . " the discussions have not yet reached the stage where we can describe exactly what form such a security presence would take , " steinmeier said .
" it could be a strengthening of the lebanese military , it could mean taking over border control , but could be something else .
we need to draw up a list of duties first and then spread the work out between an international task-force .
i hope we can set off on the road to peace within the next few days . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is open to a multinational force but is not likely to participate us secretary of state condoleezza rice had already stated that the united states was open to the proposal .
she will discuss it on her crisis mission to the middle east and italy this week . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora said , however , that the united nations should take the lead if an international force is to be established .
siniora , who called for an immediate ceasefire , said no concrete proposals have been offered for a multinational force . a multilateral presence however , on sunday mohamad chatah , an advisor to siniora , said the issue of a multinational force is " not at the center of the problem . " " what - you send troops to finish a war that israel could n't finish , " he asked on cnn .
" and unless we have a clear solution to these problems and a political framework , a multinational force , whether nato or a un force , does n't make a whole lot of sense . " israeli media reported that the country could envisage an eu force controlling the border between lebanon and syria , similar to the successful operation between egypt and the gaza strip .
peretz told steinmeier that the release of the israeli soldiers was a pre-requisite for an end to the fighting . germany in 2004 brokered a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah .
steinmeier played a leading role in that operation , but berlin has not confirmed press reports that german intelligence agents were trying to solve the current hostage crisis . humanitarian disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said humanitarian aid ca n't get through steinmeier said that progress has been made towards persuading israel to open safe corridors in lebanon and to allow an international force to deploy in the war-torn country .

" israel is ready to see deployment of a force with military capabilities and combat experience made up of troops from european union countries once its mandate has been fixed , " olmert said . the mandate " will have to include control of the border crossings between syria and lebanon , deployment in south lebanon and support for the lebanese army , " he added . so far , there are no concrete proposals on the table , but german officials were optimistic the the plan would move forward . " i am banking on finding a rapid solution , " steinmeier said .
" because i am convinced that the sooner we find a separate solution to the conflict in the gaza strip , the sooner we will begin to solve the problem on the northern israel-lebanon border and end the hostilities . " delicate questions there could be delicate questions , however , on whether the force 's mission is to disarm hezbollah or to support the lebanese army 's efforts to take control in the south of the country . " the discussions have not yet reached the stage where we can describe exactly what form such a security presence would take , " steinmeier said .
" it could be a strengthening of the lebanese military , it could mean taking over border control , but could be something else .
we need to draw up a list of duties first and then spread the work out between an international task-force .
i hope we can set off on the road to peace within the next few days . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is open to a multinational force but is not likely to participate us secretary of state condoleezza rice had already stated that the united states was open to the proposal .
she will discuss it on her crisis mission to the middle east and italy this week . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora said , however , that the united nations should take the lead if an international force is to be established .
siniora , who called for an immediate ceasefire , said no concrete proposals have been offered for a multinational force . a multilateral presence however , on sunday mohamad chatah , an advisor to siniora , said the issue of a multinational force is " not at the center of the problem . " " what - you send troops to finish a war that israel could n't finish , " he asked on cnn .
" and unless we have a clear solution to these problems and a political framework , a multinational force , whether nato or a un force , does n't make a whole lot of sense . " israeli media reported that the country could envisage an eu force controlling the border between lebanon and syria , similar to the successful operation between egypt and the gaza strip .
peretz told steinmeier that the release of the israeli soldiers was a pre-requisite for an end to the fighting . germany in 2004 brokered a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah .
steinmeier played a leading role in that operation , but berlin has not confirmed press reports that german intelligence agents were trying to solve the current hostage crisis . humanitarian disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said humanitarian aid ca n't get through steinmeier said that progress has been made towards persuading israel to open safe corridors in lebanon and to allow an international force to deploy in the war-torn country . " i am satisfied that we could reach certain agreements on opening up humanitarian corridors , which will be implemented , " he told german public broadcaster zdf . dw staff with wire services -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fears of escalation rise as syria issues warning to israel israeli jets blitzed lebanon sunday and hezbollah fired off more deadly rockets in a new bout of tit-for-tat attacks as the conflict continued to spiral despite international efforts for a ceasefire .

" due to the weakness of the lebanese army , israel supports the possibility of deploying a multinational force with a strong mandate , " a defense ministry official quoted amir peretz as saying , adding that the force could be sponsored by the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half a million people are homeless in lebanon , the un said israeli prime minister ehud olmert told steinmeier that israel would only accept a strong eu force with battle experience . " israel is ready to see deployment of a force with military capabilities and combat experience made up of troops from european union countries once its mandate has been fixed , " olmert said . the mandate " will have to include control of the border crossings between syria and lebanon , deployment in south lebanon and support for the lebanese army , " he added . so far , there are no concrete proposals on the table , but german officials were optimistic the the plan would move forward . " i am banking on finding a rapid solution , " steinmeier said .
" because i am convinced that the sooner we find a separate solution to the conflict in the gaza strip , the sooner we will begin to solve the problem on the northern israel-lebanon border and end the hostilities . " delicate questions there could be delicate questions , however , on whether the force 's mission is to disarm hezbollah or to support the lebanese army 's efforts to take control in the south of the country . " the discussions have not yet reached the stage where we can describe exactly what form such a security presence would take , " steinmeier said .
" it could be a strengthening of the lebanese military , it could mean taking over border control , but could be something else .
we need to draw up a list of duties first and then spread the work out between an international task-force .
i hope we can set off on the road to peace within the next few days . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is open to a multinational force but is not likely to participate us secretary of state condoleezza rice had already stated that the united states was open to the proposal .
she will discuss it on her crisis mission to the middle east and italy this week . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora said , however , that the united nations should take the lead if an international force is to be established .
siniora , who called for an immediate ceasefire , said no concrete proposals have been offered for a multinational force . a multilateral presence however , on sunday mohamad chatah , an advisor to siniora , said the issue of a multinational force is " not at the center of the problem . " " what - you send troops to finish a war that israel could n't finish , " he asked on cnn .
" and unless we have a clear solution to these problems and a political framework , a multinational force , whether nato or a un force , does n't make a whole lot of sense . " israeli media reported that the country could envisage an eu force controlling the border between lebanon and syria , similar to the successful operation between egypt and the gaza strip .
peretz told steinmeier that the release of the israeli soldiers was a pre-requisite for an end to the fighting . germany in 2004 brokered a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah .
steinmeier played a leading role in that operation , but berlin has not confirmed press reports that german intelligence agents were trying to solve the current hostage crisis . humanitarian disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said humanitarian aid ca n't get through steinmeier said that progress has been made towards persuading israel to open safe corridors in lebanon and to allow an international force to deploy in the war-torn country .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great . " mr. röttgens ' decision not to take the job is a warning to all association officers who are also in the german bundestag , " said dirk niebel , the general secretary of the opposition fdp party . pressure on göhner while two members of the opposition left party and one spd parliamentarian also work full-time at the federation of german trade unions , the debate over lobbyists in parliament is now increasingly focused on göhner .
in recent interviews , three bundestag vice-presidents , including social democrat susanne kastner , urged the cdu politician to decide on one of his two positions . " what goes for röttgen must also apply to göhner and co . , " the head of the green party , reinhard bütikofer , told the bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine called for a unified fight but göhner told the berliner zeitung that he can see no conflict of interest , and that none have come up in the past 10 years . " in the future i will carry out my parliamentary mandate carefully and independently , " he told the newspaper .
" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great . " mr. röttgens ' decision not to take the job is a warning to all association officers who are also in the german bundestag , " said dirk niebel , the general secretary of the opposition fdp party . pressure on göhner while two members of the opposition left party and one spd parliamentarian also work full-time at the federation of german trade unions , the debate over lobbyists in parliament is now increasingly focused on göhner .
in recent interviews , three bundestag vice-presidents , including social democrat susanne kastner , urged the cdu politician to decide on one of his two positions . " what goes for röttgen must also apply to göhner and co . , " the head of the green party , reinhard bütikofer , told the bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine called for a unified fight but göhner told the berliner zeitung that he can see no conflict of interest , and that none have come up in the past 10 years . " in the future i will carry out my parliamentary mandate carefully and independently , " he told the newspaper .
" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything . " in a country governed by law , not only i but every individual is innocent until proven guilty , " ullrich said in a statement posted on his web site . former champion sacked by fax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich called the manner of his dismissal " unacceptable " t-mobile sacked ullrich and sevilla when both riders failed to respond to an ultimatum : prove you are not linked to the ongoing doping affair .
ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .
dismissal was the logical outcome . " no positive test or proof of innocence " for us it 's not a witch-hunt .
jan will always be the first ever german to win the tour de france , but at the same time we are not saying that he was doped .
however we have no proof of his innocence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping investigation continues " we made this decision because we believe , looking at the information provided by investigators , that jan ullrich is implicated in the spanish doping affair , " t-mobile spokesman christian frommert added .
" however ullrich has not returned a positive doping test . " despite rumors of a meeting between the former olympic champion and t-mobile officials in a bid for reconciliation , ullrich 's future in cycling remains in doubt . a career of awards and controversy his suspension from cycling will last as long as the investigation into his alleged involvement in the doping scandal .
if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .
any positive outcome in this latest doping scandal will over-shadow his entire career . if ullrich is to retire in ignominious circumstances , it will be a sadly fitting career end for a rider who would be remembered as the german cyclist of the century who could have achieved even more than he did . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cyclist jan ullrich sacked amid doping allegations former tour de france champion jan ullrich , excluded from this year 's race because of allegations of blood-doping , has been sacked by his t-mobile team .

i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything . " in a country governed by law , not only i but every individual is innocent until proven guilty , " ullrich said in a statement posted on his web site . former champion sacked by fax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich called the manner of his dismissal " unacceptable " t-mobile sacked ullrich and sevilla when both riders failed to respond to an ultimatum : prove you are not linked to the ongoing doping affair .
ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .
dismissal was the logical outcome . " no positive test or proof of innocence " for us it 's not a witch-hunt .
jan will always be the first ever german to win the tour de france , but at the same time we are not saying that he was doped .
however we have no proof of his innocence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping investigation continues " we made this decision because we believe , looking at the information provided by investigators , that jan ullrich is implicated in the spanish doping affair , " t-mobile spokesman christian frommert added .
" however ullrich has not returned a positive doping test . " despite rumors of a meeting between the former olympic champion and t-mobile officials in a bid for reconciliation , ullrich 's future in cycling remains in doubt . a career of awards and controversy his suspension from cycling will last as long as the investigation into his alleged involvement in the doping scandal .
if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .
any positive outcome in this latest doping scandal will over-shadow his entire career . if ullrich is to retire in ignominious circumstances , it will be a sadly fitting career end for a rider who would be remembered as the german cyclist of the century who could have achieved even more than he did . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cyclist jan ullrich sacked amid doping allegations former tour de france champion jan ullrich , excluded from this year 's race because of allegations of blood-doping , has been sacked by his t-mobile team .

germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .
" and we are in close contact with ngos on the ground to coordinate our relief efforts . " while this would be a start , with growing calls for an international force to be put in place within the next week , germany may find itself making a tough decision on deployment in the coming days . bundestag divisions over deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un already has observers in lebanon discussions on a deployment in the bundestag have so far been heated .
gregor gysi , the floor leader of the opposition left party in the national parliament , categorically rejected the idea of any german troops participating in a middle east stabilization force .
he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .
but several mps from the ruling christian and social democrats have indicated that they 'd have fewer qualms about making german soldiers part of such a mission as long as israel itself gave its backing for such a move . diplomats , spies brokering deal meanwhile , the german focus remains on ceasefire before any troops go in .
gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop . " we have so-called ' sounding out ' teams consisting of regional specialists holding discussions in damascus and beirut , and also with the united nations at the moment , " erler said .
" there seems to be movement , a possibility , in the area of prisoner exchange .
there is now interesting news from hezbollah that they would be prepared to begin negotiations .
the ' sounding out ' teams are attempting to pave the way for this . " a ceasefire brought about by a mutual prisoner exchange would allow the multinational force to enter lebanon to keep the peace , not stop the war .
this in turn would decrease the distasteful possibility of german troops being called upon to fight in the middle east .
however , the weight of history will be felt on any decision to deploy the bundeswehr on israel 's borders . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomatic initiatives moving forward in middle east after days of diplomatic efforts , the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to the middle east looks increasingly likely .

" we risk weakening the wto and the multilateral trading system at a time when we urgently need to top up international confidence , not further damage it , " mandelson said after the collapse of a meeting of six influential wto nations . " as well as an economic cost , there is a huge political cost of failure , " he told journalists . in a report last week , the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said progress at the wto was " urgently needed " to " reinforce " crucial agricultural reform in some rich countries " and re-start it in others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said the wto missed a big chance for fair trade german agriculture minister horst seehofer said he was disappointed with the meeting 's result . " a historic chance to create fair rules for the trade of agricultural and industrial goods was missed , " he said from berlin .
the eu delegation at the talks was responsible for representing germany and the bloc 's other member states . last year , under its then british presidency , the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- also pinpointed a wto deal as a key plank in global efforts to eradicate poverty in the developing nations on top of massive aid package . " you can give them four more months , give them four more years , give them four more centuries , but unless the eu and the us make fundamental changes to their offers then these talks will fail development , " said celine charveriat of the international development charity oxfam .
" the potential for world trade to help poorer countries to develop will be lost . " washington blamed for failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade minister kamal nath indian trade minister kamal nath blamed the united states for the collapse of the talks , saying washington had not matched flexibility shown by the eu and other wto nations on farm trade . " i do n't want to get into the blame game , " he said .
" but it 's very clear that the eu made a movement .
everyone put something on the table except for one country , who said : ' we ca n't see anything on the table . ' " the round is not dead .
but it 's definitely between intensive care and the crematorium , " nath added .
" this failure is a significant failure .
the failure is inherently because of the gap in mind-sets .
unless we are able to bridge this gap , there is no future for this round . " the troubled effort to bring down agricultural and industrial barriers was dubbed the doha development agenda when it was launched in the qatari capital in 2001 . history shows perseverance works it was proclaimed as a way to stimulate developing nations by allowing them to sell their produce more freely in wealthy countries and to stop rich nation subsidies distorting world prices . subsidy and tariff cuts in farming are a left over from previous failure to resolve the issues under the wto 's predecessor , the general agreement on tariffs and trade -lrb- gatt -rrb- , and the deal that led to the creation of the wto in 1995 . " even though today truly represents a failure , this is not the time to pull offers off the table , to talk about take it or leave it , " us secretary for agriculture mike johanns said in geneva .
" if you look at the history of the uruguay round , it stopped and started a number of times . " after missing the original deadline to complete the doha round by 2005 , the international community had been counting on securing the outlines of deal this summer in order to complete it by the end of the 2006 . expiring us power to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush with mike johanns in july 2007 , us president george w. bush will lose his special " fast-track " trading authority , which allows the white house to make deals that can be either approved or rejected by congress , but not amended . even though the eu and india were blaming washington 's allegedly inflexible stance on agriculture for the failure of monday 's meeting , the expiration of fast-track will make any global trade deal even harder to achieve in the future . the us congress , and the domestic us farming lobby , would have even greater leverage on washington 's stance on cuts to domestic support , or concessions from other countries , than they have now . " the timeout has been called in the talks .
that does not mean that it is not possible to pick up in the future , " eu agriculture commissioner marianne fischer boel said .
" it is a big failure .
if it 's going to be definite , only time will tell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2006 germans face dilemma as israel warms to un peace force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is slowly accepting the idea of a un force made up of eu troops - including germans talk of a multinational peace-keeping force for lebanon is causing germany a political headache as it debates sending troops to israel 's borders .
germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .
" and we are in close contact with ngos on the ground to coordinate our relief efforts . " while this would be a start , with growing calls for an international force to be put in place within the next week , germany may find itself making a tough decision on deployment in the coming days . bundestag divisions over deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un already has observers in lebanon discussions on a deployment in the bundestag have so far been heated .
gregor gysi , the floor leader of the opposition left party in the national parliament , categorically rejected the idea of any german troops participating in a middle east stabilization force .
he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .
but several mps from the ruling christian and social democrats have indicated that they 'd have fewer qualms about making german soldiers part of such a mission as long as israel itself gave its backing for such a move . diplomats , spies brokering deal meanwhile , the german focus remains on ceasefire before any troops go in .
gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop . " we have so-called ' sounding out ' teams consisting of regional specialists holding discussions in damascus and beirut , and also with the united nations at the moment , " erler said .
" there seems to be movement , a possibility , in the area of prisoner exchange .
there is now interesting news from hezbollah that they would be prepared to begin negotiations .
the ' sounding out ' teams are attempting to pave the way for this . " a ceasefire brought about by a mutual prisoner exchange would allow the multinational force to enter lebanon to keep the peace , not stop the war .
this in turn would decrease the distasteful possibility of german troops being called upon to fight in the middle east .

germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .
" and we are in close contact with ngos on the ground to coordinate our relief efforts . " while this would be a start , with growing calls for an international force to be put in place within the next week , germany may find itself making a tough decision on deployment in the coming days . bundestag divisions over deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un already has observers in lebanon discussions on a deployment in the bundestag have so far been heated .
gregor gysi , the floor leader of the opposition left party in the national parliament , categorically rejected the idea of any german troops participating in a middle east stabilization force .
he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .
but several mps from the ruling christian and social democrats have indicated that they 'd have fewer qualms about making german soldiers part of such a mission as long as israel itself gave its backing for such a move . diplomats , spies brokering deal meanwhile , the german focus remains on ceasefire before any troops go in .
gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop . " we have so-called ' sounding out ' teams consisting of regional specialists holding discussions in damascus and beirut , and also with the united nations at the moment , " erler said .
" there seems to be movement , a possibility , in the area of prisoner exchange .
there is now interesting news from hezbollah that they would be prepared to begin negotiations .
the ' sounding out ' teams are attempting to pave the way for this . " a ceasefire brought about by a mutual prisoner exchange would allow the multinational force to enter lebanon to keep the peace , not stop the war .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything . " in a country governed by law , not only i but every individual is innocent until proven guilty , " ullrich said in a statement posted on his web site . former champion sacked by fax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich called the manner of his dismissal " unacceptable " t-mobile sacked ullrich and sevilla when both riders failed to respond to an ultimatum : prove you are not linked to the ongoing doping affair .
ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .
dismissal was the logical outcome . " no positive test or proof of innocence " for us it 's not a witch-hunt .
jan will always be the first ever german to win the tour de france , but at the same time we are not saying that he was doped .
however we have no proof of his innocence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping investigation continues " we made this decision because we believe , looking at the information provided by investigators , that jan ullrich is implicated in the spanish doping affair , " t-mobile spokesman christian frommert added .
" however ullrich has not returned a positive doping test . " despite rumors of a meeting between the former olympic champion and t-mobile officials in a bid for reconciliation , ullrich 's future in cycling remains in doubt . a career of awards and controversy his suspension from cycling will last as long as the investigation into his alleged involvement in the doping scandal .
if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .
any positive outcome in this latest doping scandal will over-shadow his entire career . if ullrich is to retire in ignominious circumstances , it will be a sadly fitting career end for a rider who would be remembered as the german cyclist of the century who could have achieved even more than he did . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cyclist jan ullrich sacked amid doping allegations former tour de france champion jan ullrich , excluded from this year 's race because of allegations of blood-doping , has been sacked by his t-mobile team .

it is the second such corruption scandal to rock europe 's largest carmaker in the past year . two managers and a former employee of europe 's biggest car manufacturer , volkswagen , are under investigation by a frankfurt prosecutor over alleged kickbacks from a french supplier , company officials said sunday . officials are investigating whether a manager from the audi unit and another at volkswagen - along with a former volkswagen executive - accepted bribes worth hundreds of thousands of euros from french car parts supplier faurecia sa , according to company spokesman hartwig von sass .
he added that the company is cooperating with prosecutors in their probe . " as the company affected by this , we are supporting the investigation of the prosecutors and the federal criminal office , " von sass told the associated press . he declined to provide further details . a search of the employees ' apartments uncovered 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 88,600 -rrb- in cash hidden in a utility room , german magazine der spiegel reported . previous scandal shook company the probe follows an investigation last year into managers that had created fake companies to defraud authorities and enrich themselves while spending company money on personal travel , jewels , alcohol and sex . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw officials say they are cooperating with prosecutors then , vw asked prosecutors to investigate personnel executive klaus-joachim gebauer , fired last june , and former skoda chief helmuth schuster , who allegedly created shell companies in countries such as india , angola and the czech republic to defraud local authorities seeking business with volkswagen . prosecutors are also investigating whether company managers and members of its worker 's council received illegal privileges including lavish foreign trips paid for by the company .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate . consumer affairs minister horst seehofer told a major german newspaper over the weekend that 2007 will be the year smoking becomes illegal in public buildings in germany . " i expect that we will have a smoking ban sometime during 2007 , " he told the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he said the ban will be put on the agenda when parliament reconvenes after its summer break . " common sense , and necessary " germany is one of a dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants .
seehofer said it was not acceptable that people can just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says further debate on pubs and restaurants is needed but whether or not the ban extends to pubs and restaurants still needs to be debated , seehofer added .
that comment elicited angry responses from political opponents and physicians . seehofer noted that restaurants have " actually said they are prepared to create more non-smoking sections . "
but , he added , " to date , i am very unhappy with the progress .
the pubs have moved much too slowly toward creating more non-smoking areas . " künast urges movement greens parliamentary party leader renate künast told news agencies that seehofer should " stop giving sound bites " on the matter and " finally do his homework . "
she called the rejuvenated debate on pubs and smoking a diversionary tactic from the fact that seehofer has not yet put into effect a promised ban on tobacco advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : künast held seehofer 's job under the previous government meanwhile , the president of the german physicians ' association responded critically to seehofer 's comments .
jörg-dietrich hoppe said that politicians should put into place a " consistent " smoking ban that would extend to restaurants and pubs . in a statement to the tagesspiegel newspaper , hoppe urged the politicians not to do " just half a job . "
he said including pubs and restaurants in the smoking ban is a must . he also sharply criticized the association of hotels and inns , which he blames for trying to skirt measures to provide non-smoking areas for patrons .
there is reportedly no proof that the association has been holding its members to an agreed-to goal of 30 percent non-smoking seats in 30 percent of pubs by march of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german smokers facing tough times protecting public health is the right thing to do , but the eu 's tobacco advertising ban is the wrong way to go about it , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.07.2006 eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research . european union ministers went some way to appeasing eight of the bloc 's members , including germany , who had called for a complete ban of stem cell research funding when it was announced that the money would allow limited use of eu cash for research involving human embryonic stem cells . the agreement bans research that involves destroying human embryos , including for the procurement of stem cells .
however , the eu said unspecified " subsequent steps " involving human embryonic stem cells would not be included in the ban and would be eligible for funding . " the financing ... from eu funds is possible , but subject to very tight ethical rules and procedures , " said jukka pekkarinen , head of the finance ministry 's economics department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan eight countries - germany , austria , poland , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania luxembourg and malta - were looking to block funding for all embryonic stem cell research . but with the 51 billion euros -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- 2007-2013 financial package for science funding waiting for the green light , eu ministers were forced to compromise to keep large , long-term projects operating into next year without disruption . until monday , the eight countries insisted the common eu budget should not be used for activities banned in some member states , despite the argument that such research could be crucial in finding cures for chronic diseases such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
germany led the call for a ban germany had been at the forefront of the call for a total ban before changing its stance in the final hours of the ministers ' meeting .
german research minister annette schavan sent a letter last week to the eu presidency condemning the idea of eu cash being used for stem cell research . # b # " the european union science program should not be used to give financial incentives to kill embryos , " she wrote before the meeting .
" the current proposal from the european commission and the european parliament does not rule this out . " italy , luxembourg and slovenia joined germany in dropped their objections to the funding , while poland , lithuania , malta , slovakia and austria refused to sign on to the agreement . the eu found itself in a similar disagreement over genetic-related research before it adopted its science funding package for 2000-2006 .
the outcome of that discussion produced the current system of a case-by-case approach to stem cell-based projects which needs to pass several stages of national and eu ethical committees screening .
this type of research also can not be carried out in member states where it is banned by national legislation .
but opponents of the package insist this is not enough .
the controversial issue of stem cell research is a relatively minor one in terms of the total eu funding but it is viewed as a political and ideological bombshell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quarters were apparently too close to defend the car with a cane a german in poland lost at least one of his most prized possessions when a thief made off with his bmw 5 series - with his grandfather in back of the car . whether deserved or not , poland has the reputation of being a major european auto-theft capital .
reports of organized crime rings targeting luxury models and high-end minivans , destined for resale at points further east , are common .
so 34-year-old german bernhard massl should have known enough not to take any chances when he parked his brand new bmw 5 series outside a florist shop in the polish town of zgorzelec .
positive he would n't even be out of the car long enough for the engine to cool , he left his 80-year-old grandpa , falk , waiting in the backseat while he popped into the store to pick up a bunch of flowers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmws and other luxury cars are sought after by auto thieves but if massl figured the old man , who no doubt told his grandson to keep the doors locked and to be careful of strangers , would act as a living and breathing anti-theft device , he figured wrong .
when the young whipper-snapper emerged from the florist , the car was gone - octogenarian and all .
fortunately , falk was found unharmed a few miles away .
it seems the thief simply had n't noticed the elderly gentleman in the back seat .
" he did n't notice me at all until i asked him where he was taking me , " falk said . "
he was really startled when he realized he was not alone and immediately pulled over to let me out . "
police are still looking for the stolen car and have put out a description of the thief . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de internet fraud costs europe millions although internet fraud is costing consumer millions in europe , europeans still remain less guarded and informed about online theft than people elsewhere .

germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .
" and we are in close contact with ngos on the ground to coordinate our relief efforts . " while this would be a start , with growing calls for an international force to be put in place within the next week , germany may find itself making a tough decision on deployment in the coming days . bundestag divisions over deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un already has observers in lebanon discussions on a deployment in the bundestag have so far been heated .
gregor gysi , the floor leader of the opposition left party in the national parliament , categorically rejected the idea of any german troops participating in a middle east stabilization force .
he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .
but several mps from the ruling christian and social democrats have indicated that they 'd have fewer qualms about making german soldiers part of such a mission as long as israel itself gave its backing for such a move . diplomats , spies brokering deal meanwhile , the german focus remains on ceasefire before any troops go in .
gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop . " we have so-called ' sounding out ' teams consisting of regional specialists holding discussions in damascus and beirut , and also with the united nations at the moment , " erler said .
" there seems to be movement , a possibility , in the area of prisoner exchange .
there is now interesting news from hezbollah that they would be prepared to begin negotiations .

germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything . " in a country governed by law , not only i but every individual is innocent until proven guilty , " ullrich said in a statement posted on his web site . former champion sacked by fax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich called the manner of his dismissal " unacceptable " t-mobile sacked ullrich and sevilla when both riders failed to respond to an ultimatum : prove you are not linked to the ongoing doping affair .
ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .
dismissal was the logical outcome . " no positive test or proof of innocence " for us it 's not a witch-hunt .
jan will always be the first ever german to win the tour de france , but at the same time we are not saying that he was doped .
however we have no proof of his innocence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping investigation continues " we made this decision because we believe , looking at the information provided by investigators , that jan ullrich is implicated in the spanish doping affair , " t-mobile spokesman christian frommert added .
" however ullrich has not returned a positive doping test . " despite rumors of a meeting between the former olympic champion and t-mobile officials in a bid for reconciliation , ullrich 's future in cycling remains in doubt . a career of awards and controversy his suspension from cycling will last as long as the investigation into his alleged involvement in the doping scandal .
if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .
any positive outcome in this latest doping scandal will over-shadow his entire career . if ullrich is to retire in ignominious circumstances , it will be a sadly fitting career end for a rider who would be remembered as the german cyclist of the century who could have achieved even more than he did . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cyclist jan ullrich sacked amid doping allegations former tour de france champion jan ullrich , excluded from this year 's race because of allegations of blood-doping , has been sacked by his t-mobile team .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything . " in a country governed by law , not only i but every individual is innocent until proven guilty , " ullrich said in a statement posted on his web site . former champion sacked by fax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich called the manner of his dismissal " unacceptable " t-mobile sacked ullrich and sevilla when both riders failed to respond to an ultimatum : prove you are not linked to the ongoing doping affair .
ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .
dismissal was the logical outcome . " no positive test or proof of innocence " for us it 's not a witch-hunt .
jan will always be the first ever german to win the tour de france , but at the same time we are not saying that he was doped .
however we have no proof of his innocence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping investigation continues " we made this decision because we believe , looking at the information provided by investigators , that jan ullrich is implicated in the spanish doping affair , " t-mobile spokesman christian frommert added .
" however ullrich has not returned a positive doping test . " despite rumors of a meeting between the former olympic champion and t-mobile officials in a bid for reconciliation , ullrich 's future in cycling remains in doubt . a career of awards and controversy his suspension from cycling will last as long as the investigation into his alleged involvement in the doping scandal .
if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .
any positive outcome in this latest doping scandal will over-shadow his entire career . if ullrich is to retire in ignominious circumstances , it will be a sadly fitting career end for a rider who would be remembered as the german cyclist of the century who could have achieved even more than he did . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cyclist jan ullrich sacked amid doping allegations former tour de france champion jan ullrich , excluded from this year 's race because of allegations of blood-doping , has been sacked by his t-mobile team .

" due to the weakness of the lebanese army , israel supports the possibility of deploying a multinational force with a strong mandate , " a defense ministry official quoted amir peretz as saying , adding that the force could be sponsored by the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half a million people are homeless in lebanon , the un said israeli prime minister ehud olmert told steinmeier that israel would only accept a strong eu force with battle experience . " israel is ready to see deployment of a force with military capabilities and combat experience made up of troops from european union countries once its mandate has been fixed , " olmert said . the mandate " will have to include control of the border crossings between syria and lebanon , deployment in south lebanon and support for the lebanese army , " he added . so far , there are no concrete proposals on the table , but german officials were optimistic the the plan would move forward .

" the discussions have not yet reached the stage where we can describe exactly what form such a security presence would take , " steinmeier said .
" it could be a strengthening of the lebanese military , it could mean taking over border control , but could be something else .

siniora , who called for an immediate ceasefire , said no concrete proposals have been offered for a multinational force . a multilateral presence however , on sunday mohamad chatah , an advisor to siniora , said the issue of a multinational force is " not at the center of the problem . " " what - you send troops to finish a war that israel could n't finish , " he asked on cnn .
" and unless we have a clear solution to these problems and a political framework , a multinational force , whether nato or a un force , does n't make a whole lot of sense . " israeli media reported that the country could envisage an eu force controlling the border between lebanon and syria , similar to the successful operation between egypt and the gaza strip .
peretz told steinmeier that the release of the israeli soldiers was a pre-requisite for an end to the fighting . germany in 2004 brokered a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah .
steinmeier played a leading role in that operation , but berlin has not confirmed press reports that german intelligence agents were trying to solve the current hostage crisis . humanitarian disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said humanitarian aid ca n't get through steinmeier said that progress has been made towards persuading israel to open safe corridors in lebanon and to allow an international force to deploy in the war-torn country .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate . consumer affairs minister horst seehofer told a major german newspaper over the weekend that 2007 will be the year smoking becomes illegal in public buildings in germany . " i expect that we will have a smoking ban sometime during 2007 , " he told the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he said the ban will be put on the agenda when parliament reconvenes after its summer break . " common sense , and necessary " germany is one of a dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants .
seehofer said it was not acceptable that people can just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says further debate on pubs and restaurants is needed but whether or not the ban extends to pubs and restaurants still needs to be debated , seehofer added .
that comment elicited angry responses from political opponents and physicians . seehofer noted that restaurants have " actually said they are prepared to create more non-smoking sections . "
but , he added , " to date , i am very unhappy with the progress .
the pubs have moved much too slowly toward creating more non-smoking areas . " künast urges movement greens parliamentary party leader renate künast told news agencies that seehofer should " stop giving sound bites " on the matter and " finally do his homework . "
she called the rejuvenated debate on pubs and smoking a diversionary tactic from the fact that seehofer has not yet put into effect a promised ban on tobacco advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : künast held seehofer 's job under the previous government meanwhile , the president of the german physicians ' association responded critically to seehofer 's comments .
jörg-dietrich hoppe said that politicians should put into place a " consistent " smoking ban that would extend to restaurants and pubs . in a statement to the tagesspiegel newspaper , hoppe urged the politicians not to do " just half a job . "
he said including pubs and restaurants in the smoking ban is a must . he also sharply criticized the association of hotels and inns , which he blames for trying to skirt measures to provide non-smoking areas for patrons .
there is reportedly no proof that the association has been holding its members to an agreed-to goal of 30 percent non-smoking seats in 30 percent of pubs by march of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german smokers facing tough times protecting public health is the right thing to do , but the eu 's tobacco advertising ban is the wrong way to go about it , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

he 's got support from several federal states .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great .

" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great . " mr. röttgens ' decision not to take the job is a warning to all association officers who are also in the german bundestag , " said dirk niebel , the general secretary of the opposition fdp party . pressure on göhner while two members of the opposition left party and one spd parliamentarian also work full-time at the federation of german trade unions , the debate over lobbyists in parliament is now increasingly focused on göhner .
in recent interviews , three bundestag vice-presidents , including social democrat susanne kastner , urged the cdu politician to decide on one of his two positions . " what goes for röttgen must also apply to göhner and co . , " the head of the green party , reinhard bütikofer , told the bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine called for a unified fight but göhner told the berliner zeitung that he can see no conflict of interest , and that none have come up in the past 10 years . " in the future i will carry out my parliamentary mandate carefully and independently , " he told the newspaper .
" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate . consumer affairs minister horst seehofer told a major german newspaper over the weekend that 2007 will be the year smoking becomes illegal in public buildings in germany . " i expect that we will have a smoking ban sometime during 2007 , " he told the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he said the ban will be put on the agenda when parliament reconvenes after its summer break . " common sense , and necessary " germany is one of a dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants .
seehofer said it was not acceptable that people can just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says further debate on pubs and restaurants is needed but whether or not the ban extends to pubs and restaurants still needs to be debated , seehofer added .
that comment elicited angry responses from political opponents and physicians . seehofer noted that restaurants have " actually said they are prepared to create more non-smoking sections . "
but , he added , " to date , i am very unhappy with the progress .
the pubs have moved much too slowly toward creating more non-smoking areas . " künast urges movement greens parliamentary party leader renate künast told news agencies that seehofer should " stop giving sound bites " on the matter and " finally do his homework . "
she called the rejuvenated debate on pubs and smoking a diversionary tactic from the fact that seehofer has not yet put into effect a promised ban on tobacco advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : künast held seehofer 's job under the previous government meanwhile , the president of the german physicians ' association responded critically to seehofer 's comments .
jörg-dietrich hoppe said that politicians should put into place a " consistent " smoking ban that would extend to restaurants and pubs . in a statement to the tagesspiegel newspaper , hoppe urged the politicians not to do " just half a job . "
he said including pubs and restaurants in the smoking ban is a must . he also sharply criticized the association of hotels and inns , which he blames for trying to skirt measures to provide non-smoking areas for patrons .
there is reportedly no proof that the association has been holding its members to an agreed-to goal of 30 percent non-smoking seats in 30 percent of pubs by march of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german smokers facing tough times protecting public health is the right thing to do , but the eu 's tobacco advertising ban is the wrong way to go about it , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

" we risk weakening the wto and the multilateral trading system at a time when we urgently need to top up international confidence , not further damage it , " mandelson said after the collapse of a meeting of six influential wto nations . " as well as an economic cost , there is a huge political cost of failure , " he told journalists . in a report last week , the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said progress at the wto was " urgently needed " to " reinforce " crucial agricultural reform in some rich countries " and re-start it in others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said the wto missed a big chance for fair trade german agriculture minister horst seehofer said he was disappointed with the meeting 's result . " a historic chance to create fair rules for the trade of agricultural and industrial goods was missed , " he said from berlin .
the eu delegation at the talks was responsible for representing germany and the bloc 's other member states . last year , under its then british presidency , the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- also pinpointed a wto deal as a key plank in global efforts to eradicate poverty in the developing nations on top of massive aid package . " you can give them four more months , give them four more years , give them four more centuries , but unless the eu and the us make fundamental changes to their offers then these talks will fail development , " said celine charveriat of the international development charity oxfam .
" the potential for world trade to help poorer countries to develop will be lost . " washington blamed for failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade minister kamal nath indian trade minister kamal nath blamed the united states for the collapse of the talks , saying washington had not matched flexibility shown by the eu and other wto nations on farm trade . " i do n't want to get into the blame game , " he said .
" but it 's very clear that the eu made a movement .
everyone put something on the table except for one country , who said : ' we ca n't see anything on the table . ' " the round is not dead .
but it 's definitely between intensive care and the crematorium , " nath added .
" this failure is a significant failure .
the failure is inherently because of the gap in mind-sets .
unless we are able to bridge this gap , there is no future for this round . " the troubled effort to bring down agricultural and industrial barriers was dubbed the doha development agenda when it was launched in the qatari capital in 2001 . history shows perseverance works it was proclaimed as a way to stimulate developing nations by allowing them to sell their produce more freely in wealthy countries and to stop rich nation subsidies distorting world prices . subsidy and tariff cuts in farming are a left over from previous failure to resolve the issues under the wto 's predecessor , the general agreement on tariffs and trade -lrb- gatt -rrb- , and the deal that led to the creation of the wto in 1995 . " even though today truly represents a failure , this is not the time to pull offers off the table , to talk about take it or leave it , " us secretary for agriculture mike johanns said in geneva .
" if you look at the history of the uruguay round , it stopped and started a number of times . " after missing the original deadline to complete the doha round by 2005 , the international community had been counting on securing the outlines of deal this summer in order to complete it by the end of the 2006 . expiring us power to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush with mike johanns in july 2007 , us president george w. bush will lose his special " fast-track " trading authority , which allows the white house to make deals that can be either approved or rejected by congress , but not amended . even though the eu and india were blaming washington 's allegedly inflexible stance on agriculture for the failure of monday 's meeting , the expiration of fast-track will make any global trade deal even harder to achieve in the future . the us congress , and the domestic us farming lobby , would have even greater leverage on washington 's stance on cuts to domestic support , or concessions from other countries , than they have now . " the timeout has been called in the talks .
that does not mean that it is not possible to pick up in the future , " eu agriculture commissioner marianne fischer boel said .
" it is a big failure .
if it 's going to be definite , only time will tell .
but at this stage it 's difficult to see if there 's a magic wand .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great . " mr. röttgens ' decision not to take the job is a warning to all association officers who are also in the german bundestag , " said dirk niebel , the general secretary of the opposition fdp party . pressure on göhner while two members of the opposition left party and one spd parliamentarian also work full-time at the federation of german trade unions , the debate over lobbyists in parliament is now increasingly focused on göhner .
in recent interviews , three bundestag vice-presidents , including social democrat susanne kastner , urged the cdu politician to decide on one of his two positions . " what goes for röttgen must also apply to göhner and co . , " the head of the green party , reinhard bütikofer , told the bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine called for a unified fight but göhner told the berliner zeitung that he can see no conflict of interest , and that none have come up in the past 10 years . " in the future i will carry out my parliamentary mandate carefully and independently , " he told the newspaper .
" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .

i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence .

ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .

if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .

" due to the weakness of the lebanese army , israel supports the possibility of deploying a multinational force with a strong mandate , " a defense ministry official quoted amir peretz as saying , adding that the force could be sponsored by the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half a million people are homeless in lebanon , the un said israeli prime minister ehud olmert told steinmeier that israel would only accept a strong eu force with battle experience . " israel is ready to see deployment of a force with military capabilities and combat experience made up of troops from european union countries once its mandate has been fixed , " olmert said . the mandate " will have to include control of the border crossings between syria and lebanon , deployment in south lebanon and support for the lebanese army , " he added . so far , there are no concrete proposals on the table , but german officials were optimistic the the plan would move forward . " i am banking on finding a rapid solution , " steinmeier said .
" because i am convinced that the sooner we find a separate solution to the conflict in the gaza strip , the sooner we will begin to solve the problem on the northern israel-lebanon border and end the hostilities . " delicate questions there could be delicate questions , however , on whether the force 's mission is to disarm hezbollah or to support the lebanese army 's efforts to take control in the south of the country . " the discussions have not yet reached the stage where we can describe exactly what form such a security presence would take , " steinmeier said .
" it could be a strengthening of the lebanese military , it could mean taking over border control , but could be something else .
we need to draw up a list of duties first and then spread the work out between an international task-force .
i hope we can set off on the road to peace within the next few days . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is open to a multinational force but is not likely to participate us secretary of state condoleezza rice had already stated that the united states was open to the proposal .
she will discuss it on her crisis mission to the middle east and italy this week . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora said , however , that the united nations should take the lead if an international force is to be established .
siniora , who called for an immediate ceasefire , said no concrete proposals have been offered for a multinational force . a multilateral presence however , on sunday mohamad chatah , an advisor to siniora , said the issue of a multinational force is " not at the center of the problem . " " what - you send troops to finish a war that israel could n't finish , " he asked on cnn .
" and unless we have a clear solution to these problems and a political framework , a multinational force , whether nato or a un force , does n't make a whole lot of sense . " israeli media reported that the country could envisage an eu force controlling the border between lebanon and syria , similar to the successful operation between egypt and the gaza strip .
peretz told steinmeier that the release of the israeli soldiers was a pre-requisite for an end to the fighting . germany in 2004 brokered a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah .
steinmeier played a leading role in that operation , but berlin has not confirmed press reports that german intelligence agents were trying to solve the current hostage crisis . humanitarian disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said humanitarian aid ca n't get through steinmeier said that progress has been made towards persuading israel to open safe corridors in lebanon and to allow an international force to deploy in the war-torn country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2006 germans face dilemma as israel warms to un peace force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is slowly accepting the idea of a un force made up of eu troops - including germans talk of a multinational peace-keeping force for lebanon is causing germany a political headache as it debates sending troops to israel 's borders .
germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .
" and we are in close contact with ngos on the ground to coordinate our relief efforts . " while this would be a start , with growing calls for an international force to be put in place within the next week , germany may find itself making a tough decision on deployment in the coming days . bundestag divisions over deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un already has observers in lebanon discussions on a deployment in the bundestag have so far been heated .
gregor gysi , the floor leader of the opposition left party in the national parliament , categorically rejected the idea of any german troops participating in a middle east stabilization force .
he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .
but several mps from the ruling christian and social democrats have indicated that they 'd have fewer qualms about making german soldiers part of such a mission as long as israel itself gave its backing for such a move . diplomats , spies brokering deal meanwhile , the german focus remains on ceasefire before any troops go in .
gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop . " we have so-called ' sounding out ' teams consisting of regional specialists holding discussions in damascus and beirut , and also with the united nations at the moment , " erler said .
" there seems to be movement , a possibility , in the area of prisoner exchange .
there is now interesting news from hezbollah that they would be prepared to begin negotiations .
the ' sounding out ' teams are attempting to pave the way for this . " a ceasefire brought about by a mutual prisoner exchange would allow the multinational force to enter lebanon to keep the peace , not stop the war .
this in turn would decrease the distasteful possibility of german troops being called upon to fight in the middle east .

germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .
" and we are in close contact with ngos on the ground to coordinate our relief efforts . " while this would be a start , with growing calls for an international force to be put in place within the next week , germany may find itself making a tough decision on deployment in the coming days . bundestag divisions over deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un already has observers in lebanon discussions on a deployment in the bundestag have so far been heated .
gregor gysi , the floor leader of the opposition left party in the national parliament , categorically rejected the idea of any german troops participating in a middle east stabilization force .
he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .
but several mps from the ruling christian and social democrats have indicated that they 'd have fewer qualms about making german soldiers part of such a mission as long as israel itself gave its backing for such a move . diplomats , spies brokering deal meanwhile , the german focus remains on ceasefire before any troops go in .
gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop . " we have so-called ' sounding out ' teams consisting of regional specialists holding discussions in damascus and beirut , and also with the united nations at the moment , " erler said .
" there seems to be movement , a possibility , in the area of prisoner exchange .
there is now interesting news from hezbollah that they would be prepared to begin negotiations .
the ' sounding out ' teams are attempting to pave the way for this . " a ceasefire brought about by a mutual prisoner exchange would allow the multinational force to enter lebanon to keep the peace , not stop the war .
this in turn would decrease the distasteful possibility of german troops being called upon to fight in the middle east .

" we risk weakening the wto and the multilateral trading system at a time when we urgently need to top up international confidence , not further damage it , " mandelson said after the collapse of a meeting of six influential wto nations . " as well as an economic cost , there is a huge political cost of failure , " he told journalists . in a report last week , the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said progress at the wto was " urgently needed " to " reinforce " crucial agricultural reform in some rich countries " and re-start it in others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said the wto missed a big chance for fair trade german agriculture minister horst seehofer said he was disappointed with the meeting 's result . " a historic chance to create fair rules for the trade of agricultural and industrial goods was missed , " he said from berlin .
the eu delegation at the talks was responsible for representing germany and the bloc 's other member states . last year , under its then british presidency , the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- also pinpointed a wto deal as a key plank in global efforts to eradicate poverty in the developing nations on top of massive aid package . " you can give them four more months , give them four more years , give them four more centuries , but unless the eu and the us make fundamental changes to their offers then these talks will fail development , " said celine charveriat of the international development charity oxfam .
" the potential for world trade to help poorer countries to develop will be lost . " washington blamed for failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade minister kamal nath indian trade minister kamal nath blamed the united states for the collapse of the talks , saying washington had not matched flexibility shown by the eu and other wto nations on farm trade . " i do n't want to get into the blame game , " he said .
" but it 's very clear that the eu made a movement .
everyone put something on the table except for one country , who said : ' we ca n't see anything on the table . ' " the round is not dead .
but it 's definitely between intensive care and the crematorium , " nath added .
" this failure is a significant failure .
the failure is inherently because of the gap in mind-sets .

" we risk weakening the wto and the multilateral trading system at a time when we urgently need to top up international confidence , not further damage it , " mandelson said after the collapse of a meeting of six influential wto nations . " as well as an economic cost , there is a huge political cost of failure , " he told journalists . in a report last week , the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said progress at the wto was " urgently needed " to " reinforce " crucial agricultural reform in some rich countries " and re-start it in others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said the wto missed a big chance for fair trade german agriculture minister horst seehofer said he was disappointed with the meeting 's result . " a historic chance to create fair rules for the trade of agricultural and industrial goods was missed , " he said from berlin .
the eu delegation at the talks was responsible for representing germany and the bloc 's other member states . last year , under its then british presidency , the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- also pinpointed a wto deal as a key plank in global efforts to eradicate poverty in the developing nations on top of massive aid package . " you can give them four more months , give them four more years , give them four more centuries , but unless the eu and the us make fundamental changes to their offers then these talks will fail development , " said celine charveriat of the international development charity oxfam .
" the potential for world trade to help poorer countries to develop will be lost . " washington blamed for failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade minister kamal nath indian trade minister kamal nath blamed the united states for the collapse of the talks , saying washington had not matched flexibility shown by the eu and other wto nations on farm trade . " i do n't want to get into the blame game , " he said .
" but it 's very clear that the eu made a movement .
everyone put something on the table except for one country , who said : ' we ca n't see anything on the table . ' " the round is not dead .
but it 's definitely between intensive care and the crematorium , " nath added .
" this failure is a significant failure .
the failure is inherently because of the gap in mind-sets .
unless we are able to bridge this gap , there is no future for this round . " the troubled effort to bring down agricultural and industrial barriers was dubbed the doha development agenda when it was launched in the qatari capital in 2001 . history shows perseverance works it was proclaimed as a way to stimulate developing nations by allowing them to sell their produce more freely in wealthy countries and to stop rich nation subsidies distorting world prices . subsidy and tariff cuts in farming are a left over from previous failure to resolve the issues under the wto 's predecessor , the general agreement on tariffs and trade -lrb- gatt -rrb- , and the deal that led to the creation of the wto in 1995 .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great . " mr. röttgens ' decision not to take the job is a warning to all association officers who are also in the german bundestag , " said dirk niebel , the general secretary of the opposition fdp party . pressure on göhner while two members of the opposition left party and one spd parliamentarian also work full-time at the federation of german trade unions , the debate over lobbyists in parliament is now increasingly focused on göhner .
in recent interviews , three bundestag vice-presidents , including social democrat susanne kastner , urged the cdu politician to decide on one of his two positions . " what goes for röttgen must also apply to göhner and co . , " the head of the green party , reinhard bütikofer , told the bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine called for a unified fight but göhner told the berliner zeitung that he can see no conflict of interest , and that none have come up in the past 10 years . " in the future i will carry out my parliamentary mandate carefully and independently , " he told the newspaper .
" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate . consumer affairs minister horst seehofer told a major german newspaper over the weekend that 2007 will be the year smoking becomes illegal in public buildings in germany . " i expect that we will have a smoking ban sometime during 2007 , " he told the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he said the ban will be put on the agenda when parliament reconvenes after its summer break . " common sense , and necessary " germany is one of a dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants .
seehofer said it was not acceptable that people can just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says further debate on pubs and restaurants is needed but whether or not the ban extends to pubs and restaurants still needs to be debated , seehofer added .
that comment elicited angry responses from political opponents and physicians . seehofer noted that restaurants have " actually said they are prepared to create more non-smoking sections . "
but , he added , " to date , i am very unhappy with the progress .
the pubs have moved much too slowly toward creating more non-smoking areas . " künast urges movement greens parliamentary party leader renate künast told news agencies that seehofer should " stop giving sound bites " on the matter and " finally do his homework . "
she called the rejuvenated debate on pubs and smoking a diversionary tactic from the fact that seehofer has not yet put into effect a promised ban on tobacco advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : künast held seehofer 's job under the previous government meanwhile , the president of the german physicians ' association responded critically to seehofer 's comments .
jörg-dietrich hoppe said that politicians should put into place a " consistent " smoking ban that would extend to restaurants and pubs . in a statement to the tagesspiegel newspaper , hoppe urged the politicians not to do " just half a job . "
he said including pubs and restaurants in the smoking ban is a must . he also sharply criticized the association of hotels and inns , which he blames for trying to skirt measures to provide non-smoking areas for patrons .
there is reportedly no proof that the association has been holding its members to an agreed-to goal of 30 percent non-smoking seats in 30 percent of pubs by march of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german smokers facing tough times protecting public health is the right thing to do , but the eu 's tobacco advertising ban is the wrong way to go about it , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2006 germans face dilemma as israel warms to un peace force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is slowly accepting the idea of a un force made up of eu troops - including germans talk of a multinational peace-keeping force for lebanon is causing germany a political headache as it debates sending troops to israel 's borders .
germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .

germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quarters were apparently too close to defend the car with a cane a german in poland lost at least one of his most prized possessions when a thief made off with his bmw 5 series - with his grandfather in back of the car . whether deserved or not , poland has the reputation of being a major european auto-theft capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2006 germans face dilemma as israel warms to un peace force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is slowly accepting the idea of a un force made up of eu troops - including germans talk of a multinational peace-keeping force for lebanon is causing germany a political headache as it debates sending troops to israel 's borders .
germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .

through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .

he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .

gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop .

germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .

reports of organized crime rings targeting luxury models and high-end minivans , destined for resale at points further east , are common .
so 34-year-old german bernhard massl should have known enough not to take any chances when he parked his brand new bmw 5 series outside a florist shop in the polish town of zgorzelec .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmws and other luxury cars are sought after by auto thieves but if massl figured the old man , who no doubt told his grandson to keep the doors locked and to be careful of strangers , would act as a living and breathing anti-theft device , he figured wrong .
when the young whipper-snapper emerged from the florist , the car was gone - octogenarian and all .
fortunately , falk was found unharmed a few miles away .
it seems the thief simply had n't noticed the elderly gentleman in the back seat .
" he did n't notice me at all until i asked him where he was taking me , " falk said . "
he was really startled when he realized he was not alone and immediately pulled over to let me out . "

" due to the weakness of the lebanese army , israel supports the possibility of deploying a multinational force with a strong mandate , " a defense ministry official quoted amir peretz as saying , adding that the force could be sponsored by the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half a million people are homeless in lebanon , the un said israeli prime minister ehud olmert told steinmeier that israel would only accept a strong eu force with battle experience . " israel is ready to see deployment of a force with military capabilities and combat experience made up of troops from european union countries once its mandate has been fixed , " olmert said . the mandate " will have to include control of the border crossings between syria and lebanon , deployment in south lebanon and support for the lebanese army , " he added . so far , there are no concrete proposals on the table , but german officials were optimistic the the plan would move forward . " i am banking on finding a rapid solution , " steinmeier said .
" because i am convinced that the sooner we find a separate solution to the conflict in the gaza strip , the sooner we will begin to solve the problem on the northern israel-lebanon border and end the hostilities . " delicate questions there could be delicate questions , however , on whether the force 's mission is to disarm hezbollah or to support the lebanese army 's efforts to take control in the south of the country . " the discussions have not yet reached the stage where we can describe exactly what form such a security presence would take , " steinmeier said .
" it could be a strengthening of the lebanese military , it could mean taking over border control , but could be something else .
we need to draw up a list of duties first and then spread the work out between an international task-force .
i hope we can set off on the road to peace within the next few days . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is open to a multinational force but is not likely to participate us secretary of state condoleezza rice had already stated that the united states was open to the proposal .
she will discuss it on her crisis mission to the middle east and italy this week . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora said , however , that the united nations should take the lead if an international force is to be established .
siniora , who called for an immediate ceasefire , said no concrete proposals have been offered for a multinational force . a multilateral presence however , on sunday mohamad chatah , an advisor to siniora , said the issue of a multinational force is " not at the center of the problem . " " what - you send troops to finish a war that israel could n't finish , " he asked on cnn .
" and unless we have a clear solution to these problems and a political framework , a multinational force , whether nato or a un force , does n't make a whole lot of sense . " israeli media reported that the country could envisage an eu force controlling the border between lebanon and syria , similar to the successful operation between egypt and the gaza strip .
peretz told steinmeier that the release of the israeli soldiers was a pre-requisite for an end to the fighting . germany in 2004 brokered a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah .
steinmeier played a leading role in that operation , but berlin has not confirmed press reports that german intelligence agents were trying to solve the current hostage crisis . humanitarian disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said humanitarian aid ca n't get through steinmeier said that progress has been made towards persuading israel to open safe corridors in lebanon and to allow an international force to deploy in the war-torn country .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great . " mr. röttgens ' decision not to take the job is a warning to all association officers who are also in the german bundestag , " said dirk niebel , the general secretary of the opposition fdp party . pressure on göhner while two members of the opposition left party and one spd parliamentarian also work full-time at the federation of german trade unions , the debate over lobbyists in parliament is now increasingly focused on göhner .
in recent interviews , three bundestag vice-presidents , including social democrat susanne kastner , urged the cdu politician to decide on one of his two positions . " what goes for röttgen must also apply to göhner and co . , " the head of the green party , reinhard bütikofer , told the bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine called for a unified fight but göhner told the berliner zeitung that he can see no conflict of interest , and that none have come up in the past 10 years . " in the future i will carry out my parliamentary mandate carefully and independently , " he told the newspaper .
" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything . " in a country governed by law , not only i but every individual is innocent until proven guilty , " ullrich said in a statement posted on his web site . former champion sacked by fax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich called the manner of his dismissal " unacceptable " t-mobile sacked ullrich and sevilla when both riders failed to respond to an ultimatum : prove you are not linked to the ongoing doping affair .
ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .
dismissal was the logical outcome . " no positive test or proof of innocence " for us it 's not a witch-hunt .
jan will always be the first ever german to win the tour de france , but at the same time we are not saying that he was doped .
however we have no proof of his innocence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping investigation continues " we made this decision because we believe , looking at the information provided by investigators , that jan ullrich is implicated in the spanish doping affair , " t-mobile spokesman christian frommert added .

" despite rumors of a meeting between the former olympic champion and t-mobile officials in a bid for reconciliation , ullrich 's future in cycling remains in doubt . a career of awards and controversy his suspension from cycling will last as long as the investigation into his alleged involvement in the doping scandal .
if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate . consumer affairs minister horst seehofer told a major german newspaper over the weekend that 2007 will be the year smoking becomes illegal in public buildings in germany . " i expect that we will have a smoking ban sometime during 2007 , " he told the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he said the ban will be put on the agenda when parliament reconvenes after its summer break . " common sense , and necessary " germany is one of a dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants .
seehofer said it was not acceptable that people can just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says further debate on pubs and restaurants is needed but whether or not the ban extends to pubs and restaurants still needs to be debated , seehofer added .
that comment elicited angry responses from political opponents and physicians . seehofer noted that restaurants have " actually said they are prepared to create more non-smoking sections . "

shiite guerrillas responded with a new hail of rocket fire on israel 's third city of haifa , killing two people . streams of people , many waving white flags , are making a desperate trek from southern lebanon after israel ordered them to leave their homes , raising fears it was planning a large scale ground invasion . around 360 people have been killed in israel 's massive blitz against lebanon which was launched after the capture of two soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas in a deadly border attack on july 12 .
a total of 37 israelis have died . syria to intervene if israel invades syria , blamed by the united states for stoking the conflict , warned that if israel invaded lebanon it would have no choice but to respond .
" if israel makes a land entry into lebanon , they can get to within 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- of damascus , " information minister moshen bilal told the spanish newspaper abc . " what will we do ?
stand by with our arms folded ?
absolutely not .
without any doubt syria will intervene in the conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incursions into lebanon have hit strategic sights israel , which has called up thousands of reserve soldiers nd massed its troops on the border , seized control of the strategic hilltop village of marun al-ras on saturday after sending tanks , bulldozers and armored cars rolling across the border . an unarmed un military observer was seriously wounded in an exchange of fire in the village sunday .
the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- said initial reports suggested hezbollah fire was responsible . ground assault " no invasion " defense minister amir peretz insisted israel did not plan a wide scale invasion .
" the ground operation is focusing on a limited entry of forces , " he told the cabinet .
" we are not dealing with an invasion of lebanon . " but his reassurances failed to stop mounting international criticism of the israeli offensive , which has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . " the whole thing has to stop .
it 's no natural disaster but a man-made crisis .
this is a senseless war , " un relief coordinator jan egeland said . he was in beirut to launch an appeal for millions of dollars in aid to help the half million civilians displaced in what the united nations says is a " catastrophic " humanitarian situation . britain belatedly joins chorus of disapproval even close us ally britain , which had drawn arab anger for declining to back un calls for an immediate ceasefire , stepped up its criticism of the israeli offensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain criticized israel 's targeting tactics " these are not surgical strikes .
it 's very difficult to understand the kind of military tactics that are being used , " junior foreign office minister kim howells said in beirut .
" if they are chasing hezbollah , then go for hezbollah .
you do n't go for the entire lebanese nation .
i very much hope that the americans understand what 's happening to lebanon - the destruction of the infrastructure , the death of so many children and so many people .

" we risk weakening the wto and the multilateral trading system at a time when we urgently need to top up international confidence , not further damage it , " mandelson said after the collapse of a meeting of six influential wto nations . " as well as an economic cost , there is a huge political cost of failure , " he told journalists . in a report last week , the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said progress at the wto was " urgently needed " to " reinforce " crucial agricultural reform in some rich countries " and re-start it in others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said the wto missed a big chance for fair trade german agriculture minister horst seehofer said he was disappointed with the meeting 's result . " a historic chance to create fair rules for the trade of agricultural and industrial goods was missed , " he said from berlin .
the eu delegation at the talks was responsible for representing germany and the bloc 's other member states . last year , under its then british presidency , the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- also pinpointed a wto deal as a key plank in global efforts to eradicate poverty in the developing nations on top of massive aid package . " you can give them four more months , give them four more years , give them four more centuries , but unless the eu and the us make fundamental changes to their offers then these talks will fail development , " said celine charveriat of the international development charity oxfam .
" the potential for world trade to help poorer countries to develop will be lost . " washington blamed for failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade minister kamal nath indian trade minister kamal nath blamed the united states for the collapse of the talks , saying washington had not matched flexibility shown by the eu and other wto nations on farm trade . " i do n't want to get into the blame game , " he said .
" but it 's very clear that the eu made a movement .
everyone put something on the table except for one country , who said : ' we ca n't see anything on the table . ' " the round is not dead .
but it 's definitely between intensive care and the crematorium , " nath added .
" this failure is a significant failure .
the failure is inherently because of the gap in mind-sets .
unless we are able to bridge this gap , there is no future for this round . " the troubled effort to bring down agricultural and industrial barriers was dubbed the doha development agenda when it was launched in the qatari capital in 2001 . history shows perseverance works it was proclaimed as a way to stimulate developing nations by allowing them to sell their produce more freely in wealthy countries and to stop rich nation subsidies distorting world prices . subsidy and tariff cuts in farming are a left over from previous failure to resolve the issues under the wto 's predecessor , the general agreement on tariffs and trade -lrb- gatt -rrb- , and the deal that led to the creation of the wto in 1995 . " even though today truly represents a failure , this is not the time to pull offers off the table , to talk about take it or leave it , " us secretary for agriculture mike johanns said in geneva .
" if you look at the history of the uruguay round , it stopped and started a number of times . " after missing the original deadline to complete the doha round by 2005 , the international community had been counting on securing the outlines of deal this summer in order to complete it by the end of the 2006 . expiring us power to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush with mike johanns in july 2007 , us president george w. bush will lose his special " fast-track " trading authority , which allows the white house to make deals that can be either approved or rejected by congress , but not amended . even though the eu and india were blaming washington 's allegedly inflexible stance on agriculture for the failure of monday 's meeting , the expiration of fast-track will make any global trade deal even harder to achieve in the future . the us congress , and the domestic us farming lobby , would have even greater leverage on washington 's stance on cuts to domestic support , or concessions from other countries , than they have now . " the timeout has been called in the talks .
that does not mean that it is not possible to pick up in the future , " eu agriculture commissioner marianne fischer boel said .
" it is a big failure .
if it 's going to be definite , only time will tell .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate . consumer affairs minister horst seehofer told a major german newspaper over the weekend that 2007 will be the year smoking becomes illegal in public buildings in germany . " i expect that we will have a smoking ban sometime during 2007 , " he told the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he said the ban will be put on the agenda when parliament reconvenes after its summer break . " common sense , and necessary " germany is one of a dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants .
seehofer said it was not acceptable that people can just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says further debate on pubs and restaurants is needed but whether or not the ban extends to pubs and restaurants still needs to be debated , seehofer added .
that comment elicited angry responses from political opponents and physicians . seehofer noted that restaurants have " actually said they are prepared to create more non-smoking sections . "
but , he added , " to date , i am very unhappy with the progress .
the pubs have moved much too slowly toward creating more non-smoking areas . " künast urges movement greens parliamentary party leader renate künast told news agencies that seehofer should " stop giving sound bites " on the matter and " finally do his homework . "
she called the rejuvenated debate on pubs and smoking a diversionary tactic from the fact that seehofer has not yet put into effect a promised ban on tobacco advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : künast held seehofer 's job under the previous government meanwhile , the president of the german physicians ' association responded critically to seehofer 's comments .
jörg-dietrich hoppe said that politicians should put into place a " consistent " smoking ban that would extend to restaurants and pubs . in a statement to the tagesspiegel newspaper , hoppe urged the politicians not to do " just half a job . "
he said including pubs and restaurants in the smoking ban is a must . he also sharply criticized the association of hotels and inns , which he blames for trying to skirt measures to provide non-smoking areas for patrons .

" we risk weakening the wto and the multilateral trading system at a time when we urgently need to top up international confidence , not further damage it , " mandelson said after the collapse of a meeting of six influential wto nations . " as well as an economic cost , there is a huge political cost of failure , " he told journalists . in a report last week , the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said progress at the wto was " urgently needed " to " reinforce " crucial agricultural reform in some rich countries " and re-start it in others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said the wto missed a big chance for fair trade german agriculture minister horst seehofer said he was disappointed with the meeting 's result . " a historic chance to create fair rules for the trade of agricultural and industrial goods was missed , " he said from berlin .
the eu delegation at the talks was responsible for representing germany and the bloc 's other member states . last year , under its then british presidency , the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- also pinpointed a wto deal as a key plank in global efforts to eradicate poverty in the developing nations on top of massive aid package . " you can give them four more months , give them four more years , give them four more centuries , but unless the eu and the us make fundamental changes to their offers then these talks will fail development , " said celine charveriat of the international development charity oxfam .
" the potential for world trade to help poorer countries to develop will be lost . " washington blamed for failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade minister kamal nath indian trade minister kamal nath blamed the united states for the collapse of the talks , saying washington had not matched flexibility shown by the eu and other wto nations on farm trade . " i do n't want to get into the blame game , " he said .
" but it 's very clear that the eu made a movement .
everyone put something on the table except for one country , who said : ' we ca n't see anything on the table . ' " the round is not dead .
but it 's definitely between intensive care and the crematorium , " nath added .
" this failure is a significant failure .
the failure is inherently because of the gap in mind-sets .
unless we are able to bridge this gap , there is no future for this round . " the troubled effort to bring down agricultural and industrial barriers was dubbed the doha development agenda when it was launched in the qatari capital in 2001 . history shows perseverance works it was proclaimed as a way to stimulate developing nations by allowing them to sell their produce more freely in wealthy countries and to stop rich nation subsidies distorting world prices . subsidy and tariff cuts in farming are a left over from previous failure to resolve the issues under the wto 's predecessor , the general agreement on tariffs and trade -lrb- gatt -rrb- , and the deal that led to the creation of the wto in 1995 . " even though today truly represents a failure , this is not the time to pull offers off the table , to talk about take it or leave it , " us secretary for agriculture mike johanns said in geneva .
" if you look at the history of the uruguay round , it stopped and started a number of times . " after missing the original deadline to complete the doha round by 2005 , the international community had been counting on securing the outlines of deal this summer in order to complete it by the end of the 2006 . expiring us power to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush with mike johanns in july 2007 , us president george w. bush will lose his special " fast-track " trading authority , which allows the white house to make deals that can be either approved or rejected by congress , but not amended . even though the eu and india were blaming washington 's allegedly inflexible stance on agriculture for the failure of monday 's meeting , the expiration of fast-track will make any global trade deal even harder to achieve in the future . the us congress , and the domestic us farming lobby , would have even greater leverage on washington 's stance on cuts to domestic support , or concessions from other countries , than they have now . " the timeout has been called in the talks .
that does not mean that it is not possible to pick up in the future , " eu agriculture commissioner marianne fischer boel said .
" it is a big failure .
if it 's going to be definite , only time will tell .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything . " in a country governed by law , not only i but every individual is innocent until proven guilty , " ullrich said in a statement posted on his web site . former champion sacked by fax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich called the manner of his dismissal " unacceptable " t-mobile sacked ullrich and sevilla when both riders failed to respond to an ultimatum : prove you are not linked to the ongoing doping affair .
ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .
dismissal was the logical outcome . " no positive test or proof of innocence " for us it 's not a witch-hunt .
jan will always be the first ever german to win the tour de france , but at the same time we are not saying that he was doped .
however we have no proof of his innocence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping investigation continues " we made this decision because we believe , looking at the information provided by investigators , that jan ullrich is implicated in the spanish doping affair , " t-mobile spokesman christian frommert added .
" however ullrich has not returned a positive doping test . " despite rumors of a meeting between the former olympic champion and t-mobile officials in a bid for reconciliation , ullrich 's future in cycling remains in doubt . a career of awards and controversy his suspension from cycling will last as long as the investigation into his alleged involvement in the doping scandal .
if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .
any positive outcome in this latest doping scandal will over-shadow his entire career . if ullrich is to retire in ignominious circumstances , it will be a sadly fitting career end for a rider who would be remembered as the german cyclist of the century who could have achieved even more than he did . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cyclist jan ullrich sacked amid doping allegations former tour de france champion jan ullrich , excluded from this year 's race because of allegations of blood-doping , has been sacked by his t-mobile team .

however , the eu said unspecified " subsequent steps " involving human embryonic stem cells would not be included in the ban and would be eligible for funding . " the financing ... from eu funds is possible , but subject to very tight ethical rules and procedures , " said jukka pekkarinen , head of the finance ministry 's economics department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan eight countries - germany , austria , poland , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania luxembourg and malta - were looking to block funding for all embryonic stem cell research . but with the 51 billion euros -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- 2007-2013 financial package for science funding waiting for the green light , eu ministers were forced to compromise to keep large , long-term projects operating into next year without disruption . until monday , the eight countries insisted the common eu budget should not be used for activities banned in some member states , despite the argument that such research could be crucial in finding cures for chronic diseases such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
germany led the call for a ban germany had been at the forefront of the call for a total ban before changing its stance in the final hours of the ministers ' meeting .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great . " mr. röttgens ' decision not to take the job is a warning to all association officers who are also in the german bundestag , " said dirk niebel , the general secretary of the opposition fdp party . pressure on göhner while two members of the opposition left party and one spd parliamentarian also work full-time at the federation of german trade unions , the debate over lobbyists in parliament is now increasingly focused on göhner .
in recent interviews , three bundestag vice-presidents , including social democrat susanne kastner , urged the cdu politician to decide on one of his two positions . " what goes for röttgen must also apply to göhner and co . , " the head of the green party , reinhard bütikofer , told the bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine called for a unified fight but göhner told the berliner zeitung that he can see no conflict of interest , and that none have come up in the past 10 years . " in the future i will carry out my parliamentary mandate carefully and independently , " he told the newspaper .
" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.07.2006 eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research . european union ministers went some way to appeasing eight of the bloc 's members , including germany , who had called for a complete ban of stem cell research funding when it was announced that the money would allow limited use of eu cash for research involving human embryonic stem cells . the agreement bans research that involves destroying human embryos , including for the procurement of stem cells .
however , the eu said unspecified " subsequent steps " involving human embryonic stem cells would not be included in the ban and would be eligible for funding . " the financing ... from eu funds is possible , but subject to very tight ethical rules and procedures , " said jukka pekkarinen , head of the finance ministry 's economics department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan eight countries - germany , austria , poland , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania luxembourg and malta - were looking to block funding for all embryonic stem cell research . but with the 51 billion euros -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- 2007-2013 financial package for science funding waiting for the green light , eu ministers were forced to compromise to keep large , long-term projects operating into next year without disruption . until monday , the eight countries insisted the common eu budget should not be used for activities banned in some member states , despite the argument that such research could be crucial in finding cures for chronic diseases such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
germany led the call for a ban germany had been at the forefront of the call for a total ban before changing its stance in the final hours of the ministers ' meeting .
german research minister annette schavan sent a letter last week to the eu presidency condemning the idea of eu cash being used for stem cell research . # b # " the european union science program should not be used to give financial incentives to kill embryos , " she wrote before the meeting .
" the current proposal from the european commission and the european parliament does not rule this out . " italy , luxembourg and slovenia joined germany in dropped their objections to the funding , while poland , lithuania , malta , slovakia and austria refused to sign on to the agreement . the eu found itself in a similar disagreement over genetic-related research before it adopted its science funding package for 2000-2006 .
the outcome of that discussion produced the current system of a case-by-case approach to stem cell-based projects which needs to pass several stages of national and eu ethical committees screening .
this type of research also can not be carried out in member states where it is banned by national legislation .
but opponents of the package insist this is not enough .
the controversial issue of stem cell research is a relatively minor one in terms of the total eu funding but it is viewed as a political and ideological bombshell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .

" due to the weakness of the lebanese army , israel supports the possibility of deploying a multinational force with a strong mandate , " a defense ministry official quoted amir peretz as saying , adding that the force could be sponsored by the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half a million people are homeless in lebanon , the un said israeli prime minister ehud olmert told steinmeier that israel would only accept a strong eu force with battle experience . " israel is ready to see deployment of a force with military capabilities and combat experience made up of troops from european union countries once its mandate has been fixed , " olmert said . the mandate " will have to include control of the border crossings between syria and lebanon , deployment in south lebanon and support for the lebanese army , " he added . so far , there are no concrete proposals on the table , but german officials were optimistic the the plan would move forward . " i am banking on finding a rapid solution , " steinmeier said .
" because i am convinced that the sooner we find a separate solution to the conflict in the gaza strip , the sooner we will begin to solve the problem on the northern israel-lebanon border and end the hostilities . " delicate questions there could be delicate questions , however , on whether the force 's mission is to disarm hezbollah or to support the lebanese army 's efforts to take control in the south of the country . " the discussions have not yet reached the stage where we can describe exactly what form such a security presence would take , " steinmeier said .
" it could be a strengthening of the lebanese military , it could mean taking over border control , but could be something else .
we need to draw up a list of duties first and then spread the work out between an international task-force .
i hope we can set off on the road to peace within the next few days . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is open to a multinational force but is not likely to participate us secretary of state condoleezza rice had already stated that the united states was open to the proposal .
she will discuss it on her crisis mission to the middle east and italy this week . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora said , however , that the united nations should take the lead if an international force is to be established .
siniora , who called for an immediate ceasefire , said no concrete proposals have been offered for a multinational force . a multilateral presence however , on sunday mohamad chatah , an advisor to siniora , said the issue of a multinational force is " not at the center of the problem . " " what - you send troops to finish a war that israel could n't finish , " he asked on cnn .
" and unless we have a clear solution to these problems and a political framework , a multinational force , whether nato or a un force , does n't make a whole lot of sense . " israeli media reported that the country could envisage an eu force controlling the border between lebanon and syria , similar to the successful operation between egypt and the gaza strip .
peretz told steinmeier that the release of the israeli soldiers was a pre-requisite for an end to the fighting . germany in 2004 brokered a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.07.2006 eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research . european union ministers went some way to appeasing eight of the bloc 's members , including germany , who had called for a complete ban of stem cell research funding when it was announced that the money would allow limited use of eu cash for research involving human embryonic stem cells . the agreement bans research that involves destroying human embryos , including for the procurement of stem cells .
however , the eu said unspecified " subsequent steps " involving human embryonic stem cells would not be included in the ban and would be eligible for funding . " the financing ... from eu funds is possible , but subject to very tight ethical rules and procedures , " said jukka pekkarinen , head of the finance ministry 's economics department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan eight countries - germany , austria , poland , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania luxembourg and malta - were looking to block funding for all embryonic stem cell research . but with the 51 billion euros -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- 2007-2013 financial package for science funding waiting for the green light , eu ministers were forced to compromise to keep large , long-term projects operating into next year without disruption . until monday , the eight countries insisted the common eu budget should not be used for activities banned in some member states , despite the argument that such research could be crucial in finding cures for chronic diseases such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
germany led the call for a ban germany had been at the forefront of the call for a total ban before changing its stance in the final hours of the ministers ' meeting .
german research minister annette schavan sent a letter last week to the eu presidency condemning the idea of eu cash being used for stem cell research . # b # " the european union science program should not be used to give financial incentives to kill embryos , " she wrote before the meeting .
" the current proposal from the european commission and the european parliament does not rule this out . " italy , luxembourg and slovenia joined germany in dropped their objections to the funding , while poland , lithuania , malta , slovakia and austria refused to sign on to the agreement . the eu found itself in a similar disagreement over genetic-related research before it adopted its science funding package for 2000-2006 .
the outcome of that discussion produced the current system of a case-by-case approach to stem cell-based projects which needs to pass several stages of national and eu ethical committees screening .
this type of research also can not be carried out in member states where it is banned by national legislation .
but opponents of the package insist this is not enough .
the controversial issue of stem cell research is a relatively minor one in terms of the total eu funding but it is viewed as a political and ideological bombshell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .
-lrb- july 21 , 2006 -rrb- german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .

reports of organized crime rings targeting luxury models and high-end minivans , destined for resale at points further east , are common .

when the young whipper-snapper emerged from the florist , the car was gone - octogenarian and all .
fortunately , falk was found unharmed a few miles away .
it seems the thief simply had n't noticed the elderly gentleman in the back seat .
" he did n't notice me at all until i asked him where he was taking me , " falk said . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2006 germans face dilemma as israel warms to un peace force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is slowly accepting the idea of a un force made up of eu troops - including germans talk of a multinational peace-keeping force for lebanon is causing germany a political headache as it debates sending troops to israel 's borders .
germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .

germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .

italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .
" and we are in close contact with ngos on the ground to coordinate our relief efforts . " while this would be a start , with growing calls for an international force to be put in place within the next week , germany may find itself making a tough decision on deployment in the coming days . bundestag divisions over deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un already has observers in lebanon discussions on a deployment in the bundestag have so far been heated .
gregor gysi , the floor leader of the opposition left party in the national parliament , categorically rejected the idea of any german troops participating in a middle east stabilization force .
he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .
but several mps from the ruling christian and social democrats have indicated that they 'd have fewer qualms about making german soldiers part of such a mission as long as israel itself gave its backing for such a move . diplomats , spies brokering deal meanwhile , the german focus remains on ceasefire before any troops go in .
gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop . " we have so-called ' sounding out ' teams consisting of regional specialists holding discussions in damascus and beirut , and also with the united nations at the moment , " erler said .
" there seems to be movement , a possibility , in the area of prisoner exchange .
there is now interesting news from hezbollah that they would be prepared to begin negotiations .
the ' sounding out ' teams are attempting to pave the way for this . " a ceasefire brought about by a mutual prisoner exchange would allow the multinational force to enter lebanon to keep the peace , not stop the war .
this in turn would decrease the distasteful possibility of german troops being called upon to fight in the middle east .
however , the weight of history will be felt on any decision to deploy the bundeswehr on israel 's borders . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomatic initiatives moving forward in middle east after days of diplomatic efforts , the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to the middle east looks increasingly likely .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate . consumer affairs minister horst seehofer told a major german newspaper over the weekend that 2007 will be the year smoking becomes illegal in public buildings in germany . " i expect that we will have a smoking ban sometime during 2007 , " he told the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he said the ban will be put on the agenda when parliament reconvenes after its summer break . " common sense , and necessary " germany is one of a dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants .
seehofer said it was not acceptable that people can just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says further debate on pubs and restaurants is needed but whether or not the ban extends to pubs and restaurants still needs to be debated , seehofer added .
that comment elicited angry responses from political opponents and physicians . seehofer noted that restaurants have " actually said they are prepared to create more non-smoking sections . "
but , he added , " to date , i am very unhappy with the progress .
the pubs have moved much too slowly toward creating more non-smoking areas . " künast urges movement greens parliamentary party leader renate künast told news agencies that seehofer should " stop giving sound bites " on the matter and " finally do his homework . "
she called the rejuvenated debate on pubs and smoking a diversionary tactic from the fact that seehofer has not yet put into effect a promised ban on tobacco advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : künast held seehofer 's job under the previous government meanwhile , the president of the german physicians ' association responded critically to seehofer 's comments .
jörg-dietrich hoppe said that politicians should put into place a " consistent " smoking ban that would extend to restaurants and pubs . in a statement to the tagesspiegel newspaper , hoppe urged the politicians not to do " just half a job . "
he said including pubs and restaurants in the smoking ban is a must . he also sharply criticized the association of hotels and inns , which he blames for trying to skirt measures to provide non-smoking areas for patrons .
there is reportedly no proof that the association has been holding its members to an agreed-to goal of 30 percent non-smoking seats in 30 percent of pubs by march of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german smokers facing tough times protecting public health is the right thing to do , but the eu 's tobacco advertising ban is the wrong way to go about it , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate . consumer affairs minister horst seehofer told a major german newspaper over the weekend that 2007 will be the year smoking becomes illegal in public buildings in germany . " i expect that we will have a smoking ban sometime during 2007 , " he told the newspaper tagesspiegel am sonntag .
he said the ban will be put on the agenda when parliament reconvenes after its summer break . " common sense , and necessary " germany is one of a dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in either public spaces or bars and restaurants .
seehofer said it was not acceptable that people can just light up in nursing homes , hospitals and other municipal buildings , calling a smoking ban " common sense , and necessary . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says further debate on pubs and restaurants is needed but whether or not the ban extends to pubs and restaurants still needs to be debated , seehofer added .
that comment elicited angry responses from political opponents and physicians . seehofer noted that restaurants have " actually said they are prepared to create more non-smoking sections . "
but , he added , " to date , i am very unhappy with the progress .
the pubs have moved much too slowly toward creating more non-smoking areas . " künast urges movement greens parliamentary party leader renate künast told news agencies that seehofer should " stop giving sound bites " on the matter and " finally do his homework . "
she called the rejuvenated debate on pubs and smoking a diversionary tactic from the fact that seehofer has not yet put into effect a promised ban on tobacco advertising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : künast held seehofer 's job under the previous government meanwhile , the president of the german physicians ' association responded critically to seehofer 's comments .
jörg-dietrich hoppe said that politicians should put into place a " consistent " smoking ban that would extend to restaurants and pubs . in a statement to the tagesspiegel newspaper , hoppe urged the politicians not to do " just half a job . "
he said including pubs and restaurants in the smoking ban is a must . he also sharply criticized the association of hotels and inns , which he blames for trying to skirt measures to provide non-smoking areas for patrons .
there is reportedly no proof that the association has been holding its members to an agreed-to goal of 30 percent non-smoking seats in 30 percent of pubs by march of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german smokers facing tough times protecting public health is the right thing to do , but the eu 's tobacco advertising ban is the wrong way to go about it , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

" due to the weakness of the lebanese army , israel supports the possibility of deploying a multinational force with a strong mandate , " a defense ministry official quoted amir peretz as saying , adding that the force could be sponsored by the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half a million people are homeless in lebanon , the un said israeli prime minister ehud olmert told steinmeier that israel would only accept a strong eu force with battle experience . " israel is ready to see deployment of a force with military capabilities and combat experience made up of troops from european union countries once its mandate has been fixed , " olmert said . the mandate " will have to include control of the border crossings between syria and lebanon , deployment in south lebanon and support for the lebanese army , " he added . so far , there are no concrete proposals on the table , but german officials were optimistic the the plan would move forward . " i am banking on finding a rapid solution , " steinmeier said .
" because i am convinced that the sooner we find a separate solution to the conflict in the gaza strip , the sooner we will begin to solve the problem on the northern israel-lebanon border and end the hostilities . " delicate questions there could be delicate questions , however , on whether the force 's mission is to disarm hezbollah or to support the lebanese army 's efforts to take control in the south of the country . " the discussions have not yet reached the stage where we can describe exactly what form such a security presence would take , " steinmeier said .
" it could be a strengthening of the lebanese military , it could mean taking over border control , but could be something else .
we need to draw up a list of duties first and then spread the work out between an international task-force .
i hope we can set off on the road to peace within the next few days . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is open to a multinational force but is not likely to participate us secretary of state condoleezza rice had already stated that the united states was open to the proposal .
she will discuss it on her crisis mission to the middle east and italy this week . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora said , however , that the united nations should take the lead if an international force is to be established .
siniora , who called for an immediate ceasefire , said no concrete proposals have been offered for a multinational force . a multilateral presence however , on sunday mohamad chatah , an advisor to siniora , said the issue of a multinational force is " not at the center of the problem . " " what - you send troops to finish a war that israel could n't finish , " he asked on cnn .
" and unless we have a clear solution to these problems and a political framework , a multinational force , whether nato or a un force , does n't make a whole lot of sense . " israeli media reported that the country could envisage an eu force controlling the border between lebanon and syria , similar to the successful operation between egypt and the gaza strip .
peretz told steinmeier that the release of the israeli soldiers was a pre-requisite for an end to the fighting . germany in 2004 brokered a prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah .
steinmeier played a leading role in that operation , but berlin has not confirmed press reports that german intelligence agents were trying to solve the current hostage crisis . humanitarian disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un said humanitarian aid ca n't get through steinmeier said that progress has been made towards persuading israel to open safe corridors in lebanon and to allow an international force to deploy in the war-torn country .

jörg-dietrich hoppe said that politicians should put into place a " consistent " smoking ban that would extend to restaurants and pubs . in a statement to the tagesspiegel newspaper , hoppe urged the politicians not to do " just half a job . "
he said including pubs and restaurants in the smoking ban is a must . he also sharply criticized the association of hotels and inns , which he blames for trying to skirt measures to provide non-smoking areas for patrons .
there is reportedly no proof that the association has been holding its members to an agreed-to goal of 30 percent non-smoking seats in 30 percent of pubs by march of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german smokers facing tough times protecting public health is the right thing to do , but the eu 's tobacco advertising ban is the wrong way to go about it , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

" we risk weakening the wto and the multilateral trading system at a time when we urgently need to top up international confidence , not further damage it , " mandelson said after the collapse of a meeting of six influential wto nations . " as well as an economic cost , there is a huge political cost of failure , " he told journalists . in a report last week , the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said progress at the wto was " urgently needed " to " reinforce " crucial agricultural reform in some rich countries " and re-start it in others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said the wto missed a big chance for fair trade german agriculture minister horst seehofer said he was disappointed with the meeting 's result . " a historic chance to create fair rules for the trade of agricultural and industrial goods was missed , " he said from berlin .
the eu delegation at the talks was responsible for representing germany and the bloc 's other member states . last year , under its then british presidency , the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- also pinpointed a wto deal as a key plank in global efforts to eradicate poverty in the developing nations on top of massive aid package . " you can give them four more months , give them four more years , give them four more centuries , but unless the eu and the us make fundamental changes to their offers then these talks will fail development , " said celine charveriat of the international development charity oxfam .
" the potential for world trade to help poorer countries to develop will be lost . " washington blamed for failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade minister kamal nath indian trade minister kamal nath blamed the united states for the collapse of the talks , saying washington had not matched flexibility shown by the eu and other wto nations on farm trade . " i do n't want to get into the blame game , " he said .
" but it 's very clear that the eu made a movement .
everyone put something on the table except for one country , who said : ' we ca n't see anything on the table . ' " the round is not dead .
but it 's definitely between intensive care and the crematorium , " nath added .
" this failure is a significant failure .
the failure is inherently because of the gap in mind-sets .
unless we are able to bridge this gap , there is no future for this round . " the troubled effort to bring down agricultural and industrial barriers was dubbed the doha development agenda when it was launched in the qatari capital in 2001 . history shows perseverance works it was proclaimed as a way to stimulate developing nations by allowing them to sell their produce more freely in wealthy countries and to stop rich nation subsidies distorting world prices . subsidy and tariff cuts in farming are a left over from previous failure to resolve the issues under the wto 's predecessor , the general agreement on tariffs and trade -lrb- gatt -rrb- , and the deal that led to the creation of the wto in 1995 . " even though today truly represents a failure , this is not the time to pull offers off the table , to talk about take it or leave it , " us secretary for agriculture mike johanns said in geneva .
" if you look at the history of the uruguay round , it stopped and started a number of times . " after missing the original deadline to complete the doha round by 2005 , the international community had been counting on securing the outlines of deal this summer in order to complete it by the end of the 2006 . expiring us power to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush with mike johanns in july 2007 , us president george w. bush will lose his special " fast-track " trading authority , which allows the white house to make deals that can be either approved or rejected by congress , but not amended . even though the eu and india were blaming washington 's allegedly inflexible stance on agriculture for the failure of monday 's meeting , the expiration of fast-track will make any global trade deal even harder to achieve in the future . the us congress , and the domestic us farming lobby , would have even greater leverage on washington 's stance on cuts to domestic support , or concessions from other countries , than they have now . " the timeout has been called in the talks .
that does not mean that it is not possible to pick up in the future , " eu agriculture commissioner marianne fischer boel said .
" it is a big failure .

" we risk weakening the wto and the multilateral trading system at a time when we urgently need to top up international confidence , not further damage it , " mandelson said after the collapse of a meeting of six influential wto nations . " as well as an economic cost , there is a huge political cost of failure , " he told journalists . in a report last week , the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said progress at the wto was " urgently needed " to " reinforce " crucial agricultural reform in some rich countries " and re-start it in others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said the wto missed a big chance for fair trade german agriculture minister horst seehofer said he was disappointed with the meeting 's result . " a historic chance to create fair rules for the trade of agricultural and industrial goods was missed , " he said from berlin .
the eu delegation at the talks was responsible for representing germany and the bloc 's other member states . last year , under its then british presidency , the group of eight industrialized nations -lrb- g8 -rrb- also pinpointed a wto deal as a key plank in global efforts to eradicate poverty in the developing nations on top of massive aid package . " you can give them four more months , give them four more years , give them four more centuries , but unless the eu and the us make fundamental changes to their offers then these talks will fail development , " said celine charveriat of the international development charity oxfam .
" the potential for world trade to help poorer countries to develop will be lost . " washington blamed for failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian trade minister kamal nath indian trade minister kamal nath blamed the united states for the collapse of the talks , saying washington had not matched flexibility shown by the eu and other wto nations on farm trade . " i do n't want to get into the blame game , " he said .
" but it 's very clear that the eu made a movement .
everyone put something on the table except for one country , who said : ' we ca n't see anything on the table . ' " the round is not dead .
but it 's definitely between intensive care and the crematorium , " nath added .
" this failure is a significant failure .
the failure is inherently because of the gap in mind-sets .
unless we are able to bridge this gap , there is no future for this round . " the troubled effort to bring down agricultural and industrial barriers was dubbed the doha development agenda when it was launched in the qatari capital in 2001 . history shows perseverance works it was proclaimed as a way to stimulate developing nations by allowing them to sell their produce more freely in wealthy countries and to stop rich nation subsidies distorting world prices . subsidy and tariff cuts in farming are a left over from previous failure to resolve the issues under the wto 's predecessor , the general agreement on tariffs and trade -lrb- gatt -rrb- , and the deal that led to the creation of the wto in 1995 . " even though today truly represents a failure , this is not the time to pull offers off the table , to talk about take it or leave it , " us secretary for agriculture mike johanns said in geneva .
" if you look at the history of the uruguay round , it stopped and started a number of times . " after missing the original deadline to complete the doha round by 2005 , the international community had been counting on securing the outlines of deal this summer in order to complete it by the end of the 2006 . expiring us power to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush with mike johanns in july 2007 , us president george w. bush will lose his special " fast-track " trading authority , which allows the white house to make deals that can be either approved or rejected by congress , but not amended . even though the eu and india were blaming washington 's allegedly inflexible stance on agriculture for the failure of monday 's meeting , the expiration of fast-track will make any global trade deal even harder to achieve in the future . the us congress , and the domestic us farming lobby , would have even greater leverage on washington 's stance on cuts to domestic support , or concessions from other countries , than they have now . " the timeout has been called in the talks .
that does not mean that it is not possible to pick up in the future , " eu agriculture commissioner marianne fischer boel said .
" it is a big failure .
if it 's going to be definite , only time will tell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2006 germans face dilemma as israel warms to un peace force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is slowly accepting the idea of a un force made up of eu troops - including germans talk of a multinational peace-keeping force for lebanon is causing germany a political headache as it debates sending troops to israel 's borders .
germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .
" and we are in close contact with ngos on the ground to coordinate our relief efforts . " while this would be a start , with growing calls for an international force to be put in place within the next week , germany may find itself making a tough decision on deployment in the coming days . bundestag divisions over deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un already has observers in lebanon discussions on a deployment in the bundestag have so far been heated .
gregor gysi , the floor leader of the opposition left party in the national parliament , categorically rejected the idea of any german troops participating in a middle east stabilization force .
he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .
but several mps from the ruling christian and social democrats have indicated that they 'd have fewer qualms about making german soldiers part of such a mission as long as israel itself gave its backing for such a move . diplomats , spies brokering deal meanwhile , the german focus remains on ceasefire before any troops go in .
gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop . " we have so-called ' sounding out ' teams consisting of regional specialists holding discussions in damascus and beirut , and also with the united nations at the moment , " erler said .
" there seems to be movement , a possibility , in the area of prisoner exchange .
there is now interesting news from hezbollah that they would be prepared to begin negotiations .
the ' sounding out ' teams are attempting to pave the way for this . " a ceasefire brought about by a mutual prisoner exchange would allow the multinational force to enter lebanon to keep the peace , not stop the war .
this in turn would decrease the distasteful possibility of german troops being called upon to fight in the middle east .
however , the weight of history will be felt on any decision to deploy the bundeswehr on israel 's borders . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomatic initiatives moving forward in middle east after days of diplomatic efforts , the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to the middle east looks increasingly likely .

" due to the weakness of the lebanese army , israel supports the possibility of deploying a multinational force with a strong mandate , " a defense ministry official quoted amir peretz as saying , adding that the force could be sponsored by the north atlantic treaty organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half a million people are homeless in lebanon , the un said israeli prime minister ehud olmert told steinmeier that israel would only accept a strong eu force with battle experience . " israel is ready to see deployment of a force with military capabilities and combat experience made up of troops from european union countries once its mandate has been fixed , " olmert said . the mandate " will have to include control of the border crossings between syria and lebanon , deployment in south lebanon and support for the lebanese army , " he added . so far , there are no concrete proposals on the table , but german officials were optimistic the the plan would move forward . " i am banking on finding a rapid solution , " steinmeier said .
" because i am convinced that the sooner we find a separate solution to the conflict in the gaza strip , the sooner we will begin to solve the problem on the northern israel-lebanon border and end the hostilities . " delicate questions there could be delicate questions , however , on whether the force 's mission is to disarm hezbollah or to support the lebanese army 's efforts to take control in the south of the country . " the discussions have not yet reached the stage where we can describe exactly what form such a security presence would take , " steinmeier said .
" it could be a strengthening of the lebanese military , it could mean taking over border control , but could be something else .
we need to draw up a list of duties first and then spread the work out between an international task-force .
i hope we can set off on the road to peace within the next few days .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great . " mr. röttgens ' decision not to take the job is a warning to all association officers who are also in the german bundestag , " said dirk niebel , the general secretary of the opposition fdp party . pressure on göhner while two members of the opposition left party and one spd parliamentarian also work full-time at the federation of german trade unions , the debate over lobbyists in parliament is now increasingly focused on göhner .
in recent interviews , three bundestag vice-presidents , including social democrat susanne kastner , urged the cdu politician to decide on one of his two positions . " what goes for röttgen must also apply to göhner and co . , " the head of the green party , reinhard bütikofer , told the bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine called for a unified fight but göhner told the berliner zeitung that he can see no conflict of interest , and that none have come up in the past 10 years . " in the future i will carry out my parliamentary mandate carefully and independently , " he told the newspaper .
" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.07.2006 eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research . european union ministers went some way to appeasing eight of the bloc 's members , including germany , who had called for a complete ban of stem cell research funding when it was announced that the money would allow limited use of eu cash for research involving human embryonic stem cells . the agreement bans research that involves destroying human embryos , including for the procurement of stem cells .
however , the eu said unspecified " subsequent steps " involving human embryonic stem cells would not be included in the ban and would be eligible for funding . " the financing ... from eu funds is possible , but subject to very tight ethical rules and procedures , " said jukka pekkarinen , head of the finance ministry 's economics department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan eight countries - germany , austria , poland , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania luxembourg and malta - were looking to block funding for all embryonic stem cell research . but with the 51 billion euros -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- 2007-2013 financial package for science funding waiting for the green light , eu ministers were forced to compromise to keep large , long-term projects operating into next year without disruption . until monday , the eight countries insisted the common eu budget should not be used for activities banned in some member states , despite the argument that such research could be crucial in finding cures for chronic diseases such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
germany led the call for a ban germany had been at the forefront of the call for a total ban before changing its stance in the final hours of the ministers ' meeting .
german research minister annette schavan sent a letter last week to the eu presidency condemning the idea of eu cash being used for stem cell research . # b # " the european union science program should not be used to give financial incentives to kill embryos , " she wrote before the meeting .
" the current proposal from the european commission and the european parliament does not rule this out . " italy , luxembourg and slovenia joined germany in dropped their objections to the funding , while poland , lithuania , malta , slovakia and austria refused to sign on to the agreement . the eu found itself in a similar disagreement over genetic-related research before it adopted its science funding package for 2000-2006 .
the outcome of that discussion produced the current system of a case-by-case approach to stem cell-based projects which needs to pass several stages of national and eu ethical committees screening .
this type of research also can not be carried out in member states where it is banned by national legislation .
but opponents of the package insist this is not enough .
the controversial issue of stem cell research is a relatively minor one in terms of the total eu funding but it is viewed as a political and ideological bombshell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .

germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one . the violence in the middle east shows no sigh of abating as israeli troops engage hezbollah militia over the border in southern lebanon while the guerrillas send more katjuscha rockets in the opposition direction into towns and villages in northern israel . while the fighting rages , diplomats from around the world shuttle between nations in the region , tying to broker a peace deal or , at the very least , a ceasefire .
italy 's prime minister romano prodi and french foreign secretary philippe douste-blazy are in the middle east meeting arab and israeli leaders , as is us secretary of states condoleezza rice . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier completed his own diplomatic mission this weekend .
but while germany is among those countries calling for a cessation in the violence and one of those within the united nations in favor of a multinational peace-keeping force in lebanon , steinmeier 's job takes on uniquely problematic dimensions when germany is called to mediate in the middle east . initially , steinmeier 's visit appears to have planted tentative seeds of success .
through his discussions with israeli prime minister ehud olmert , israel 's negative stance towards a un peace-keeping force has softened .
whereas before , olmert was against any multinational force in lebanon , he now feels such a presence can contribute to the solution of the conflict . " we are at the beginning of a discussion but a mission if far from certain as yet , " steinmeier said at the weekend .
" the question is whether such a mission should be used to strengthen the lebanese army , whether -lrb- the force -rrb- should have a predominantly border control role or if it should take on other tasks in the region . " israeli pm wants eu troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert and steinmeier made progress on peace troop plan however , the israeli prime minister has other questions , particularly how such a force would be set up and how it would work .
olmert believes it should be made up primarily of troops from the european union as part of a robust mandate from the united nations .
this would mean that germany would be called upon to provide troops , a situation that steinmeier said was problematic . " the participation of germany is a particularly sensitive discussion , " the foreign minister said .
" the difficult common history between germany and israel always comes into it . " chancellor angela merkel is being just as cagey about the possible deployment of german troops in the middle east .
she has made it clear that the most important factor in resolving the crisis is to first stop the violence .
an international force would not be put in place to come between the two warring factions while hostilities are still red-hot .
merkel believes the force 's primary mission would be to strengthen the hand of the lebanese government in dealing with the hezbollah militia on its southern border . " we must give the lebanese government help , " merkel said .
" and we will talk about what kind of contribution we must perform to do this .
but for us to enter the conflict at this moment is not a subject we can talk about at this time . " merkel first offers aid the form of a german contribution may not initially be a military presence .
foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told the media that the government is considering allocating more aid money to ease the plight of civilians caught up in what the un has described as a " humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen . " the german government has so far allocated 2 million euros for immediate humanitarian aid in southern lebanon , " jäger said .
" and we are in close contact with ngos on the ground to coordinate our relief efforts .

gregor gysi , the floor leader of the opposition left party in the national parliament , categorically rejected the idea of any german troops participating in a middle east stabilization force .
he said that would be totally impossible against the background of the holocaust when millions of jews died at the hands of german perpetrators under nazi rule . gysi told reporters that german participation in a peace-enforcing mission was unthinkable , no matter whether it was un-mandated or not .
but several mps from the ruling christian and social democrats have indicated that they 'd have fewer qualms about making german soldiers part of such a mission as long as israel itself gave its backing for such a move . diplomats , spies brokering deal meanwhile , the german focus remains on ceasefire before any troops go in .
gernot erler , a state minister in the foreign office , revealed this weekend that diplomatic teams and secret service personnel were in the middle east attempting to broker a prisoner exchange deal between the warring partners in a bid to get the fighting to stop . " we have so-called ' sounding out ' teams consisting of regional specialists holding discussions in damascus and beirut , and also with the united nations at the moment , " erler said .
" there seems to be movement , a possibility , in the area of prisoner exchange .
there is now interesting news from hezbollah that they would be prepared to begin negotiations .
the ' sounding out ' teams are attempting to pave the way for this . " a ceasefire brought about by a mutual prisoner exchange would allow the multinational force to enter lebanon to keep the peace , not stop the war .

much of the attention is focused cdu parliamentarian reinhard göhner , who is simultaneously the head of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- . decision is " a warning " in contrast to röttgen , göhner has said he plans to simultaneously retain his mp job and the leadership post at the employers ' group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag representatives should only have to report to one workplace , some argue in germany , unlike in the us , it is common practice for elected officials to continue working part time in the private sector while in office .
but the new round of debate pits those who argue that it is important for public servants to keep a foot in the world of business , against those who argue that the potential for conflict of interest is too great . " mr. röttgens ' decision not to take the job is a warning to all association officers who are also in the german bundestag , " said dirk niebel , the general secretary of the opposition fdp party . pressure on göhner while two members of the opposition left party and one spd parliamentarian also work full-time at the federation of german trade unions , the debate over lobbyists in parliament is now increasingly focused on göhner .
in recent interviews , three bundestag vice-presidents , including social democrat susanne kastner , urged the cdu politician to decide on one of his two positions . " what goes for röttgen must also apply to göhner and co . , " the head of the green party , reinhard bütikofer , told the bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine called for a unified fight but göhner told the berliner zeitung that he can see no conflict of interest , and that none have come up in the past 10 years . " in the future i will carry out my parliamentary mandate carefully and independently , " he told the newspaper .
" and i will keep fulfilling my duties for the bda . " meanwhile , oskar lafontaine of the left party told bild am sonntag that röttgen 's decision can only be seen as the first step in a much-needed " unified fight against lobbyists " in parliament .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything . " in a country governed by law , not only i but every individual is innocent until proven guilty , " ullrich said in a statement posted on his web site . former champion sacked by fax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich called the manner of his dismissal " unacceptable " t-mobile sacked ullrich and sevilla when both riders failed to respond to an ultimatum : prove you are not linked to the ongoing doping affair .
ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .
dismissal was the logical outcome . " no positive test or proof of innocence " for us it 's not a witch-hunt .
jan will always be the first ever german to win the tour de france , but at the same time we are not saying that he was doped .
however we have no proof of his innocence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping investigation continues " we made this decision because we believe , looking at the information provided by investigators , that jan ullrich is implicated in the spanish doping affair , " t-mobile spokesman christian frommert added .
" however ullrich has not returned a positive doping test . " despite rumors of a meeting between the former olympic champion and t-mobile officials in a bid for reconciliation , ullrich 's future in cycling remains in doubt . a career of awards and controversy his suspension from cycling will last as long as the investigation into his alleged involvement in the doping scandal .
if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .
any positive outcome in this latest doping scandal will over-shadow his entire career . if ullrich is to retire in ignominious circumstances , it will be a sadly fitting career end for a rider who would be remembered as the german cyclist of the century who could have achieved even more than he did . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cyclist jan ullrich sacked amid doping allegations former tour de france champion jan ullrich , excluded from this year 's race because of allegations of blood-doping , has been sacked by his t-mobile team .

shiite guerrillas responded with a new hail of rocket fire on israel 's third city of haifa , killing two people . streams of people , many waving white flags , are making a desperate trek from southern lebanon after israel ordered them to leave their homes , raising fears it was planning a large scale ground invasion . around 360 people have been killed in israel 's massive blitz against lebanon which was launched after the capture of two soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas in a deadly border attack on july 12 .
a total of 37 israelis have died . syria to intervene if israel invades syria , blamed by the united states for stoking the conflict , warned that if israel invaded lebanon it would have no choice but to respond .
" if israel makes a land entry into lebanon , they can get to within 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- of damascus , " information minister moshen bilal told the spanish newspaper abc . " what will we do ?
stand by with our arms folded ?
absolutely not .
without any doubt syria will intervene in the conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incursions into lebanon have hit strategic sights israel , which has called up thousands of reserve soldiers nd massed its troops on the border , seized control of the strategic hilltop village of marun al-ras on saturday after sending tanks , bulldozers and armored cars rolling across the border . an unarmed un military observer was seriously wounded in an exchange of fire in the village sunday .
the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- said initial reports suggested hezbollah fire was responsible . ground assault " no invasion " defense minister amir peretz insisted israel did not plan a wide scale invasion .
" the ground operation is focusing on a limited entry of forces , " he told the cabinet .
" we are not dealing with an invasion of lebanon . " but his reassurances failed to stop mounting international criticism of the israeli offensive , which has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . " the whole thing has to stop .
it 's no natural disaster but a man-made crisis .
this is a senseless war , " un relief coordinator jan egeland said . he was in beirut to launch an appeal for millions of dollars in aid to help the half million civilians displaced in what the united nations says is a " catastrophic " humanitarian situation . britain belatedly joins chorus of disapproval even close us ally britain , which had drawn arab anger for declining to back un calls for an immediate ceasefire , stepped up its criticism of the israeli offensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain criticized israel 's targeting tactics " these are not surgical strikes .
it 's very difficult to understand the kind of military tactics that are being used , " junior foreign office minister kim howells said in beirut .
" if they are chasing hezbollah , then go for hezbollah .
you do n't go for the entire lebanese nation .
i very much hope that the americans understand what 's happening to lebanon - the destruction of the infrastructure , the death of so many children and so many people . " bush repeats belief in self-defense but us president george w. bush maintained his backing for israel 's campaign as rice prepared travel to the region in search of what she described as a long-term solution . " i believe sovereign nations have the right to defend their people from terrorist attack , and to take the necessary action to prevent those attacks , " bush said in his weekly radio address . israeli justice minister haim ramon said the aim of the offensive was to keep hezbollah - which controls southern lebanon in the absence of the regular lebanese army - at least 20 kilometers -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- from the frontier .
" for israel , there are no longer civilians in southern lebanon , " he warned . lebanon 's parliament speaker nabih berri - a close hezbollah ally - said the militant group was ready for the lebanese government to negotiate on its behalf through a third party for an exchange of prisoners with israel . prisoner swaps not on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is fighting on two fronts as raids on gaza continue israel has so far ruled out any swap either for the two soldiers held by hezbollah or another serviceman who was captured last month by palestinian militants in the gaza strip , triggering a similar offensive . israel said it opened an 80-kilometre by eight-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile by five-mile -rrb- safe passage to beirut for ships and aircraft , a humanitarian corridor to allow aid to the lebanese . israel 's air and sea blockade put lebanon 's only international airport out of action , and the bombing of houses , roads , bridges , factories , warehouses and trucks has created scenes reminiscent of the 1975-1990 civil war . foreign governments have been forced to lay on a flotilla of ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice enters middle east arena with few friends for company us secretary of state condoleezza rice embarks on a high-stakes middle east mission sunday , with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies over the crisis .

a total of 37 israelis have died . syria to intervene if israel invades syria , blamed by the united states for stoking the conflict , warned that if israel invaded lebanon it would have no choice but to respond .
" if israel makes a land entry into lebanon , they can get to within 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- of damascus , " information minister moshen bilal told the spanish newspaper abc . " what will we do ?
stand by with our arms folded ?
absolutely not .
without any doubt syria will intervene in the conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incursions into lebanon have hit strategic sights israel , which has called up thousands of reserve soldiers nd massed its troops on the border , seized control of the strategic hilltop village of marun al-ras on saturday after sending tanks , bulldozers and armored cars rolling across the border . an unarmed un military observer was seriously wounded in an exchange of fire in the village sunday .
the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- said initial reports suggested hezbollah fire was responsible . ground assault " no invasion " defense minister amir peretz insisted israel did not plan a wide scale invasion .
" the ground operation is focusing on a limited entry of forces , " he told the cabinet .
" we are not dealing with an invasion of lebanon . " but his reassurances failed to stop mounting international criticism of the israeli offensive , which has left lebanon virtually cut off from the world , made hundreds of thousands refugees in their own country and destroyed billions of dollars of infrastructure . " the whole thing has to stop .
it 's no natural disaster but a man-made crisis .
this is a senseless war , " un relief coordinator jan egeland said . he was in beirut to launch an appeal for millions of dollars in aid to help the half million civilians displaced in what the united nations says is a " catastrophic " humanitarian situation . britain belatedly joins chorus of disapproval even close us ally britain , which had drawn arab anger for declining to back un calls for an immediate ceasefire , stepped up its criticism of the israeli offensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain criticized israel 's targeting tactics " these are not surgical strikes .
it 's very difficult to understand the kind of military tactics that are being used , " junior foreign office minister kim howells said in beirut .
" if they are chasing hezbollah , then go for hezbollah .
you do n't go for the entire lebanese nation .
i very much hope that the americans understand what 's happening to lebanon - the destruction of the infrastructure , the death of so many children and so many people . " bush repeats belief in self-defense but us president george w. bush maintained his backing for israel 's campaign as rice prepared travel to the region in search of what she described as a long-term solution . " i believe sovereign nations have the right to defend their people from terrorist attack , and to take the necessary action to prevent those attacks , " bush said in his weekly radio address . israeli justice minister haim ramon said the aim of the offensive was to keep hezbollah - which controls southern lebanon in the absence of the regular lebanese army - at least 20 kilometers -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- from the frontier .
" for israel , there are no longer civilians in southern lebanon , " he warned . lebanon 's parliament speaker nabih berri - a close hezbollah ally - said the militant group was ready for the lebanese government to negotiate on its behalf through a third party for an exchange of prisoners with israel . prisoner swaps not on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is fighting on two fronts as raids on gaza continue israel has so far ruled out any swap either for the two soldiers held by hezbollah or another serviceman who was captured last month by palestinian militants in the gaza strip , triggering a similar offensive . israel said it opened an 80-kilometre by eight-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile by five-mile -rrb- safe passage to beirut for ships and aircraft , a humanitarian corridor to allow aid to the lebanese . israel 's air and sea blockade put lebanon 's only international airport out of action , and the bombing of houses , roads , bridges , factories , warehouses and trucks has created scenes reminiscent of the 1975-1990 civil war . foreign governments have been forced to lay on a flotilla of ferries , warships and cruise liners to evacuate stranded nationals , mainly to the nearby resort island of cyprus which has been battling to find temporary accommodation and flights for the estimated 70,000 evacuees at peak summer holiday season . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice enters middle east arena with few friends for company us secretary of state condoleezza rice embarks on a high-stakes middle east mission sunday , with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies over the crisis .

the iraq war caused a diplomatic rift between the us and its allies in ' old europe ' and between european nations themselves that has only recently healed .

jan ullrich feels betrayed and out of love with cycling jan ullrich could have taken his leave from cycling with his head held high , knowing he was the first german to win the tour de france .
but if he retires now , it will be under the familiar shadow of controversy . jan ullrich must have watched the final stages of the tour de france sunday with a bitter taste in his mouth .
just a day before the tour 's start , the 1997 winner was suspended by his t-mobile team along with spaniard oscar sevilla when new evidence from investigators in spain implicated them further in an ongoing doping scandal . without ullrich , t-mobile claimed three stages wins , one for matthias kessler and two for serhiy honchar , a podium place in the general classification as well as winning the teams ' classification .
with the german , the first from his country to win the tour de france , they may have been celebrating a yellow jersey victory on the champs elysees on sunday . andreas klöden , who finished as runner-up to lance armstrong in 2004 and took third this year behind overall winner floyd landis , paid tribute to his estranged team-mate and countryman , saying t-mobile could have achieved greater things with ullrich in the team . " we fought till the end for jan ullrich , so he can be proud of us , " said klöden , who maintained that team officials were wrong to suspend their leader .
" with jan here , we would have won the tour this year .
jan was innocent .
i know him .
he 's a good friend of mine .
i find it hard to understand why he should have to prove his innocence . " ullrich clearly struggles to understand this too , reiterating that he has n't been charged - or found guilty - of anything . " in a country governed by law , not only i but every individual is innocent until proven guilty , " ullrich said in a statement posted on his web site . former champion sacked by fax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich called the manner of his dismissal " unacceptable " t-mobile sacked ullrich and sevilla when both riders failed to respond to an ultimatum : prove you are not linked to the ongoing doping affair .
ullrich was fired from the team by fax , a form of dismissal the german rider called " unacceptable . " " i am very disappointed that this decision was not communicated to me personally , but that it was faxed to my lawyers , " ullrich said .
the 32-year-old rider had been under contract with t-mobile until the end of the year .
" i find it shameful that after so many years of a good and fruitful working relationship and after all that i have done for the team , i am merely sent a fax . " t-mobile general manager olaf ludwig said at the time : " jan was suspended and has not provided proof of his innocence , contrary to what he announced .
dismissal was the logical outcome . " no positive test or proof of innocence " for us it 's not a witch-hunt .
jan will always be the first ever german to win the tour de france , but at the same time we are not saying that he was doped .
however we have no proof of his innocence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doping investigation continues " we made this decision because we believe , looking at the information provided by investigators , that jan ullrich is implicated in the spanish doping affair , " t-mobile spokesman christian frommert added .
" however ullrich has not returned a positive doping test . " despite rumors of a meeting between the former olympic champion and t-mobile officials in a bid for reconciliation , ullrich 's future in cycling remains in doubt . a career of awards and controversy his suspension from cycling will last as long as the investigation into his alleged involvement in the doping scandal .
if found guilty , a longer ban will be handed down and given the 32-year-old ullrich 's age , his proneness to injury and growing disillusionment with the sport , he may have contested his last tour . this doping scandal may prove to be the final straw for a rider who has always offset his achievements with controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich hit many heights such as winning the 1997 tour ullrich 's collection of accolades - tour winner in 1997 , olympic gold in the road race at the 2000 games and several others world titles - will always be remembered alongside his highly publicized battles with weight problems , a drunken driving incident and a positive doping test in 2002 after ingesting two ecstasy pills .
any positive outcome in this latest doping scandal will over-shadow his entire career . if ullrich is to retire in ignominious circumstances , it will be a sadly fitting career end for a rider who would be remembered as the german cyclist of the century who could have achieved even more than he did . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cyclist jan ullrich sacked amid doping allegations former tour de france champion jan ullrich , excluded from this year 's race because of allegations of blood-doping , has been sacked by his t-mobile team .

however , the eu said unspecified " subsequent steps " involving human embryonic stem cells would not be included in the ban and would be eligible for funding . " the financing ... from eu funds is possible , but subject to very tight ethical rules and procedures , " said jukka pekkarinen , head of the finance ministry 's economics department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan eight countries - germany , austria , poland , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania luxembourg and malta - were looking to block funding for all embryonic stem cell research . but with the 51 billion euros -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- 2007-2013 financial package for science funding waiting for the green light , eu ministers were forced to compromise to keep large , long-term projects operating into next year without disruption . until monday , the eight countries insisted the common eu budget should not be used for activities banned in some member states , despite the argument that such research could be crucial in finding cures for chronic diseases such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
germany led the call for a ban germany had been at the forefront of the call for a total ban before changing its stance in the final hours of the ministers ' meeting .
german research minister annette schavan sent a letter last week to the eu presidency condemning the idea of eu cash being used for stem cell research . # b # " the european union science program should not be used to give financial incentives to kill embryos , " she wrote before the meeting .
" the current proposal from the european commission and the european parliament does not rule this out . " italy , luxembourg and slovenia joined germany in dropped their objections to the funding , while poland , lithuania , malta , slovakia and austria refused to sign on to the agreement . the eu found itself in a similar disagreement over genetic-related research before it adopted its science funding package for 2000-2006 .
the outcome of that discussion produced the current system of a case-by-case approach to stem cell-based projects which needs to pass several stages of national and eu ethical committees screening .
this type of research also can not be carried out in member states where it is banned by national legislation .
but opponents of the package insist this is not enough .
the controversial issue of stem cell research is a relatively minor one in terms of the total eu funding but it is viewed as a political and ideological bombshell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for eu-wide ban on stem cell research germany put pressure on a number of european countries to reject a proposal that would make eu money available for stem-cell research before a crucial vote on science funding takes place monday .

once it becomes an act , the legislation will give powers to the assembly to make laws in cardiff bay .
but , crucially , each time the assembly wants to create laws in a particular area of devolved power , it will be dependent on a special vote in both houses of parliament .
q : what will the assembly be able to do that it ca n't do at the moment ?
at the moment the assembly often faces frustration in waiting for parliament to find the time to make laws for wales .
let 's take a current example .
the assembly government is to set up an older people 's commissioner - a champion for pensioners ' rights .
the bill to establish the role is about to complete its passage through parliament after waiting in a queue .
under the new , streamlined system , the assembly will seek approval from westminster to draft the legislation itself - and then get on with the job .
q : but the assembly still wo n't be able to do everything it wants to ?
no .
it 'll only be able to make laws - or " assembly measures " as they 'll be known in areas for which it already has responsibility .
for example , health , education and tourism .
for example , it could n't create a bank holiday on st david 's day or legalise fox-hunting .
those issues will still be decided at westminster , although some ingenious ams may test the new system 's ability to challenge these issues .
q : how would the new system work ?
the assembly first minister will ask the welsh secretary for permission to legislate in a particular area .
if he says yes , and both houses of parliament agree , the major legislative work and scrutiny would then be transferred from london to cardiff bay .
q : could the assembly get full law-making powers like the scottish parliament ?
yes .
the government of wales bill does allow the assembly to hold a referendum on this , if two-thirds of ams want one .
in practice , that means labour has a veto on the referendum option .
should , for example , a conservative government at westminster be hostile to a labour-controlled assembly , then this route to full law-making powers might be taken .
q : does it change rhodri morgan 's status as the first minister ?
mr morgan has long styled himself first minister of the welsh assembly government , even though he is legally only the first secretary of the assembly 's executive committee .
the bill will give him his preferred status and formally separate the assembly government , the executive , from the assembly as a whole .
q : the uk government plans to use the act to change the electoral system .
why ?
in the last assembly election in clwyd west three of the four defeated candidates made it into the assembly .
they got it through the back door , under the highly complicated regional list system of proportional representation .
the uk government says that 's unfair and confusing .
welsh secretary peter hain claims it makes winners out of losers .
so the act would force would-be ams to choose one or other route next time .
opposition parties say this is rigging the system because as things stand it wo n't damage labour as much as other parties .
the government watchdog the electoral commission has also criticised the change .
q : will the uk government get its way ?
giving further powers to the assembly has been the most divisive issue in welsh labour politics , but the compromise on offer has pacified sceptical mps .
labour does n't have a majority in the house of lords so ministers expect a tough battle on their plans to change the electoral system .
q : what happens next ?
the bill is due to become law on tuesday when it gets royal assent .
the assembly will then assume its new powers after the elections in may 2007 .
q : and the queen gets a bigger role in welsh life ?
yes .
if you look at the small print today you 'll find that the first minister will in future be appointed by the queen on the nomination of the assembly , rather like the prime minister or scotland 's first minister .

a timid measure ... or the most extraordinary change since the act of union in 1536 ?
two recent descriptions of the government of wales bill , due to get royal assent on tuesday .
so which is right ?
given the piecemeal , incremental nature of welsh devolution it could of course be both .
the whole point of the new legislation is to give the welsh assembly much greater scope to pass laws for wales without having to go through parliament .
but first the welsh assembly government had to get it through parliament itself .
that meant winning over openly sceptical welsh labour mps .
so when he was at the despatch box in westminster , welsh secretary peter hain had to reassure them they would still be in charge .
and of course he was right .
parliament remains sovereign and can still stop the assembly in its tracks or even abolish it .
but when he 's in cardiff bay mr hain talks about a new dawn for devolution , the most significant transfer of power since the assembly opened for business in 1999 .
the precedure allows the assembly to take the initiative far more rhetoric maybe , but also containing a large dose of truth .
the explanation for this apparent paradox can be found in the complex procedure the new government of wales bill sets up .
the procedure allows the assembly to take the initiative far more .
the parliamentary stage is much faster and simpler .
and the end result will be to let the assembly pass its own laws or repeal laws passed at westminster .
those are all , in mr hain 's phrase , " significant transfers " of power .
but the procedure can only be triggered if he agrees .
mps and peers have to give their approval , and the areas in which the assembly can pass or repeal laws could be tightly restricted .
that 's how parliament remains " in charge . "
back of the queue say , for instance , the assembly government wants to make a law requiring gas , water and electricity companies provide services in welsh and english .
previously , that would have needed mps to hold three debates and do clause-by-clause examination of the bill .
then peers would have to do the same thing all over again .
the westminster government might well have more pressing concerns and be reluctant to give the issue all that parliamentary time .
so the bill would keep going to the back of the queue and might never see the light of day .
under the new procedure the assembly government will ask the secretary of state to lay an order before parliament giving the assembly power to make the new law .
mps would debate it only once , for 90 minutes , peers likewise .
assuming it was approved , the rest would be up to the assembly .
one mp described it as ' salami slicing power ' away from westminster , which is not a bad description depending on how broadly the order was drafted the assembly could then have power to make laws affecting large areas of language policy without ever having to go back to parliament .
in that way the assembly should gradually accumulate more and more freedom of action .
one mp described it as " salami slicing power " away from westminster , which is not a bad description .
what happens if parliament blocks the assembly 's wishes ?
that 's unlikely to happen .
the british constitution relies on conventions , in this case something called the salisbury convention .
that means parliament should n't block any manifesto commitment by a ruling party in the assembly .
but if it does , then the assembly has a nuclear option .
the government of wales bill allows it to hold a referendum on full-blown law-making powers for cardiff bay , provided two-thirds of ams agree .
since that effectively gives labour a veto on whether the referendum option should be used , it 's clearly aimed at a situation in which a conservative government at westminster stands in the way of a labour-controlled assembly .
there 's a growing sense of inevitability about full law-making powers , though maybe not for a good few years yet .
for now an extraordinary change , tinged with timidity .

express dairies , which is owned by arla foods , has 1,850 employees and distributes 390 million litres - 686 million pints - of milk annually .
the milk delivery business is in long-term decline - largely because of the low price of milk in supermarkets prompting customers to cancel their orders .

the firm has its own milk rounds business and says the combined group would have a 45 % market share and two million customers .
dairy crest , known for its clover , vitalite and utterly butterly brands , will buy two dairies at liverpool and nottingham and 77 distribution depots .
cost-savings were probable from the tie-up , dairy crest said .
express dairies , which is owned by arla foods , has 1,850 employees and distributes 390 million litres - 686 million pints - of milk annually .
the milk delivery business is in long-term decline - largely because of the low price of milk in supermarkets prompting customers to cancel their orders .
dairy crest chief executive drummond hall said this meant that merging the businesses made commercial sense .
" we will be able to prolong the life of these businesses by putting them together , " he said .
besides homes , express also delivers to retailers , wholesalers , schools and restaurants .
arla chief executive tim smith said : " in order for this sector to have a viable future , further consolidation of the industry was required . "

it has recommended taxotere as a post-surgery treatment for those who are in the early stages of disease .
a final version of the guidance is expected to be issued next month , following a consultation period .
if taxotere is routinely available in the uk it has the potential to prevent the deaths of hundreds of women with breast cancer each year dr david miles breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the uk - almost 42,000 women are diagnosed with the disease every year and one in nine women will develop it at some point in their lives .
however , survival rates for women with breast cancer have improved significantly over the last decade .
almost two thirds of women now diagnosed with breast cancer are likely to survive for at least 20 years .
impressive results taxotere , which is derived from yew trees , was approved for use in scotland by the scottish medicines consortium - the equivalent of nice - last october .

and at the end of nearly five years , 75 % of women were disease free , compared to 68 % on the standard therapy .
manufacturers sanofi-aventis said taxotere could save an extra six lives for every 100 patients treated .
the drug increased overall survival , disease-free survival and quality of life for women with early node-positive breast cancer , where cancerous cells had spread to the lymph nodes , a spokesman said .
dr david miles , consultant oncologist at london bridge hospital , said : " if taxotere is routinely available in the uk it has the potential to prevent the deaths of hundreds of women with breast cancer each year . "
he said nice 's guidance was " an important step forward for the treatment of early stage breast cancer in the uk " .
dr sarah rawlings , head of policy and information at cancer charity breakthrough breast cancer , also welcomed nice 's guidance .

at the train station , two figures are curled up in a doorway .
further into town , three more lie spent in the entrance of a closed clothes shop .
in front of the sports centre and the church , and anywhere else offering shade , small groups shelter from the sun , desperate for somewhere to recover from the exertions of the night before and prepare for those ahead .
the sun is one of the main reasons for coming to benicassim - but in mid-afternoon , to hide from it is the only option .

the entertainment continued well into the next morning , with music going until 0800 .
shady siesta so by the time the most spirited souls made it to bed , the sun was already starting to bake their tents again - making a shady siesta a top priority .
most fans abandoned the canvas during the day , leaving the sweltering campsites empty and quiet except for the few with shelters - and the constantly chattering insects .
cold outdoor showers in the campsites helped keep the heat at bay - and highlighted some cultural differences between nationalities .

spanish men had no qualms about baring all in the unisex al fresco washrooms - but most british blokes preferred to retain their trunks .
on the beach , meanwhile , spanish women could be identified by their apparent disdain for upper body clothing .
with the music not starting until the evening , the beach was the daytime destination for most festival-goers .
the long stretch of scorching sand may have been a bit of a trek from the campsites - but few festivals can offer a diversion as inviting as the mediterranean .
cold showers with so much spare time to spend under a parasol or in the sea , the weekend felt as much like a beach holiday as a music festival .
and those cold showers came in handy when trying to get rid of the benicassim body lotion - equal parts sweat , sea water , sun cream and sand .
the campsites were equipped with rows of outdoor unisex showers the town itself would be unremarkable if it were not for its beach and its new-found fame as host to some of the world 's biggest bands .
the festival takes over benicassim for five days .

but when the sun faded , the fans started to make their way to the festival arena .
compact festival the compact site is no bigger than strictly necessary to fit in the fans and four stages .
that made it very easy to get around , but there was not much else to do if the music did not turn you on .
one popular pastime was standing in front of four large electric fans that had tubes blowing water into the air , while the tent housing the second stage - which turned into the dance tent after 2100 - cooled the crowd with a fine water spray from the roof .
water-spraying electric fans kept people cool the smaller stages attracted acts like babyshambles , rufus wainwright , the editors and the ordinary boys - as well as bands from spain and elsewhere .

the pixies ' set on friday even had to be stopped for half an hour when one of the barriers in front of the stage started to buckle .
maybe the local crowd was so enthusiastic because such global stars only come to town once a year .

at the train station , two figures are curled up in a doorway .
further into town , three more lie spent in the entrance of a closed clothes shop .
in front of the sports centre and the church , and anywhere else offering shade , small groups shelter from the sun , desperate for somewhere to recover from the exertions of the night before and prepare for those ahead .
the sun is one of the main reasons for coming to benicassim - but in mid-afternoon , to hide from it is the only option .
at this weekend 's festival internacional de benicassim , that meant the music did not begin until 1630 , with the first act on the main stage at 2100 .
the entertainment continued well into the next morning , with music going until 0800 .
shady siesta so by the time the most spirited souls made it to bed , the sun was already starting to bake their tents again - making a shady siesta a top priority .
most fans abandoned the canvas during the day , leaving the sweltering campsites empty and quiet except for the few with shelters - and the constantly chattering insects .
cold outdoor showers in the campsites helped keep the heat at bay - and highlighted some cultural differences between nationalities .

spanish men had no qualms about baring all in the unisex al fresco washrooms - but most british blokes preferred to retain their trunks .
on the beach , meanwhile , spanish women could be identified by their apparent disdain for upper body clothing .
with the music not starting until the evening , the beach was the daytime destination for most festival-goers .
the long stretch of scorching sand may have been a bit of a trek from the campsites - but few festivals can offer a diversion as inviting as the mediterranean .
cold showers with so much spare time to spend under a parasol or in the sea , the weekend felt as much like a beach holiday as a music festival .
and those cold showers came in handy when trying to get rid of the benicassim body lotion - equal parts sweat , sea water , sun cream and sand .
the campsites were equipped with rows of outdoor unisex showers the town itself would be unremarkable if it were not for its beach and its new-found fame as host to some of the world 's biggest bands .
the festival takes over benicassim for five days .
but because the town effectively becomes part of the festival , it can become engulfed by its temporary inhabitants .
every cashpoint had a constant queue , the pavement cafes were often packed and restaurants struggled to keep up with demand .
many only offered a slimmed-down festival menu to make the job easier .
but when the sun faded , the fans started to make their way to the festival arena .
compact festival the compact site is no bigger than strictly necessary to fit in the fans and four stages .
that made it very easy to get around , but there was not much else to do if the music did not turn you on .
one popular pastime was standing in front of four large electric fans that had tubes blowing water into the air , while the tent housing the second stage - which turned into the dance tent after 2100 - cooled the crowd with a fine water spray from the roof .
water-spraying electric fans kept people cool the smaller stages attracted acts like babyshambles , rufus wainwright , the editors and the ordinary boys - as well as bands from spain and elsewhere .
on the main green stage , all the stars were from the uk or us , with the pixies , scissor sisters , depeche mode and franz ferdinand all getting particularly frenzied receptions .
the pixies ' set on friday even had to be stopped for half an hour when one of the barriers in front of the stage started to buckle .
maybe the local crowd was so enthusiastic because such global stars only come to town once a year .
and perhaps the international contingent appreciated it more because they had made the extra effort to be there .
or maybe they were just raring to go after a day on the beach and a siesta in the shade .

the healthcare commission said senior managers put nhs targets above outbreak control and failed to follow advice .
two outbreaks of clostridium difficile at the aylesbury hospital resulted in at least 33 deaths , higher than the 12 previously thought .
the investigation was ordered by health secretary patricia hewitt .
the leadership of the trust compromised the safety of patients by failing to make the right decisions anna walker , healthcare commission cps : link href = " " id = " 5209558 " style = " rightarrow " > c. difficile cases up cases of c. difficile infection in patients aged 65 years and above increased by 17.2 % in england over the last year , from 44,107 in 2004 to 51,690 in 2005 , according to figures released by the health protection agency .
the bacterium usually cause diarrhoea but can lead to fevers or more serious infections .
the strain seen at stoke mandeville hospital was relatively unknown , and appeared to cause more serious infections than other types .
two outbreaks took place between october 2003 and june 2005 , and overall 334 patients were infected and at least 33 died in this period .
the death toll may have been as high as 65 .
did not follow advice the healthcare commission 's inquiry highlighted significant failings by the senior managers at the hospital , which forms part of the buckinghamshire hospitals nhs trust .
clostridium difficile the bacteria are naturally present in the intestine but kept under control by other bacteria antibiotics can kill some of these , allowing c.difficile to take hold overuse of antibiotics is linked to the infection 's rise c.difficile is not resistant to treatment , but some cases are difficult to treat the strain seen at stoke mandeville hospital is related to one which has emerged in the us and canada it said they failed to follow advice on stopping the spread of infection , even at the height of the outbreak , from infection control staff , clinicians , nurses , and the health protection agency .
the report added that the managers failed to learn lessons from the first outbreak of the bacterium .
it said they were too busy focusing on other areas , such as meeting government targets and finance control .
a major cause of the spread was because the hospital failed to isolate patients with the infection , and infected patients were also being moved from ward to ward .
investigators also criticised inadequate cleaning , poor layout in older wards , a lack of hand washing and poor training in infection control .
staff at the hospital told investigators they were " too rushed to answer call bells or change soiled sheets " .
patients and relatives complained to the commission about dirty wards and toilet areas .
recommendations anna walker , chief executive of the healthcare commission , said : " at stoke mandeville , the leadership of the trust compromised the safety of patients by failing to make the right decisions , even though they had the benefit of experience from the first outbreak .
they rejected the proper advice of their own experts .
" we fully recognise that these outbreaks are not easy to control .
but we also know that trusts can minimise the spread of infection so long as they follow established advice on infection control . "
in the wake of the outbreaks , the chief executive of the buckinghamshire hospitals nhs trust and chair of the trust 's board have left .
the healthcare commission has issued a series of recommendations , including : a review of criteria for transferring patients between wards a review of the way the board becomes aware of clinical risk ensuring wards are properly cleaned and infection control is prioritised .
the trust has 60 days to complete meet these objectives .
alan bedford , the newly appointed acting chief executive of the trust , said : " we are determined to learn everything we can from the report , and fully accept the healthcare commission 's recommendations that the outbreaks should have been handled better , and that there are organisational issues on which work is needed .

the mother-of-three , who was told she had terminal cancer six years ago , climbed the 11,312ft -lrb- 3,448m -rrb- monarch pass in the colorado rockies .
the 42-year-old , of rothwell , leeds , suffered from altitude sickness during the 95-minute climb .
she said she just felt relief at having reached the summit .
mrs tomlinson said : " trying to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated is very difficult , but it 's been good .
" we 've still got to go down , but that 's a mere hop , skip and jump compared to what we 've done . "
earlier she said the ride had been much tougher than she had imagined .
" so far the rockies have been easier than the mountains on nevada and utah but my legs are suffering from the constant climbing .
" i 'm still going although i 'm not quite sure how after some of the days . "
it did look as though the end was near as she finished the 86-mile stage in tears " mike tomlinson " it 's one day at a time at the moment .
it 's hard to believe that we 've already nearly cycled the distance from john o 'groats to lands end twice . "
mrs tomlinson , whose heart only functions at 49 % due to her intensive treatment regime , has suffered severe tiredness , nausea and nose bleeds as a result of altitude sickness during the climbs so far .
her husband mike , 45 , who is following her in a support vehicle with their nine-year-old son steven , said : " there have been times since the start when it has looked like the ride was over .
" on tuesday this week after nine consecutive gruelling days of massive climbs in extraordinary heat it did look as though the end was near as she finished the 86-mile stage in tears and hunched over her handlebars .
" since then she 's dug particularly deep and continued despite not being particularly well . "

the mother-of-three , who was told she had terminal cancer six years ago , climbed the 11,312ft -lrb- 3,448m -rrb- monarch pass in the colorado rockies .
the 42-year-old , of rothwell , leeds , suffered from altitude sickness during the 95-minute climb .
she said she just felt relief at having reached the summit .
mrs tomlinson said : " trying to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated is very difficult , but it 's been good .
" we 've still got to go down , but that 's a mere hop , skip and jump compared to what we 've done . "
earlier she said the ride had been much tougher than she had imagined .
" so far the rockies have been easier than the mountains on nevada and utah but my legs are suffering from the constant climbing .
" i 'm still going although i 'm not quite sure how after some of the days .

it 's hard to believe that we 've already nearly cycled the distance from john o 'groats to lands end twice . "
mrs tomlinson , whose heart only functions at 49 % due to her intensive treatment regime , has suffered severe tiredness , nausea and nose bleeds as a result of altitude sickness during the climbs so far .
her husband mike , 45 , who is following her in a support vehicle with their nine-year-old son steven , said : " there have been times since the start when it has looked like the ride was over .
" on tuesday this week after nine consecutive gruelling days of massive climbs in extraordinary heat it did look as though the end was near as she finished the 86-mile stage in tears and hunched over her handlebars .
" since then she 's dug particularly deep and continued despite not being particularly well . "
mrs tomlinson started her challenge in june with co-riders ryan bowd , 27 , of calgary , canada , and 40-year-old martyn hollingworth , of aviemore , in the scottish highlands .

her husband mike , 45 , who is following her in a support vehicle with their nine-year-old son steven , said : " there have been times since the start when it has looked like the ride was over .
" on tuesday this week after nine consecutive gruelling days of massive climbs in extraordinary heat it did look as though the end was near as she finished the 86-mile stage in tears and hunched over her handlebars .
" since then she 's dug particularly deep and continued despite not being particularly well . "
mrs tomlinson started her challenge in june with co-riders ryan bowd , 27 , of calgary , canada , and 40-year-old martyn hollingworth , of aviemore , in the scottish highlands .
the trio hope to finish in new york by september .

figures from the health protection agency show 51,690 cases were recorded among patients aged 65 and over .
the hpa said the increase was partly explained by better monitoring by nhs trusts - but warned the bug did also appear to be more common .
it said the nhs had more work to do to tackle the problem . "
some of these infections are the price we pay for advances in medicine " dr georgia duckworth outbreak managers cricitised quick guide : mrsa c. difficile is a common hospital-acquired infection which usually causes diarrhoea but can lead to fevers or more serious infections .
older people are particularly at risk , but the figures show that approximately around 13,000 cases were also recorded among younger patients .
almost 30 % of samples in 2005 were caused by c. difficile ribotype 027 , which has previously been associated with major outbreaks .
the hpa said there were concerns that 027 was linked to increased severity of symptoms and increased rates among younger people .
the latest figures also show cases of mrsa in england fell by 2.5 % to 3,517 in the six months ending march 2006 .
significant decreases were seen in london , the worst affected region , and yorkshire and the humber , while there was a continuing slight increase in the north west .
analysis showed that 25 % of patients with mrsa had the disease on admission to hospital .
encouraging signs dr georgia duckworth , from the hpa , said : " nationally the increase in c. difficile and limited decrease in mrsa cases indicate there is much work to be done , but today 's figures show some encouraging signs .

"
dr duckworth said it was important to remember that not all hospital-acquired infections were preventable .
" some of these infections are the price we pay for advances in medicine which allow patients to survive who would have been unlikely to survive their illness a few years ago . "
health minister andy burnham said new powers in the health act would be used to deal with organisations that consistently fail to follow good practice guidance designed to cut hospital infections .
he said : " some trusts have managed to reduce their rates of infection significantly proving that it is possible to get a grip on this problem with focus and good management but elsewhere progress is not good enough and needs to improve .
" clean , safe care is not an optional extra .
we and the healthcare commission will not shy away from using the powers in the health act to ensure that trusts do everything possible to eradicate avoidable infection . "
targets blamed andrew lansley , the shadow health secretary , blamed government targets for rising rates of c. difficile infection by diverting staff focus to other areas .

" it is unacceptable that patient safety has been compromised by government targets and their financial mismanagement of our nhs . "
steve webb , for the liberal democrats , said it was tough to implement effective infection control measures when hospitals were constantly running near full capacity .
" it is damning that the shunting of patients from ward to ward to meet the government 's waiting time targets means infections are not isolated at an early stage . "
other figures published by the hpa show that 1,054 orthopaedic patients in england were recorded as picking up an infection in their surgical wound between april 2004 and december 2005 - an overall infection rate of 1.34 % .
infection rates were low for most surgical procedures , for instance 0.7 % in knee replacements .
they were highest for hip hemiarthroplasties -lrb- 3.9 % -rrb- , usually undertaken to repair fractures to the neck of femur .
these patients tend to be older and have underlying illness which affects their susceptibility to infection .
