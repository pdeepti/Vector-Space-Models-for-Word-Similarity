it has now delayed going public until may 11 . air berlin , europe 's third-biggest discount airline , has extended the offer period for its initial public offering amid concerns about its profitability .
it was due to be floated on the frankfurt stock exchange friday .
shares will be available for purchase on may 10 and trading with them will start on may 11 instead of friday as had been planned .
air berlin announced on friday that 42.5 million shares would be sold for 11.50-14.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.52- $ 18.31 -rrb- each .
initially , the firm had planned to sell almost 50 million shares for 15-17.50 euros per share .
the company is expected to reap 225-284 million euros from the ipo .
concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .
" air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " said nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership in an interview with bloomerg.com. the aggressive nature of the airline 's push for a share listing ahead of this summer 's soccer world cup in germany was due to be a loud and deliberate declaration of intent that air berlin is ready to mix it up with its rivals in a battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . the german budget market is also a cut-throat and crowded sector and air berlin is locked in a tussle for customers with competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor . " we have earned the number three position and we would like at least to hold onto it , " chief executive joachim hunold told reporters when the flotation was announced in april . air berlin had 13.5 million passengers in 2005 , up 12.5 percent from the previous year .
this still put it a distant third behind ryanair with 33.4 million and easyjet with 30.3 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin hopes to increase its passenger figures the airline views a planned expansion program as the key to making up some distance on its main rivals in europe while consolidating its position in its domestic market . the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- , now delayed for six days , of almost 50 million shares is expected to net air berlin up to 870 million euros -lrb- $ 1.10 billion -rrb- . up to 20 million shares will come from air berlin 's current stakeholders and up to 23 million shares from a capital increase which is expected to come through shortly before the new floatation date on may 11 .
an additional 6.5 million shares may be issued through a potential over-allotment offering .
air berlin shareholders who are selling have agreed not to release or sell any further shares for a period of six months following the ipo . british i n vestors waiti n g as germa n s lame n t high share price according to a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g , the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain where major london-based investment firms had shown interest in the air berlin stock . however , german analysts have voiced the opinion that the expected share price of between 15 and 18 euros is too expensive .
" we believe the stock price is too high and will be unattractive for investors , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with financial experts metzler , told reuters . it is unclear what effect , if any , the delayed flotation and extended subscription period will have on the price of the shares . new pla n es a n d desti n atio n s await n ewly floated compa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airline is to boost its output with new planes according to the german dpa news agency , around 50 percent of the new capital will go toward 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent will be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent will be used to refinance debt .
" with the flotation , we are opening up new and attractive areas for potential growth , " chairman hunold said . the airline currently has a fleet of 56 short-haul aircraft and mainly operates direct flights from airports across germany to mediterranean destinations including mainland spain , the balearic islands , greece , turkey and north africa .
it intends to use the allotted expansion funds to branch out into the scandinavian and eastern european markets , as well as growing in spain and the northern uk . air berli n headi n g back i n to the black with profit forecast the ipo could be the start of better things for air berlin .
the airline revealed recently it had a 2005 net loss of 115.9 million euros up from 2.9 million in 2004 , but blamed the losses on one-time effects and fuel costs as it seeks to persuade investors to help fund its expansion plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company 's profile and profits are set to rise however , according to a report by analysts at commerzbank , air berlin is expected to return to the black this year on a 20 percent rise in turnover , with a possible net profit of 51 million euros posted this year .
the report forecasts that the rise in turnover will reach 86 million euros in 2007 . earnings before interest and tax are seen rising to 89 million euros this year from a loss of 5.5 million last year , with sales expected to grow to 1.46 billion euros from 1.22 billion in 2005 , the report showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air berlin to go public german budget airline air berlin has announced it plans to list on the stock exchange .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .
polenz said it was important for the un security council to keep demonstrating unity .
he urged a " softer " resolution on iran which would again have the backing of china and russia too , saying that this meant a resolution not involving any sanctions yet . iranian media reports said tehran had encouraged germany to play a greater mediating role in the conflict , but polenz said in berlin that germany was n't in a position to do so . " we are with the world , we are side by side with the us , britain , france , china , india , russia and all the others , " he said .
" together we are trying to convince the iranians to correct their nuclear program and give up their enrichment activities .
what we can do , with regard to bilateral agreements , is convince iran to change its policy . " a n ti-america n ism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad green party parliamentarian marie-luise beck , who accompanied polenz to iran , was shocked about the level of anti-americanism and said it was all the more important for the us administration to seek direct dialogue with iranian leaders on a settlement of the conflict . coming back from tehran , she said she 'd realized that the task ahead of the security council was a daunting one . " i had not realized how fixed this impression is that the us is against this country , " she said .

ministers have the answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospective germans will have to undergo language and citizenship classes after months of political wrangling , interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states have agreed on common standards governing language and citizenship courses for migrants applying for a german passport . a two-day conference of state interior ministers in garmisch-partenkirchen , southern germany , ended friday with a breakthrough on the tricky question of what criteria a migrant needs to fulfill in order to qualify for german citizenship .
the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .
they will include learning about the basic values and fundaments of the german constitution and state . mandatory citizenship classes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants immigrants to pay for citizenship courses themselves the german federal office for migrants and refugees will be entrusted with developing the content and concept of the citizenship courses .
applicants will have to pay for the courses themselves . beckstein stressed that migrants had to sincerely attend the citizenship class in order to get a german passport .
" there has to be successful participation , " beckstein said , adding that merely furnishing proof of attendance would n't suffice . beckstein also said that participants would n't necessarily have to sit a formal test at the end of the course , but rather that their acquired knowledge would be tested in other ways .
he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german . " exceptions are possible , particularly in the case of driving offences , but we do n't want criminals taking on german citizenship , " beckstein said . compromise is " good news " most agree that the compromise is a fair one . " i 'm very happy with the result .
successful integration will now be crowned with citizenship , " ralf stegner , interior minister of schleswig-holstein and a social democrat said . the cdu 's domestic policy expert told a german new channel that the agreement was " good news .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german . " exceptions are possible , particularly in the case of driving offences , but we do n't want criminals taking on german citizenship , " beckstein said . compromise is " good news " most agree that the compromise is a fair one . " i 'm very happy with the result .
successful integration will now be crowned with citizenship , " ralf stegner , interior minister of schleswig-holstein and a social democrat said . the cdu 's domestic policy expert told a german new channel that the agreement was " good news . " around 130,000 foreigners became german citizens last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de singing from the same hymn sheet but in a different language german politician hans-christian ströbele has a novel idea for bringing germany 's diverse cultures together : foreign language national anthems .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

ministers have the answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospective germans will have to undergo language and citizenship classes after months of political wrangling , interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states have agreed on common standards governing language and citizenship courses for migrants applying for a german passport . a two-day conference of state interior ministers in garmisch-partenkirchen , southern germany , ended friday with a breakthrough on the tricky question of what criteria a migrant needs to fulfill in order to qualify for german citizenship .
the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .
they will include learning about the basic values and fundaments of the german constitution and state . mandatory citizenship classes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants immigrants to pay for citizenship courses themselves the german federal office for migrants and refugees will be entrusted with developing the content and concept of the citizenship courses .
applicants will have to pay for the courses themselves . beckstein stressed that migrants had to sincerely attend the citizenship class in order to get a german passport .
" there has to be successful participation , " beckstein said , adding that merely furnishing proof of attendance would n't suffice . beckstein also said that participants would n't necessarily have to sit a formal test at the end of the course , but rather that their acquired knowledge would be tested in other ways .
he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german . " exceptions are possible , particularly in the case of driving offences , but we do n't want criminals taking on german citizenship , " beckstein said . compromise is " good news " most agree that the compromise is a fair one . " i 'm very happy with the result .
successful integration will now be crowned with citizenship , " ralf stegner , interior minister of schleswig-holstein and a social democrat said . the cdu 's domestic policy expert told a german new channel that the agreement was " good news .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .
polenz said it was important for the un security council to keep demonstrating unity .
he urged a " softer " resolution on iran which would again have the backing of china and russia too , saying that this meant a resolution not involving any sanctions yet . iranian media reports said tehran had encouraged germany to play a greater mediating role in the conflict , but polenz said in berlin that germany was n't in a position to do so . " we are with the world , we are side by side with the us , britain , france , china , india , russia and all the others , " he said .
" together we are trying to convince the iranians to correct their nuclear program and give up their enrichment activities .
what we can do , with regard to bilateral agreements , is convince iran to change its policy . " a n ti-america n ism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad green party parliamentarian marie-luise beck , who accompanied polenz to iran , was shocked about the level of anti-americanism and said it was all the more important for the us administration to seek direct dialogue with iranian leaders on a settlement of the conflict . coming back from tehran , she said she 'd realized that the task ahead of the security council was a daunting one . " i had not realized how fixed this impression is that the us is against this country , " she said .
and if they give you this feeling , even if they 're wrong in a rational sense , you have to take that feeling seriously . " security co n cer n s iranian leaders have meanwhile voiced concern that there might be plots to attack their national football side during the world cup in germany , starting in june .
they feel threatened by the best-known iranian resistance group , the people 's mujaheddin , who are on the eu 's list of terrorist organizations . security problems are also expected in connection with a possible visit of the iranian president to germany during the world cup . but bavaria 's interior minister , günter beckstein , has already signaled that mahmud ahmadinedshad would not be welcome here after repeatedly denying the holocaust and calling for israel to be wiped off the map . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , merkel hold firm against iran nuclear program after meeting with us president george w. bush , german chancellor angela merkel said the us and germany were in " total agreement " on the need to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .

concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .
" air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " said nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership in an interview with bloomerg.com. the aggressive nature of the airline 's push for a share listing ahead of this summer 's soccer world cup in germany was due to be a loud and deliberate declaration of intent that air berlin is ready to mix it up with its rivals in a battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . the german budget market is also a cut-throat and crowded sector and air berlin is locked in a tussle for customers with competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .
polenz said it was important for the un security council to keep demonstrating unity .
he urged a " softer " resolution on iran which would again have the backing of china and russia too , saying that this meant a resolution not involving any sanctions yet . iranian media reports said tehran had encouraged germany to play a greater mediating role in the conflict , but polenz said in berlin that germany was n't in a position to do so . " we are with the world , we are side by side with the us , britain , france , china , india , russia and all the others , " he said .
" together we are trying to convince the iranians to correct their nuclear program and give up their enrichment activities .
what we can do , with regard to bilateral agreements , is convince iran to change its policy . " a n ti-america n ism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad green party parliamentarian marie-luise beck , who accompanied polenz to iran , was shocked about the level of anti-americanism and said it was all the more important for the us administration to seek direct dialogue with iranian leaders on a settlement of the conflict . coming back from tehran , she said she 'd realized that the task ahead of the security council was a daunting one . " i had not realized how fixed this impression is that the us is against this country , " she said .
and if they give you this feeling , even if they 're wrong in a rational sense , you have to take that feeling seriously . " security co n cer n s iranian leaders have meanwhile voiced concern that there might be plots to attack their national football side during the world cup in germany , starting in june .
they feel threatened by the best-known iranian resistance group , the people 's mujaheddin , who are on the eu 's list of terrorist organizations . security problems are also expected in connection with a possible visit of the iranian president to germany during the world cup . but bavaria 's interior minister , günter beckstein , has already signaled that mahmud ahmadinedshad would not be welcome here after repeatedly denying the holocaust and calling for israel to be wiped off the map . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , merkel hold firm against iran nuclear program after meeting with us president george w. bush , german chancellor angela merkel said the us and germany were in " total agreement " on the need to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .

ministers have the answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospective germans will have to undergo language and citizenship classes after months of political wrangling , interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states have agreed on common standards governing language and citizenship courses for migrants applying for a german passport . a two-day conference of state interior ministers in garmisch-partenkirchen , southern germany , ended friday with a breakthrough on the tricky question of what criteria a migrant needs to fulfill in order to qualify for german citizenship .
the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .
they will include learning about the basic values and fundaments of the german constitution and state . mandatory citizenship classes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants immigrants to pay for citizenship courses themselves the german federal office for migrants and refugees will be entrusted with developing the content and concept of the citizenship courses .
applicants will have to pay for the courses themselves . beckstein stressed that migrants had to sincerely attend the citizenship class in order to get a german passport .
" there has to be successful participation , " beckstein said , adding that merely furnishing proof of attendance would n't suffice . beckstein also said that participants would n't necessarily have to sit a formal test at the end of the course , but rather that their acquired knowledge would be tested in other ways .
he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german . " exceptions are possible , particularly in the case of driving offences , but we do n't want criminals taking on german citizenship , " beckstein said . compromise is " good news " most agree that the compromise is a fair one . " i 'm very happy with the result .
successful integration will now be crowned with citizenship , " ralf stegner , interior minister of schleswig-holstein and a social democrat said . the cdu 's domestic policy expert told a german new channel that the agreement was " good news .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .
polenz said it was important for the un security council to keep demonstrating unity .
he urged a " softer " resolution on iran which would again have the backing of china and russia too , saying that this meant a resolution not involving any sanctions yet . iranian media reports said tehran had encouraged germany to play a greater mediating role in the conflict , but polenz said in berlin that germany was n't in a position to do so . " we are with the world , we are side by side with the us , britain , france , china , india , russia and all the others , " he said .
" together we are trying to convince the iranians to correct their nuclear program and give up their enrichment activities .
what we can do , with regard to bilateral agreements , is convince iran to change its policy . " a n ti-america n ism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad green party parliamentarian marie-luise beck , who accompanied polenz to iran , was shocked about the level of anti-americanism and said it was all the more important for the us administration to seek direct dialogue with iranian leaders on a settlement of the conflict . coming back from tehran , she said she 'd realized that the task ahead of the security council was a daunting one . " i had not realized how fixed this impression is that the us is against this country , " she said .
and if they give you this feeling , even if they 're wrong in a rational sense , you have to take that feeling seriously . " security co n cer n s iranian leaders have meanwhile voiced concern that there might be plots to attack their national football side during the world cup in germany , starting in june .
they feel threatened by the best-known iranian resistance group , the people 's mujaheddin , who are on the eu 's list of terrorist organizations . security problems are also expected in connection with a possible visit of the iranian president to germany during the world cup . but bavaria 's interior minister , günter beckstein , has already signaled that mahmud ahmadinedshad would not be welcome here after repeatedly denying the holocaust and calling for israel to be wiped off the map . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , merkel hold firm against iran nuclear program after meeting with us president george w. bush , german chancellor angela merkel said the us and germany were in " total agreement " on the need to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .

it has now delayed going public until may 11 . air berlin , europe 's third-biggest discount airline , has extended the offer period for its initial public offering amid concerns about its profitability .
it was due to be floated on the frankfurt stock exchange friday .
shares will be available for purchase on may 10 and trading with them will start on may 11 instead of friday as had been planned .
air berlin announced on friday that 42.5 million shares would be sold for 11.50-14.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.52- $ 18.31 -rrb- each .
initially , the firm had planned to sell almost 50 million shares for 15-17.50 euros per share .
the company is expected to reap 225-284 million euros from the ipo .
concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .
" air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " said nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership in an interview with bloomerg.com. the aggressive nature of the airline 's push for a share listing ahead of this summer 's soccer world cup in germany was due to be a loud and deliberate declaration of intent that air berlin is ready to mix it up with its rivals in a battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . the german budget market is also a cut-throat and crowded sector and air berlin is locked in a tussle for customers with competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor . " we have earned the number three position and we would like at least to hold onto it , " chief executive joachim hunold told reporters when the flotation was announced in april . air berlin had 13.5 million passengers in 2005 , up 12.5 percent from the previous year .
this still put it a distant third behind ryanair with 33.4 million and easyjet with 30.3 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin hopes to increase its passenger figures the airline views a planned expansion program as the key to making up some distance on its main rivals in europe while consolidating its position in its domestic market . the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- , now delayed for six days , of almost 50 million shares is expected to net air berlin up to 870 million euros -lrb- $ 1.10 billion -rrb- . up to 20 million shares will come from air berlin 's current stakeholders and up to 23 million shares from a capital increase which is expected to come through shortly before the new floatation date on may 11 .
an additional 6.5 million shares may be issued through a potential over-allotment offering .
air berlin shareholders who are selling have agreed not to release or sell any further shares for a period of six months following the ipo . british i n vestors waiti n g as germa n s lame n t high share price according to a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g , the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain where major london-based investment firms had shown interest in the air berlin stock . however , german analysts have voiced the opinion that the expected share price of between 15 and 18 euros is too expensive .
" we believe the stock price is too high and will be unattractive for investors , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with financial experts metzler , told reuters . it is unclear what effect , if any , the delayed flotation and extended subscription period will have on the price of the shares . new pla n es a n d desti n atio n s await n ewly floated compa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airline is to boost its output with new planes according to the german dpa news agency , around 50 percent of the new capital will go toward 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent will be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent will be used to refinance debt .
" with the flotation , we are opening up new and attractive areas for potential growth , " chairman hunold said . the airline currently has a fleet of 56 short-haul aircraft and mainly operates direct flights from airports across germany to mediterranean destinations including mainland spain , the balearic islands , greece , turkey and north africa .
it intends to use the allotted expansion funds to branch out into the scandinavian and eastern european markets , as well as growing in spain and the northern uk . air berli n headi n g back i n to the black with profit forecast the ipo could be the start of better things for air berlin .
the airline revealed recently it had a 2005 net loss of 115.9 million euros up from 2.9 million in 2004 , but blamed the losses on one-time effects and fuel costs as it seeks to persuade investors to help fund its expansion plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company 's profile and profits are set to rise however , according to a report by analysts at commerzbank , air berlin is expected to return to the black this year on a 20 percent rise in turnover , with a possible net profit of 51 million euros posted this year .
the report forecasts that the rise in turnover will reach 86 million euros in 2007 . earnings before interest and tax are seen rising to 89 million euros this year from a loss of 5.5 million last year , with sales expected to grow to 1.46 billion euros from 1.22 billion in 2005 , the report showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air berlin to go public german budget airline air berlin has announced it plans to list on the stock exchange .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

ministers have the answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospective germans will have to undergo language and citizenship classes after months of political wrangling , interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states have agreed on common standards governing language and citizenship courses for migrants applying for a german passport . a two-day conference of state interior ministers in garmisch-partenkirchen , southern germany , ended friday with a breakthrough on the tricky question of what criteria a migrant needs to fulfill in order to qualify for german citizenship .
the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .
they will include learning about the basic values and fundaments of the german constitution and state . mandatory citizenship classes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants immigrants to pay for citizenship courses themselves the german federal office for migrants and refugees will be entrusted with developing the content and concept of the citizenship courses .
applicants will have to pay for the courses themselves . beckstein stressed that migrants had to sincerely attend the citizenship class in order to get a german passport .
" there has to be successful participation , " beckstein said , adding that merely furnishing proof of attendance would n't suffice . beckstein also said that participants would n't necessarily have to sit a formal test at the end of the course , but rather that their acquired knowledge would be tested in other ways .
he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german . " exceptions are possible , particularly in the case of driving offences , but we do n't want criminals taking on german citizenship , " beckstein said . compromise is " good news " most agree that the compromise is a fair one . " i 'm very happy with the result .

it has now delayed going public until may 11 . air berlin , europe 's third-biggest discount airline , has extended the offer period for its initial public offering amid concerns about its profitability .
it was due to be floated on the frankfurt stock exchange friday .
shares will be available for purchase on may 10 and trading with them will start on may 11 instead of friday as had been planned .
air berlin announced on friday that 42.5 million shares would be sold for 11.50-14.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.52- $ 18.31 -rrb- each .
initially , the firm had planned to sell almost 50 million shares for 15-17.50 euros per share .
the company is expected to reap 225-284 million euros from the ipo .
concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .
" air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " said nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership in an interview with bloomerg.com. the aggressive nature of the airline 's push for a share listing ahead of this summer 's soccer world cup in germany was due to be a loud and deliberate declaration of intent that air berlin is ready to mix it up with its rivals in a battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . the german budget market is also a cut-throat and crowded sector and air berlin is locked in a tussle for customers with competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor . " we have earned the number three position and we would like at least to hold onto it , " chief executive joachim hunold told reporters when the flotation was announced in april . air berlin had 13.5 million passengers in 2005 , up 12.5 percent from the previous year .
this still put it a distant third behind ryanair with 33.4 million and easyjet with 30.3 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin hopes to increase its passenger figures the airline views a planned expansion program as the key to making up some distance on its main rivals in europe while consolidating its position in its domestic market . the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- , now delayed for six days , of almost 50 million shares is expected to net air berlin up to 870 million euros -lrb- $ 1.10 billion -rrb- . up to 20 million shares will come from air berlin 's current stakeholders and up to 23 million shares from a capital increase which is expected to come through shortly before the new floatation date on may 11 .
an additional 6.5 million shares may be issued through a potential over-allotment offering .
air berlin shareholders who are selling have agreed not to release or sell any further shares for a period of six months following the ipo . british i n vestors waiti n g as germa n s lame n t high share price according to a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g , the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain where major london-based investment firms had shown interest in the air berlin stock . however , german analysts have voiced the opinion that the expected share price of between 15 and 18 euros is too expensive .
" we believe the stock price is too high and will be unattractive for investors , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with financial experts metzler , told reuters . it is unclear what effect , if any , the delayed flotation and extended subscription period will have on the price of the shares . new pla n es a n d desti n atio n s await n ewly floated compa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airline is to boost its output with new planes according to the german dpa news agency , around 50 percent of the new capital will go toward 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent will be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent will be used to refinance debt .
" with the flotation , we are opening up new and attractive areas for potential growth , " chairman hunold said . the airline currently has a fleet of 56 short-haul aircraft and mainly operates direct flights from airports across germany to mediterranean destinations including mainland spain , the balearic islands , greece , turkey and north africa .
it intends to use the allotted expansion funds to branch out into the scandinavian and eastern european markets , as well as growing in spain and the northern uk . air berli n headi n g back i n to the black with profit forecast the ipo could be the start of better things for air berlin .
the airline revealed recently it had a 2005 net loss of 115.9 million euros up from 2.9 million in 2004 , but blamed the losses on one-time effects and fuel costs as it seeks to persuade investors to help fund its expansion plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company 's profile and profits are set to rise however , according to a report by analysts at commerzbank , air berlin is expected to return to the black this year on a 20 percent rise in turnover , with a possible net profit of 51 million euros posted this year .
the report forecasts that the rise in turnover will reach 86 million euros in 2007 . earnings before interest and tax are seen rising to 89 million euros this year from a loss of 5.5 million last year , with sales expected to grow to 1.46 billion euros from 1.22 billion in 2005 , the report showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air berlin to go public german budget airline air berlin has announced it plans to list on the stock exchange .

ministers have the answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospective germans will have to undergo language and citizenship classes after months of political wrangling , interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states have agreed on common standards governing language and citizenship courses for migrants applying for a german passport . a two-day conference of state interior ministers in garmisch-partenkirchen , southern germany , ended friday with a breakthrough on the tricky question of what criteria a migrant needs to fulfill in order to qualify for german citizenship .
the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .
they will include learning about the basic values and fundaments of the german constitution and state . mandatory citizenship classes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants immigrants to pay for citizenship courses themselves the german federal office for migrants and refugees will be entrusted with developing the content and concept of the citizenship courses .
applicants will have to pay for the courses themselves . beckstein stressed that migrants had to sincerely attend the citizenship class in order to get a german passport .
" there has to be successful participation , " beckstein said , adding that merely furnishing proof of attendance would n't suffice . beckstein also said that participants would n't necessarily have to sit a formal test at the end of the course , but rather that their acquired knowledge would be tested in other ways .
he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german . " exceptions are possible , particularly in the case of driving offences , but we do n't want criminals taking on german citizenship , " beckstein said . compromise is " good news " most agree that the compromise is a fair one . " i 'm very happy with the result .
successful integration will now be crowned with citizenship , " ralf stegner , interior minister of schleswig-holstein and a social democrat said . the cdu 's domestic policy expert told a german new channel that the agreement was " good news . " around 130,000 foreigners became german citizens last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de singing from the same hymn sheet but in a different language german politician hans-christian ströbele has a novel idea for bringing germany 's diverse cultures together : foreign language national anthems .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .

he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .

ministers have the answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospective germans will have to undergo language and citizenship classes after months of political wrangling , interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states have agreed on common standards governing language and citizenship courses for migrants applying for a german passport . a two-day conference of state interior ministers in garmisch-partenkirchen , southern germany , ended friday with a breakthrough on the tricky question of what criteria a migrant needs to fulfill in order to qualify for german citizenship .
the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .
they will include learning about the basic values and fundaments of the german constitution and state . mandatory citizenship classes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants immigrants to pay for citizenship courses themselves the german federal office for migrants and refugees will be entrusted with developing the content and concept of the citizenship courses .
applicants will have to pay for the courses themselves . beckstein stressed that migrants had to sincerely attend the citizenship class in order to get a german passport .
" there has to be successful participation , " beckstein said , adding that merely furnishing proof of attendance would n't suffice . beckstein also said that participants would n't necessarily have to sit a formal test at the end of the course , but rather that their acquired knowledge would be tested in other ways .
he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .
polenz said it was important for the un security council to keep demonstrating unity .
he urged a " softer " resolution on iran which would again have the backing of china and russia too , saying that this meant a resolution not involving any sanctions yet . iranian media reports said tehran had encouraged germany to play a greater mediating role in the conflict , but polenz said in berlin that germany was n't in a position to do so . " we are with the world , we are side by side with the us , britain , france , china , india , russia and all the others , " he said .
" together we are trying to convince the iranians to correct their nuclear program and give up their enrichment activities .
what we can do , with regard to bilateral agreements , is convince iran to change its policy . " a n ti-america n ism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad green party parliamentarian marie-luise beck , who accompanied polenz to iran , was shocked about the level of anti-americanism and said it was all the more important for the us administration to seek direct dialogue with iranian leaders on a settlement of the conflict . coming back from tehran , she said she 'd realized that the task ahead of the security council was a daunting one . " i had not realized how fixed this impression is that the us is against this country , " she said .
and if they give you this feeling , even if they 're wrong in a rational sense , you have to take that feeling seriously . " security co n cer n s iranian leaders have meanwhile voiced concern that there might be plots to attack their national football side during the world cup in germany , starting in june .
they feel threatened by the best-known iranian resistance group , the people 's mujaheddin , who are on the eu 's list of terrorist organizations . security problems are also expected in connection with a possible visit of the iranian president to germany during the world cup . but bavaria 's interior minister , günter beckstein , has already signaled that mahmud ahmadinedshad would not be welcome here after repeatedly denying the holocaust and calling for israel to be wiped off the map . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , merkel hold firm against iran nuclear program after meeting with us president george w. bush , german chancellor angela merkel said the us and germany were in " total agreement " on the need to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.05.2006 air berlin delays much anticipated flotation on stock exchange großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin 's expansion plans are ready for take-off as the airline goes public air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , was due to float on the frankfurt stock exchange friday in the company 's latest strategic move in the crowded low-cost market .
it has now delayed going public until may 11 . air berlin , europe 's third-biggest discount airline , has extended the offer period for its initial public offering amid concerns about its profitability .
it was due to be floated on the frankfurt stock exchange friday .
shares will be available for purchase on may 10 and trading with them will start on may 11 instead of friday as had been planned .
air berlin announced on friday that 42.5 million shares would be sold for 11.50-14.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.52- $ 18.31 -rrb- each .
initially , the firm had planned to sell almost 50 million shares for 15-17.50 euros per share .
the company is expected to reap 225-284 million euros from the ipo .
concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .
" air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " said nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership in an interview with bloomerg.com. the aggressive nature of the airline 's push for a share listing ahead of this summer 's soccer world cup in germany was due to be a loud and deliberate declaration of intent that air berlin is ready to mix it up with its rivals in a battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . the german budget market is also a cut-throat and crowded sector and air berlin is locked in a tussle for customers with competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor . " we have earned the number three position and we would like at least to hold onto it , " chief executive joachim hunold told reporters when the flotation was announced in april . air berlin had 13.5 million passengers in 2005 , up 12.5 percent from the previous year .
this still put it a distant third behind ryanair with 33.4 million and easyjet with 30.3 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin hopes to increase its passenger figures the airline views a planned expansion program as the key to making up some distance on its main rivals in europe while consolidating its position in its domestic market . the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- , now delayed for six days , of almost 50 million shares is expected to net air berlin up to 870 million euros -lrb- $ 1.10 billion -rrb- . up to 20 million shares will come from air berlin 's current stakeholders and up to 23 million shares from a capital increase which is expected to come through shortly before the new floatation date on may 11 .
an additional 6.5 million shares may be issued through a potential over-allotment offering .
air berlin shareholders who are selling have agreed not to release or sell any further shares for a period of six months following the ipo . british i n vestors waiti n g as germa n s lame n t high share price according to a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g , the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain where major london-based investment firms had shown interest in the air berlin stock . however , german analysts have voiced the opinion that the expected share price of between 15 and 18 euros is too expensive .
" we believe the stock price is too high and will be unattractive for investors , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with financial experts metzler , told reuters . it is unclear what effect , if any , the delayed flotation and extended subscription period will have on the price of the shares . new pla n es a n d desti n atio n s await n ewly floated compa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airline is to boost its output with new planes according to the german dpa news agency , around 50 percent of the new capital will go toward 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent will be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent will be used to refinance debt .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .
polenz said it was important for the un security council to keep demonstrating unity .
he urged a " softer " resolution on iran which would again have the backing of china and russia too , saying that this meant a resolution not involving any sanctions yet . iranian media reports said tehran had encouraged germany to play a greater mediating role in the conflict , but polenz said in berlin that germany was n't in a position to do so . " we are with the world , we are side by side with the us , britain , france , china , india , russia and all the others , " he said .
" together we are trying to convince the iranians to correct their nuclear program and give up their enrichment activities .
what we can do , with regard to bilateral agreements , is convince iran to change its policy . " a n ti-america n ism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad green party parliamentarian marie-luise beck , who accompanied polenz to iran , was shocked about the level of anti-americanism and said it was all the more important for the us administration to seek direct dialogue with iranian leaders on a settlement of the conflict . coming back from tehran , she said she 'd realized that the task ahead of the security council was a daunting one . " i had not realized how fixed this impression is that the us is against this country , " she said .
and if they give you this feeling , even if they 're wrong in a rational sense , you have to take that feeling seriously . " security co n cer n s iranian leaders have meanwhile voiced concern that there might be plots to attack their national football side during the world cup in germany , starting in june .
they feel threatened by the best-known iranian resistance group , the people 's mujaheddin , who are on the eu 's list of terrorist organizations . security problems are also expected in connection with a possible visit of the iranian president to germany during the world cup . but bavaria 's interior minister , günter beckstein , has already signaled that mahmud ahmadinedshad would not be welcome here after repeatedly denying the holocaust and calling for israel to be wiped off the map . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , merkel hold firm against iran nuclear program after meeting with us president george w. bush , german chancellor angela merkel said the us and germany were in " total agreement " on the need to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .

initially , the firm had planned to sell almost 50 million shares for 15-17.50 euros per share .
the company is expected to reap 225-284 million euros from the ipo .
concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .
" air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " said nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership in an interview with bloomerg.com. the aggressive nature of the airline 's push for a share listing ahead of this summer 's soccer world cup in germany was due to be a loud and deliberate declaration of intent that air berlin is ready to mix it up with its rivals in a battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . the german budget market is also a cut-throat and crowded sector and air berlin is locked in a tussle for customers with competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor .

an additional 6.5 million shares may be issued through a potential over-allotment offering .

" we believe the stock price is too high and will be unattractive for investors , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with financial experts metzler , told reuters . it is unclear what effect , if any , the delayed flotation and extended subscription period will have on the price of the shares . new pla n es a n d desti n atio n s await n ewly floated compa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airline is to boost its output with new planes according to the german dpa news agency , around 50 percent of the new capital will go toward 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent will be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent will be used to refinance debt .

concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .
polenz said it was important for the un security council to keep demonstrating unity .
he urged a " softer " resolution on iran which would again have the backing of china and russia too , saying that this meant a resolution not involving any sanctions yet . iranian media reports said tehran had encouraged germany to play a greater mediating role in the conflict , but polenz said in berlin that germany was n't in a position to do so . " we are with the world , we are side by side with the us , britain , france , china , india , russia and all the others , " he said .
" together we are trying to convince the iranians to correct their nuclear program and give up their enrichment activities .

" i had not realized how fixed this impression is that the us is against this country , " she said .
and if they give you this feeling , even if they 're wrong in a rational sense , you have to take that feeling seriously .

they feel threatened by the best-known iranian resistance group , the people 's mujaheddin , who are on the eu 's list of terrorist organizations . security problems are also expected in connection with a possible visit of the iranian president to germany during the world cup . but bavaria 's interior minister , günter beckstein , has already signaled that mahmud ahmadinedshad would not be welcome here after repeatedly denying the holocaust and calling for israel to be wiped off the map . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , merkel hold firm against iran nuclear program after meeting with us president george w. bush , german chancellor angela merkel said the us and germany were in " total agreement " on the need to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .

ministers have the answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospective germans will have to undergo language and citizenship classes after months of political wrangling , interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states have agreed on common standards governing language and citizenship courses for migrants applying for a german passport . a two-day conference of state interior ministers in garmisch-partenkirchen , southern germany , ended friday with a breakthrough on the tricky question of what criteria a migrant needs to fulfill in order to qualify for german citizenship .
the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .
they will include learning about the basic values and fundaments of the german constitution and state . mandatory citizenship classes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants immigrants to pay for citizenship courses themselves the german federal office for migrants and refugees will be entrusted with developing the content and concept of the citizenship courses .
applicants will have to pay for the courses themselves . beckstein stressed that migrants had to sincerely attend the citizenship class in order to get a german passport .
" there has to be successful participation , " beckstein said , adding that merely furnishing proof of attendance would n't suffice . beckstein also said that participants would n't necessarily have to sit a formal test at the end of the course , but rather that their acquired knowledge would be tested in other ways .
he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german . " exceptions are possible , particularly in the case of driving offences , but we do n't want criminals taking on german citizenship , " beckstein said . compromise is " good news " most agree that the compromise is a fair one . " i 'm very happy with the result .
successful integration will now be crowned with citizenship , " ralf stegner , interior minister of schleswig-holstein and a social democrat said . the cdu 's domestic policy expert told a german new channel that the agreement was " good news .

it has now delayed going public until may 11 . air berlin , europe 's third-biggest discount airline , has extended the offer period for its initial public offering amid concerns about its profitability .
it was due to be floated on the frankfurt stock exchange friday .
shares will be available for purchase on may 10 and trading with them will start on may 11 instead of friday as had been planned .
air berlin announced on friday that 42.5 million shares would be sold for 11.50-14.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.52- $ 18.31 -rrb- each .
initially , the firm had planned to sell almost 50 million shares for 15-17.50 euros per share .
the company is expected to reap 225-284 million euros from the ipo .
concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .
" air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " said nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership in an interview with bloomerg.com. the aggressive nature of the airline 's push for a share listing ahead of this summer 's soccer world cup in germany was due to be a loud and deliberate declaration of intent that air berlin is ready to mix it up with its rivals in a battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . the german budget market is also a cut-throat and crowded sector and air berlin is locked in a tussle for customers with competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor . " we have earned the number three position and we would like at least to hold onto it , " chief executive joachim hunold told reporters when the flotation was announced in april . air berlin had 13.5 million passengers in 2005 , up 12.5 percent from the previous year .
this still put it a distant third behind ryanair with 33.4 million and easyjet with 30.3 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin hopes to increase its passenger figures the airline views a planned expansion program as the key to making up some distance on its main rivals in europe while consolidating its position in its domestic market . the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- , now delayed for six days , of almost 50 million shares is expected to net air berlin up to 870 million euros -lrb- $ 1.10 billion -rrb- . up to 20 million shares will come from air berlin 's current stakeholders and up to 23 million shares from a capital increase which is expected to come through shortly before the new floatation date on may 11 .
an additional 6.5 million shares may be issued through a potential over-allotment offering .
air berlin shareholders who are selling have agreed not to release or sell any further shares for a period of six months following the ipo . british i n vestors waiti n g as germa n s lame n t high share price according to a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g , the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain where major london-based investment firms had shown interest in the air berlin stock . however , german analysts have voiced the opinion that the expected share price of between 15 and 18 euros is too expensive .
" we believe the stock price is too high and will be unattractive for investors , " jürgen pieper , an analyst with financial experts metzler , told reuters . it is unclear what effect , if any , the delayed flotation and extended subscription period will have on the price of the shares . new pla n es a n d desti n atio n s await n ewly floated compa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airline is to boost its output with new planes according to the german dpa news agency , around 50 percent of the new capital will go toward 55 recently ordered new airbus a320s , 40 percent will be invested to extend the current network and the remaining 10 percent will be used to refinance debt .
" with the flotation , we are opening up new and attractive areas for potential growth , " chairman hunold said . the airline currently has a fleet of 56 short-haul aircraft and mainly operates direct flights from airports across germany to mediterranean destinations including mainland spain , the balearic islands , greece , turkey and north africa .
it intends to use the allotted expansion funds to branch out into the scandinavian and eastern european markets , as well as growing in spain and the northern uk . air berli n headi n g back i n to the black with profit forecast the ipo could be the start of better things for air berlin .
the airline revealed recently it had a 2005 net loss of 115.9 million euros up from 2.9 million in 2004 , but blamed the losses on one-time effects and fuel costs as it seeks to persuade investors to help fund its expansion plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company 's profile and profits are set to rise however , according to a report by analysts at commerzbank , air berlin is expected to return to the black this year on a 20 percent rise in turnover , with a possible net profit of 51 million euros posted this year .
the report forecasts that the rise in turnover will reach 86 million euros in 2007 . earnings before interest and tax are seen rising to 89 million euros this year from a loss of 5.5 million last year , with sales expected to grow to 1.46 billion euros from 1.22 billion in 2005 , the report showed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air berlin to go public german budget airline air berlin has announced it plans to list on the stock exchange .

the company is expected to reap 225-284 million euros from the ipo .
concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .
" air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " said nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership in an interview with bloomerg.com. the aggressive nature of the airline 's push for a share listing ahead of this summer 's soccer world cup in germany was due to be a loud and deliberate declaration of intent that air berlin is ready to mix it up with its rivals in a battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . the german budget market is also a cut-throat and crowded sector and air berlin is locked in a tussle for customers with competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor .

an additional 6.5 million shares may be issued through a potential over-allotment offering .
air berlin shareholders who are selling have agreed not to release or sell any further shares for a period of six months following the ipo . british i n vestors waiti n g as germa n s lame n t high share price according to a report in the german financial publication börse n zeitu n g , the response during the subscription period which started on april 28 has been positive , particularly in britain where major london-based investment firms had shown interest in the air berlin stock . however , german analysts have voiced the opinion that the expected share price of between 15 and 18 euros is too expensive .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

two-day talks with political leaders in tehran helped gauge the leadership 's resistance towards suspending its uranium enrichment activities . the german mps were told that iran was by no means willing to abandon its nuclear program , as leaders there felt that the united states and the west as a whole had gambled away all trust in them by allegedly applying double standards . the visiting german mps met with high-ranking iranian politicians to discuss the most sensitive issues relating to tehran 's nuclear ambitions . during talks with the parliamentary president , the deputy foreign minister and many other leading political representatives , ruprecht polenz , the christian democrat head of germany 's parliamentary foreign affairs committee , urged his hosts to rethink their stance on the national nuclear program with uranium-enrichment activities now having gone into their second phase . cutti n g little ice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz polenz said the international community was expecting a sign of good will from tehran to promote a speedy solution to the conflict and save the country from any potential sanctions in case it kept reacting so stubbornly . talking to the media back home in berlin , polenz acknowledged that his delegation 's talks cut little ice with iranian leaders , who like to see themselves engaged in a fight between themselves and the united states and other western nations . the german mps were told that history had shown that westerners were unreliable and unpredictable and had no real understanding of iran 's own security interests in a region full of tension .
polenz said it was important for the un security council to keep demonstrating unity .
he urged a " softer " resolution on iran which would again have the backing of china and russia too , saying that this meant a resolution not involving any sanctions yet . iranian media reports said tehran had encouraged germany to play a greater mediating role in the conflict , but polenz said in berlin that germany was n't in a position to do so . " we are with the world , we are side by side with the us , britain , france , china , india , russia and all the others , " he said .

ministers have the answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospective germans will have to undergo language and citizenship classes after months of political wrangling , interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states have agreed on common standards governing language and citizenship courses for migrants applying for a german passport . a two-day conference of state interior ministers in garmisch-partenkirchen , southern germany , ended friday with a breakthrough on the tricky question of what criteria a migrant needs to fulfill in order to qualify for german citizenship .
the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .
they will include learning about the basic values and fundaments of the german constitution and state . mandatory citizenship classes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants immigrants to pay for citizenship courses themselves the german federal office for migrants and refugees will be entrusted with developing the content and concept of the citizenship courses .
applicants will have to pay for the courses themselves . beckstein stressed that migrants had to sincerely attend the citizenship class in order to get a german passport .
" there has to be successful participation , " beckstein said , adding that merely furnishing proof of attendance would n't suffice . beckstein also said that participants would n't necessarily have to sit a formal test at the end of the course , but rather that their acquired knowledge would be tested in other ways .
he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german . " exceptions are possible , particularly in the case of driving offences , but we do n't want criminals taking on german citizenship , " beckstein said . compromise is " good news " most agree that the compromise is a fair one . " i 'm very happy with the result .
successful integration will now be crowned with citizenship , " ralf stegner , interior minister of schleswig-holstein and a social democrat said . the cdu 's domestic policy expert told a german new channel that the agreement was " good news .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

in an interview with dw-world.de , dr. hans-joachim busch of the sigmund freud institute talked about how freud changed our understanding of the mind , and his relevance today . dw-world.de : sigmund freud 's theories were revolutionary in his time ; he 's considered the father of psychoanalysis .
what is his significance today ? hans-joachim busch : freud 's close exploration of the unconscious is the most significant contribution to our understanding of the mind .
through freud , we have become familiar with the unconscious and have increasingly learned to deal with it .
this is the case for both healthy individuals , as well as those with problems who are in therapy .
these are people who may not be mentally ill , but who follow unconscious motives , which could possibly have precarious results .
freud made this area accessible to us and we can therefore consider these matters in therapy . are freud 's theories still up to date ? absolutely !
his theories are for the most part still very current .
psychoanalysis could not even exist or be conceived without them .
the unconscious is the theoretical core of psychoanalysis .
everything else can be derived from it , or can be looked at in this respect , such as drive , sexuality and all sorts of psychological processes .
brain research has confirmed freud 's theory that the unconscious exists and that it is very significant for the understanding of the human mind and people 's actions . what captivates us so much about freud ? freud familiarizes us with parts of our psyche which are very deep and which we are n't directly aware of .
but we sense them .
through freud , we feel understood in our quintessential motivation in life and for our actions - both good and bad .
but it also makes us unpleasantly accessible .
he exposes us to something , which we do n't necessarily want to know . in what areas of our daily lives can we see freud 's legacy ? freud certainly influenced children 's upbringing and putting everyday life in a psychological or pedagogical perspective .
the fact that we have become more responsive to children and their needs , that we try to understand them , can largely be traced back to freud , although of course this has become common knowledge in psychology .
freud 's approach of understanding interaction through talking and empathy is not only evident in the case of children 's upbringing at home and in the school , but also for adults .
when it comes down to it , the encouragement of mutual exchange - that couples talk openly about problems in their relationship and their sexuality - can be attributed to freud . how did freud change people 's approach to sexual and personal fulfillment ? through freud , people got the notion at all that they have desires , which they should take seriously .
they became aware that their non-fulfillment can also lead to negative psychological developments up to the point of symptoms . what about freud 's influence on our cultural history ? psychoanalysis has played a key role in many areas of culture , such as literature , film and art history .
it started with the surrealists , who gave in to and expressed their inner being - painted the unconscious , so to speak .
this was a significant movement in 20th century art , which was also strongly influenced by freud .
you ca n't say freud was the sole reason for this movement .
but it was in the air and he put it into words .
in literature , freud had close contact to his contemporary writers and was recognized by many of them at the time .
the same was the case with scientists , such as albert einstein .
this recognition in the cultural world has continued through today .
literature , philosophy , art and cultural science , theology - all the humanities and cultural studies have dealt with freud very intensely . the sigmund freud institute -lrb- sfi -rrb- in frankfurt was opened in 1960 , over 20 years after the nazis destroyed the frankfurt psychoanalytic institute .
the sfi focuses both on training psychoanalysts , as well as researching psychoanalysis and its various applications . sabina casagrande interviewed hans-joachim busch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de therapy still taboo in germany germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch .

initially , the firm had planned to sell almost 50 million shares for 15-17.50 euros per share .
the company is expected to reap 225-284 million euros from the ipo .
concerns had been raised over the price of the shares and the future profitability of the airline in such a competitive market as the budget sector .
" air berlin has a limited history , a limited track record , and their expansion plans are pretty ambitious over the next two years , at a time when we know ryanair is planning to expand in germany , " said nigel bolton , head of equities at scottish widows investment partnership in an interview with bloomerg.com. the aggressive nature of the airline 's push for a share listing ahead of this summer 's soccer world cup in germany was due to be a loud and deliberate declaration of intent that air berlin is ready to mix it up with its rivals in a battle for a larger slice of the lucrative no-frills sector currently dominated by irish low-cost carrier ryanair and uk-based budget airline easyjet . the german budget market is also a cut-throat and crowded sector and air berlin is locked in a tussle for customers with competitors such as tui , hapag lloyd express -lrb- hlx -rrb- and germanwings as well as deutsche lufthansa and holiday airlines such as condor .

an additional 6.5 million shares may be issued through a potential over-allotment offering .

ministers have the answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prospective germans will have to undergo language and citizenship classes after months of political wrangling , interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states have agreed on common standards governing language and citizenship courses for migrants applying for a german passport . a two-day conference of state interior ministers in garmisch-partenkirchen , southern germany , ended friday with a breakthrough on the tricky question of what criteria a migrant needs to fulfill in order to qualify for german citizenship .
the issue has stirred hot debate across the country in recent months . günther beckstein , interior minister of bavaria and chairman of the conference , said on friday that all applicants in future will have to attend citizenship classes .
they will include learning about the basic values and fundaments of the german constitution and state . mandatory citizenship classes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants immigrants to pay for citizenship courses themselves the german federal office for migrants and refugees will be entrusted with developing the content and concept of the citizenship courses .
applicants will have to pay for the courses themselves . beckstein stressed that migrants had to sincerely attend the citizenship class in order to get a german passport .
" there has to be successful participation , " beckstein said , adding that merely furnishing proof of attendance would n't suffice . beckstein also said that participants would n't necessarily have to sit a formal test at the end of the course , but rather that their acquired knowledge would be tested in other ways .
he did n't specify what form that could take . the introduction of standardized citizenship courses effectively scratches out a controversial nationwide knowledge test as proposed by the states of hesse and baden-württemberg .
the tests in the two states , both ruled by the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had triggered widespread protest for questioning immigrants about their stance on homosexuality and women and a 100-question quiz on random german history and politics , among other things . migrants must learn german immigration ministers on friday also agreed on introducing common language tests for prospective germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants will have to speak german if they want to live here , according to beckstein " if you live in germany , you have to be able to understand and speak german , " beckstein said . he added that naturalization would be strengthened through an official ceremony and " through an oath or a ceremonial avowal . "
but it will be up to individual states to decide whether the current declaration of loyalty to the constitution will suffice . in addition , the two-day conference also reached agreement on tightening one aspect of the criteria by making it tougher for applicants with a criminal record to become german . " exceptions are possible , particularly in the case of driving offences , but we do n't want criminals taking on german citizenship , " beckstein said . compromise is " good news " most agree that the compromise is a fair one . " i 'm very happy with the result .
successful integration will now be crowned with citizenship , " ralf stegner , interior minister of schleswig-holstein and a social democrat said . the cdu 's domestic policy expert told a german new channel that the agreement was " good news .

the 2006 election saw the conservatives gain three seats , the lib dems gain two and the labour party lose five .
but the council remains with no one party in overall control with 18 labour members , 19 conservatives , two independents and nine lib dems .
the council fell to no overall control in 2004 after many years in labour hands .
at waveney , the conservatives held on to the council , making four gains - three from independents and one from labour .
mark bee , leader of the tories at waveney , said : " it has been a very good night for the conservative party .
" we are delighted to strengthen our majority and we have been helped by labour 's problems . "

those were the words of local bnp leader richard barnbrook before a single result had been declared in this battleground borough straddling the east end of london and essex .
barnbrook - now councillor barnbrook - had predicted that six to eight seats would fall to his team in barking and dagenham .
in the end it was 11 -lrb- and could be 12 once the final results are in -rrb- .
it is a breakthrough for the british national party in london , on a scale significantly greater than anyone had predicted .
the labour mp for barking and government minister margaret hodge said the bnp was a " nasty nasty party " - it lives on lies , exploits fears , and encourages racism , she said . "
even the bnp 's richard barnbrook made a point tonight of sarcastically thanking ms hodge for her " beautiful gift " " bnp makes gains asked how it had attracted thousands of votes here tonight , she dismissed the surge as a " protest vote " against labour .
but it is clear that the bnp has touched a nerve here .
it has campaigned tirelessly on the theme that immigrants are " swamping " east london , claiming that they are jumping the queues for council housing , and changing the look of what a decade ago was the territory of the white working class .
and margaret hodge herself is now feeling the heat .
the blairite minister made waves during the campaign when she declared that eight out of 10 white families were tempted to vote for the bnp .
many labour activists here are seething at her remarks , believing that she gave the bnp invaluable free publicity .
even the bnp 's richard barnbrook made a point tonight of sarcastically thanking ms hodge for her " beautiful gift " .
i asked her if she had any regrets .

the party has a majority of one after both the tory and labour candidates finished with 500 votes each , and lots had to be drawn after three recounts .
the tories also won hastings , in east sussex , for the first time since 1979 .
in surrey , of six district councils up for election , the conservatives gained mole valley from no overall control .
there was no change in the other areas .
labour had controlled crawley since 1971 , but nearly lost it two years ago when it hung on by a majority of one after winning a seat by just three votes . "
we 've lost this council , but we 'll be back " chris redmayne , former labour leader of crawley council bob lanzer , the new leader of crawley borough council , said the outcome this year was " truly historic " and it had been won on a " proper vision of political leadership " .
issues such as the health crisis dominated the campaign .
mr lanzer said residents had also voiced their displeasure over council tax , which had risen by 98 % since 1997 , and the council 's proposal to create two travellers ' sites .
the council 's former labour leader , chris redmayne , said his party had worked very hard in crawley on local matters and had tried to campaign on what it thought was important .
' good fight ' " we 've stuck with local issues and local matters .
we 've lost this council , but we 'll be back , " he said .
one candidate who failed to get elected in crawley was big brother 6 runner-up eugene sully , who was the labour candidate for furnace green .
the 29-year-old broadcast engineer said he thought he had put up a " good fight " .
" i felt there were things that i could offer the local council ... but i think i 'm going to have to concentrate my efforts next year to try and run again , " he said .
in hastings , where the tories gained four seats to take control with 17 , former labour leader jeremy birch said although disappointed at the result , his party would be a " vigorous and determined opposition " .
" i have got every confidence that in two years ' time labour will return to a majority position on hastings borough council , " he said .
mr birch added that he felt it had been a local election fought primarily on national issues and " we 've suffered as a result " .
peter pragnell , the new conservative leader of the council , said the result had been exciting given that eight years ago the party had no councillors out of 32 elected in total .
" we 've gone from the real doldrums ... to this , " he said .

the party has a majority of one after both the tory and labour candidates finished with 500 votes each , and lots had to be drawn after three recounts .
the tories also won hastings , in east sussex , for the first time since 1979 .
in surrey , of six district councils up for election , the conservatives gained mole valley from no overall control .
there was no change in the other areas .
labour had controlled crawley since 1971 , but nearly lost it two years ago when it hung on by a majority of one after winning a seat by just three votes .
we 've lost this council , but we 'll be back chris redmayne , former labour leader of crawley council bob lanzer , the new leader of crawley borough council , said the outcome this year was " truly historic " and it had been won on a " proper vision of political leadership " .
issues such as the health crisis dominated the campaign .
mr lanzer said residents had also voiced their displeasure over council tax , which had risen by 98 % since 1997 , and the council 's proposal to create two travellers ' sites .
the council 's former labour leader , chris redmayne , said his party had worked very hard in crawley on local matters and had tried to campaign on what it thought was important .
' good fight ' " we 've stuck with local issues and local matters .
we 've lost this council , but we 'll be back , " he said .
one candidate who failed to get elected in crawley was big brother 6 runner-up eugene sully , who was the labour candidate for furnace green .
the 29-year-old broadcast engineer said he thought he had put up a " good fight " .
" i felt there were things that i could offer the local council ... but i think i 'm going to have to concentrate my efforts next year to try and run again , " he said .
the tories were not represented in hastings eight years ago in hastings , where the tories gained four seats to take control with 17 , former labour leader jeremy birch said although disappointed at the result , his party would be a " vigorous and determined opposition " .
" i have got every confidence that in two years ' time labour will return to a majority position on hastings borough council , " he said .
mr birch added that he felt it had been a local election fought primarily on national issues and " we 've suffered as a result " .
peter pragnell , the new conservative leader of the council , said the result had been exciting given that eight years ago the party had no councillors out of 32 elected in total .
" we 've gone from the real doldrums ... to this , " he said .

mr baharloo insists that his programme will not be viewed as us propaganda and that there will be no editorial interference .
but he adds that he sees his purpose as " nullifying " the disinformation coming out of tehran .
unsurprisingly there are mixed views as to whether this will work .
the fact that it 's the voa taking the lead will raise suspicions - not everyone sees the voice of america as an impartial voice .
' do n't repeat mistakes ' mohsen sazegara returned to tehran on the same plane as ayatollah khomeini in 1979 to help usher in the islamic revolution .
he was a founder of the revolutionary guard and became a senior minister .
but he fell out with the country 's leaders by campaigning for reform .
he is now an exile lecturing at yale .
his advice to washington is : " do n't interfere . "
by all means , he says , press for democracy and freedom - but do n't make the mistakes of iraq and afghanistan .
he says it would be best to let the iranian opposition groups in the country take the lead .
this time , he believes , there should be no attempt to create an opposition in exile , no figurehead like ahmed chalabi - the iraqi opposition leader close to us defense department who many believe misled us officials on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
" leave these affairs to the iranian people , " mr sazegara advises .
warning of danger yet various siren voices are appealing to washington to help trigger regime change .
one group in particular claims to deserve special attention for uncovering iran 's clandestine nuclear programme and bringing it to the attention of the us .
alireza jafarzadeh was the spokesman of the national council of resistance of iran until its washington office was forced to close .
it is linked to the mujahedin e-khalq .
the us state department lists the mek as a terrorist group - in its annual report on terrorism the department says " the mek advocates the violent overthrow of the iranian regime " .
mr jafarzadeh is now an iranian expert offering his views to fox news , among others .
he believes that the us must change its policy on the mek if it is to change tehran .
he describes iran as a " five-headed dragon " that needs to be slain - listing iran 's support for terrorist groups , its interference in iraq , its antagonism towards israel and middle east peace talks , the suppression of the iranian people and the nuclear threat .
cold war model and then there are the calls for recognition from the monarch in hiding .
at a secret address in virginia , the son of the former shah - reza pahlavi - still keeps in touch by phone and the internet with his supporters in iran .
he also believes he has a role to play in bringing about change - but through non-violent means .
the us administration , though , is keeping its distance .
few see him as a figurehead to lead a new revolution .
instead the us is trying to engage the iranian people through its direct broadcasts - but influential exiles remain sceptical of the us policy as a whole .
abbas milani is an iranian academic now based at stanford university who has been advising " very senior figures " in the bush administration .
he would like to see washington talking openly and frankly to the leadership in tehran .
he says such a policy worked when president reagan talked to moscow during the cold war .
sanctions , he fears , are already hurting the iranian people - he says the current us embargo has been a " disaster " .
he also fears that targeted military strikes on iran 's nuclear facilities could set the reform movement back decades .
the real worry among many iranian exiles is that the current us policy could backfire - and end up empowering the ayatollahs .
