if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .
" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year . " we must have a global approach for a global problem , " bisignani said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .
-lrb- 19.12.2006 -rrb- germany supports caps on airline carbon dioxide emissions the german government supported eu plans to introduce binding climate protection guidelines for airlines and said it would address the issue after taking over the eu presidency next year .

but is an increase in mass-produced wares and chain-retailers turning off visitors ? if christmas markets seem to be everywhere in germany these days , it 's because they are .
according to diverse estimates , somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 markets are open across the country - in town squares , pedestrian zones , within the walls of castles , even on cruise ships . historically , christmas markets date back to the middle ages .
they began as places for german villagers to buy and sell holiday wares and a venue for local performers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people go to the market to drink mulled wine and socialize today , the markets - generally a collection of stalls selling handicrafts and ornaments as well as snacks and beverages - are a huge tourism draw , long considered an economic factor in and of themselves . big business in the weeks leading up to the holiday , busloads full of visitors from holland , france and britain flood into major cities such as munich , frankfurt , berlin , hamburg , and düsseldorf , as well as christmas-specific hubs like nuremberg and dresden .
there , they browse the stalls , eat german specialties and drink mulled wine in an authentic , if often kitschy , holiday ambiance . according to a 2002 study by the german market sellers association , an estimated 160 million people spent some 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- at the markets ; around half of the people polled were in town specifically for the market itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden ornaments are often big sellers underlying the growth in tourism revenues is a change in the nature of the christmas market itself .
still mostly run by individual municipalities , the markets are nonetheless trading their humble-origins approach for a marketing attack worthy of big business , said peter sedlacek , a professor of economic geography at the university of jena , who recently published an in-depth study comparing the christmas markets in the eastern cities of jena and erfurt . unstoppable trend " there are christmas markets being opened with a much more professional marketing push behind them , " sedlacek said .
this includes doing targeted advertising to promote a given market , and beefing up entertainment offerings , for example . " municipalities have realized what an important source of revenue this is , " he said .
" this trend is not going to stop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand made objects - here a käthe wohlfahrt music box - are more expensive than mass-produced parallel to the overall professionalization of the markets is a trend that sees local craftsmen being nudged aside by makers of mass-produced christmas items , making it more and more difficult to distinguish between one market and another , said klaus schultheis , who runs a german web site on christmas markets . " what -lrb- the big -rrb- markets are suffering from is a product range that is really homogenous , " schultheis said .
" you can go from market to market , and always see the same things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different christmas market : cologne 's medieval bazaar the mass produced items are often made in asia or eastern europe , and can be significantly cheaper than similar items hand-made in germany .
schultheis points to the typical offering of ceramic incense burners . social event " they used to be hand made , and you had to really look and choose , " he said .
" now , there are only one or two companies who make them .
i see the same ones every time i go to one of these booths .
the hunting is completely lost , hunting for some unusual or rare gift . " the more the markets look alike , schultheis said , the more letters and e-mails he gets from consumers and editors asking for tips on unusual christmas markets .
he steers them toward " romantic markets " or smaller ones that focus on local handicrafts or a particular atmosphere . yet , shultheis said , attendance at christmas markets continues to grow – despite some dissatisfaction with the products .
the reason ? " people go after work with colleagues – its more of a social event , for them it really has nothing to do with shopping , " he said . for his part , economist sedlacek compared today 's christmas markets to the omnipresent chain of aldi supermarkets , which are known for offering a reliably steady supply of cheap , quality goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to buy a beeswax candle ?
check your local christmas market " whether you see the trend toward unified christmas markets as positive or negative really depends what you expect from a christmas market , " he said . ambiance is key in fact , sedlacek noted , the people who he polled in his studies were less concerned by what was sold at the market 's stalls than by its general ambiance . " it should be full , but not too full , " he said .
" and the quality of sound was important ; there should be music but not too loud .
the products were n't decisive .
there should just be a good program , lots to see . " his study , and others , showed food and drink booths had primary importance , as well .
according to the 2002 german market sellers study , more than 57 percent of visitors went to the christmas markets with plans to eat and drink there , but only 35 percent went intending to buy a gift . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de santa 's turning a major profit at german christmas markets some might ask , " who actually buys all this kitsch ?

" we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .
organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .

the commission said that it had concluded that the acquisition " would not significantly impede effective competition in the -lrb- eu area -rrb- or any substantial part of it . " man formally launched a hostile takeover bid for scania on nov .
20 , offering 51.29 euros -lrb- $ 67.42 -rrb- per share or 10.2 billion euros in all . the german truck giant originally gave scania shareholders until dec .
11 to accept the terms , but has extended the deadline until jan .
31 , 2007 .
the scania board and the company 's key swedish shareholders have firmly rejected the man offer , saying it undervalued scania . kroes is " satisfied " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes competition commissioner neelie kroes said she was " satisfied that competition on price and technology will remain strong in the future on the bus and truck markets , in particular considering the increasing importance of environmentally-friendly technologies in this sector . " the merged entity would still face strong competition from other important manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler , volvo , iveco and daf . scania keeps resisting after the announcement , scania said it would continue to resist the takeover and the ruling would not influence its opposition . " we are not surprised , " a scania spokeswoman said .
" but the eu has now taken a stance on the market concentration issue .
the okay by the commission is linked to the fact that scania and man are strong in different regions of europe . " vw mulls future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what role will vw play ?
complicating the rancorous takeover battle are signs that scania 's biggest shareholder , german-based carmaker volkswagen ag , has been weighing up whether to try to orchestrate a three-way merger between man , scania and vw 's truck operations . but vw , which is also europe 's biggest automaker , has said that no concrete plan for a three-way merger existed .
with a 34-per-cent stake , vw is also man 's largest shareholder . " in the case of an apparent failure of the bid , volkswagen will keep all alternative possibilities open , " the vw board said at the end of a meeting last month . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw blazing new trails with winterkorn behind the wheel the volkswagen board announced friday that audi head martin winterkorn will take over the corporation in the new year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.12.2006 germany pulls away from quaero search-engine project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet users will continue googling as usual germany has taken a new tack in its plans to develop an internet search engine with france .
instead , it will pursue a national project aimed at tackling us dominance in the information sector . less than a year after french president jacques chirac hailed quaero as europe 's answer to the challenge posed by " american giants google and yahoo , " the ambitious project seems to have fallen by the wayside . germany will now work on its own search engine program named theseus after a legendary greek hero who found his way out of the labyrinth of the monster minotaur . " we will still see cooperation , but in another form , such as work groups , " hendrik luchtmeier , a spokesman for germany 's economics ministry , told idg news service .
" the consortium between the german and french governments is over . " division of labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll all fit together somehow , experts say but hendrik speck , a professor of digital media at the university of applied sciences kaiserslautern , described the move as a division of labor . " france is concentrating more on developing a search engine while the german project promotes innovative core technologies , " he said . luchtmeier declined to comment on the reasons why germany had decided to drop the joint venture , according to idg .
but he said that unlike quaero , theseus would not actually work on developing a search engine and instead back companies and organizations that conduct research in areas including search-technology research and advanced communication networks . luchtmeier did not say how much money germany will set aside for the project , but the government announced monday that it will set aside 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- . catching up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , google rules the search-engine world while the german effort might still pale in comparison to the huge research funds available at google , experts said that it was important to take a first step . " it does n't take a lot of money to set up a know-how infrastructure that 's missing in germany , " said wolfgang sander-beuermann , the head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover . he agreed with speck that the two separate projects were still viable and could even produce better results than a joint venture .
sander-beuermann also added that disagreements between companies involved in the franco-german cooperation might have played a role in the split . " it could be that the partners were fighting and decided that it 's better if each side does their own thing , " he said .
" it might have been similar to the situation at -lrb- european plane maker -rrb- airbus . " the important thing , sander-beuermann added , is that europe gets going in developing search-engine technology . " it 's not too late to catch up , " he said .

but is an increase in mass-produced wares and chain-retailers turning off visitors ? if christmas markets seem to be everywhere in germany these days , it 's because they are .
according to diverse estimates , somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 markets are open across the country - in town squares , pedestrian zones , within the walls of castles , even on cruise ships . historically , christmas markets date back to the middle ages .
they began as places for german villagers to buy and sell holiday wares and a venue for local performers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people go to the market to drink mulled wine and socialize today , the markets - generally a collection of stalls selling handicrafts and ornaments as well as snacks and beverages - are a huge tourism draw , long considered an economic factor in and of themselves . big business in the weeks leading up to the holiday , busloads full of visitors from holland , france and britain flood into major cities such as munich , frankfurt , berlin , hamburg , and düsseldorf , as well as christmas-specific hubs like nuremberg and dresden .
there , they browse the stalls , eat german specialties and drink mulled wine in an authentic , if often kitschy , holiday ambiance . according to a 2002 study by the german market sellers association , an estimated 160 million people spent some 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- at the markets ; around half of the people polled were in town specifically for the market itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden ornaments are often big sellers underlying the growth in tourism revenues is a change in the nature of the christmas market itself .
still mostly run by individual municipalities , the markets are nonetheless trading their humble-origins approach for a marketing attack worthy of big business , said peter sedlacek , a professor of economic geography at the university of jena , who recently published an in-depth study comparing the christmas markets in the eastern cities of jena and erfurt . unstoppable trend " there are christmas markets being opened with a much more professional marketing push behind them , " sedlacek said .
this includes doing targeted advertising to promote a given market , and beefing up entertainment offerings , for example . " municipalities have realized what an important source of revenue this is , " he said .
" this trend is not going to stop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand made objects - here a käthe wohlfahrt music box - are more expensive than mass-produced parallel to the overall professionalization of the markets is a trend that sees local craftsmen being nudged aside by makers of mass-produced christmas items , making it more and more difficult to distinguish between one market and another , said klaus schultheis , who runs a german web site on christmas markets . " what -lrb- the big -rrb- markets are suffering from is a product range that is really homogenous , " schultheis said .
" you can go from market to market , and always see the same things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different christmas market : cologne 's medieval bazaar the mass produced items are often made in asia or eastern europe , and can be significantly cheaper than similar items hand-made in germany .
schultheis points to the typical offering of ceramic incense burners . social event " they used to be hand made , and you had to really look and choose , " he said .
" now , there are only one or two companies who make them .
i see the same ones every time i go to one of these booths .
the hunting is completely lost , hunting for some unusual or rare gift . " the more the markets look alike , schultheis said , the more letters and e-mails he gets from consumers and editors asking for tips on unusual christmas markets .
he steers them toward " romantic markets " or smaller ones that focus on local handicrafts or a particular atmosphere . yet , shultheis said , attendance at christmas markets continues to grow – despite some dissatisfaction with the products .
the reason ? " people go after work with colleagues – its more of a social event , for them it really has nothing to do with shopping , " he said . for his part , economist sedlacek compared today 's christmas markets to the omnipresent chain of aldi supermarkets , which are known for offering a reliably steady supply of cheap , quality goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to buy a beeswax candle ?
check your local christmas market " whether you see the trend toward unified christmas markets as positive or negative really depends what you expect from a christmas market , " he said . ambiance is key in fact , sedlacek noted , the people who he polled in his studies were less concerned by what was sold at the market 's stalls than by its general ambiance . " it should be full , but not too full , " he said .
" and the quality of sound was important ; there should be music but not too loud .
the products were n't decisive .
there should just be a good program , lots to see . " his study , and others , showed food and drink booths had primary importance , as well .
according to the 2002 german market sellers study , more than 57 percent of visitors went to the christmas markets with plans to eat and drink there , but only 35 percent went intending to buy a gift . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de santa 's turning a major profit at german christmas markets some might ask , " who actually buys all this kitsch ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 21.12.2006 christmas markets mean big business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's christmas market is one of germany 's most-visited the christmas market business in germany is booming , with a record number of " weihnachtsmärkte " open around the country .
but is an increase in mass-produced wares and chain-retailers turning off visitors ? if christmas markets seem to be everywhere in germany these days , it 's because they are .
according to diverse estimates , somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 markets are open across the country - in town squares , pedestrian zones , within the walls of castles , even on cruise ships . historically , christmas markets date back to the middle ages .
they began as places for german villagers to buy and sell holiday wares and a venue for local performers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people go to the market to drink mulled wine and socialize today , the markets - generally a collection of stalls selling handicrafts and ornaments as well as snacks and beverages - are a huge tourism draw , long considered an economic factor in and of themselves . big business in the weeks leading up to the holiday , busloads full of visitors from holland , france and britain flood into major cities such as munich , frankfurt , berlin , hamburg , and düsseldorf , as well as christmas-specific hubs like nuremberg and dresden .
there , they browse the stalls , eat german specialties and drink mulled wine in an authentic , if often kitschy , holiday ambiance . according to a 2002 study by the german market sellers association , an estimated 160 million people spent some 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- at the markets ; around half of the people polled were in town specifically for the market itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden ornaments are often big sellers underlying the growth in tourism revenues is a change in the nature of the christmas market itself .
still mostly run by individual municipalities , the markets are nonetheless trading their humble-origins approach for a marketing attack worthy of big business , said peter sedlacek , a professor of economic geography at the university of jena , who recently published an in-depth study comparing the christmas markets in the eastern cities of jena and erfurt . unstoppable trend " there are christmas markets being opened with a much more professional marketing push behind them , " sedlacek said .
this includes doing targeted advertising to promote a given market , and beefing up entertainment offerings , for example . " municipalities have realized what an important source of revenue this is , " he said .
" this trend is not going to stop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand made objects - here a käthe wohlfahrt music box - are more expensive than mass-produced parallel to the overall professionalization of the markets is a trend that sees local craftsmen being nudged aside by makers of mass-produced christmas items , making it more and more difficult to distinguish between one market and another , said klaus schultheis , who runs a german web site on christmas markets . " what -lrb- the big -rrb- markets are suffering from is a product range that is really homogenous , " schultheis said .
" you can go from market to market , and always see the same things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different christmas market : cologne 's medieval bazaar the mass produced items are often made in asia or eastern europe , and can be significantly cheaper than similar items hand-made in germany .
schultheis points to the typical offering of ceramic incense burners . social event " they used to be hand made , and you had to really look and choose , " he said .
" now , there are only one or two companies who make them .
i see the same ones every time i go to one of these booths .
the hunting is completely lost , hunting for some unusual or rare gift . " the more the markets look alike , schultheis said , the more letters and e-mails he gets from consumers and editors asking for tips on unusual christmas markets .
he steers them toward " romantic markets " or smaller ones that focus on local handicrafts or a particular atmosphere . yet , shultheis said , attendance at christmas markets continues to grow – despite some dissatisfaction with the products .
the reason ? " people go after work with colleagues – its more of a social event , for them it really has nothing to do with shopping , " he said . for his part , economist sedlacek compared today 's christmas markets to the omnipresent chain of aldi supermarkets , which are known for offering a reliably steady supply of cheap , quality goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to buy a beeswax candle ?
check your local christmas market " whether you see the trend toward unified christmas markets as positive or negative really depends what you expect from a christmas market , " he said . ambiance is key in fact , sedlacek noted , the people who he polled in his studies were less concerned by what was sold at the market 's stalls than by its general ambiance . " it should be full , but not too full , " he said .
" and the quality of sound was important ; there should be music but not too loud .
the products were n't decisive .
there should just be a good program , lots to see . " his study , and others , showed food and drink booths had primary importance , as well .
according to the 2002 german market sellers study , more than 57 percent of visitors went to the christmas markets with plans to eat and drink there , but only 35 percent went intending to buy a gift . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de santa 's turning a major profit at german christmas markets some might ask , " who actually buys all this kitsch ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 21.12.2006 christmas markets mean big business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's christmas market is one of germany 's most-visited the christmas market business in germany is booming , with a record number of " weihnachtsmärkte " open around the country .
but is an increase in mass-produced wares and chain-retailers turning off visitors ? if christmas markets seem to be everywhere in germany these days , it 's because they are .
according to diverse estimates , somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 markets are open across the country - in town squares , pedestrian zones , within the walls of castles , even on cruise ships . historically , christmas markets date back to the middle ages .
they began as places for german villagers to buy and sell holiday wares and a venue for local performers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people go to the market to drink mulled wine and socialize today , the markets - generally a collection of stalls selling handicrafts and ornaments as well as snacks and beverages - are a huge tourism draw , long considered an economic factor in and of themselves . big business in the weeks leading up to the holiday , busloads full of visitors from holland , france and britain flood into major cities such as munich , frankfurt , berlin , hamburg , and düsseldorf , as well as christmas-specific hubs like nuremberg and dresden .
there , they browse the stalls , eat german specialties and drink mulled wine in an authentic , if often kitschy , holiday ambiance . according to a 2002 study by the german market sellers association , an estimated 160 million people spent some 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- at the markets ; around half of the people polled were in town specifically for the market itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden ornaments are often big sellers underlying the growth in tourism revenues is a change in the nature of the christmas market itself .
still mostly run by individual municipalities , the markets are nonetheless trading their humble-origins approach for a marketing attack worthy of big business , said peter sedlacek , a professor of economic geography at the university of jena , who recently published an in-depth study comparing the christmas markets in the eastern cities of jena and erfurt . unstoppable trend " there are christmas markets being opened with a much more professional marketing push behind them , " sedlacek said .
this includes doing targeted advertising to promote a given market , and beefing up entertainment offerings , for example . " municipalities have realized what an important source of revenue this is , " he said .
" this trend is not going to stop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand made objects - here a käthe wohlfahrt music box - are more expensive than mass-produced parallel to the overall professionalization of the markets is a trend that sees local craftsmen being nudged aside by makers of mass-produced christmas items , making it more and more difficult to distinguish between one market and another , said klaus schultheis , who runs a german web site on christmas markets . " what -lrb- the big -rrb- markets are suffering from is a product range that is really homogenous , " schultheis said .
" you can go from market to market , and always see the same things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different christmas market : cologne 's medieval bazaar the mass produced items are often made in asia or eastern europe , and can be significantly cheaper than similar items hand-made in germany .
schultheis points to the typical offering of ceramic incense burners . social event " they used to be hand made , and you had to really look and choose , " he said .
" now , there are only one or two companies who make them .
i see the same ones every time i go to one of these booths .
the hunting is completely lost , hunting for some unusual or rare gift . " the more the markets look alike , schultheis said , the more letters and e-mails he gets from consumers and editors asking for tips on unusual christmas markets .
he steers them toward " romantic markets " or smaller ones that focus on local handicrafts or a particular atmosphere . yet , shultheis said , attendance at christmas markets continues to grow – despite some dissatisfaction with the products .
the reason ? " people go after work with colleagues – its more of a social event , for them it really has nothing to do with shopping , " he said . for his part , economist sedlacek compared today 's christmas markets to the omnipresent chain of aldi supermarkets , which are known for offering a reliably steady supply of cheap , quality goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to buy a beeswax candle ?
check your local christmas market " whether you see the trend toward unified christmas markets as positive or negative really depends what you expect from a christmas market , " he said . ambiance is key in fact , sedlacek noted , the people who he polled in his studies were less concerned by what was sold at the market 's stalls than by its general ambiance . " it should be full , but not too full , " he said .
" and the quality of sound was important ; there should be music but not too loud .
the products were n't decisive .
there should just be a good program , lots to see . " his study , and others , showed food and drink booths had primary importance , as well .
according to the 2002 german market sellers study , more than 57 percent of visitors went to the christmas markets with plans to eat and drink there , but only 35 percent went intending to buy a gift . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de santa 's turning a major profit at german christmas markets some might ask , " who actually buys all this kitsch ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.12.2006 german early warning system for south asia two years away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's proximity to earthquakes leaves locals with less time to react to tsunami warnings nearly two years after a tsunami swept across southern asia killing over 200,000 people , researchers in germany said it will take them two more years to implement an ambitious early warning system for the region . after describing the progress made so far , scientists from the potsdam-based geo research center said they are confident a robust warning system for the area will be up and running in 2008 . " we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .
organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.12.2006 germany pulls away from quaero search-engine project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet users will continue googling as usual germany has taken a new tack in its plans to develop an internet search engine with france .
instead , it will pursue a national project aimed at tackling us dominance in the information sector . less than a year after french president jacques chirac hailed quaero as europe 's answer to the challenge posed by " american giants google and yahoo , " the ambitious project seems to have fallen by the wayside . germany will now work on its own search engine program named theseus after a legendary greek hero who found his way out of the labyrinth of the monster minotaur . " we will still see cooperation , but in another form , such as work groups , " hendrik luchtmeier , a spokesman for germany 's economics ministry , told idg news service .
" the consortium between the german and french governments is over . " division of labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll all fit together somehow , experts say but hendrik speck , a professor of digital media at the university of applied sciences kaiserslautern , described the move as a division of labor . " france is concentrating more on developing a search engine while the german project promotes innovative core technologies , " he said . luchtmeier declined to comment on the reasons why germany had decided to drop the joint venture , according to idg .

1 romania has prepared for its role as the european union 's new eastern border by installing a new high-tech security system on its frontier to keep non-eu citizens from entering the bloc it joins in january . at a cost of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 691 million -rrb- , the system set up by european aerospace group eads , will for the first time link all romania 's border posts to a central network and enable faster and more efficient passport checks . but analysts differ over whether the enlargement of the eu 's borders will cause a crisis as it puts the union next to romania 's poor neighbors moldova and ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarette smuggling plagues eastern european borders a french military adviser to the romanian interior ministry told the afp news service that as of 2007 " there will certainly be strong pressure by clandestine immigrants , mainly from the third world , on romania 's border . " " no migration wave " he said the immigrants would mostly come from ukraine since moldova " is the most closed and sovietized country in the region , " referring to that state 's authoritarian government . political analyst cristian pirvulescu , however , said he did not think romania 's new role as the eu 's border would set off " a wave of migration . " those who wanted to emigrate to the west from countries like moldova have already done so , pirvulescu said . in any case , romania has updated its monitoring capability .

" it is true that we are finding more and more moldavians with false romanian passports and we arrest smugglers every day , " said a security official at the albita post , which is in iasi , along the serbian-ukraine border . some 500,000 packets of cigarettes , worth an estimated 285,000 euros , were smuggled into romania between may and october . drug smuggling is down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to avoid censure , romania must comply with eu rules " at 50 cents , a packet of cigarettes in the ukraine is half as expensive as in romania , " said ilie poroch , commissioner of the radauti border post with ukraine . drug trafficking on the other hand is down : about 30 kilograms -lrb- 66 pounds -rrb- were found in 2006 , compared to 141 kilograms in 2005 . arms trafficking is also low : less than 20 firearms and a few kilograms of explosives were recovered in 2006 . smugglers of large volumes of light weapons , partly manufactured in the breakaway region of transdniestr in northern moldova , prefer to use alternative routes via the black sea and the bosporus . dw staf / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament will vote on romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism in december .

the wwf warned that the eu plan will speed up the extinction of depleted fish stocks , particularly cod . cod under protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing quotas aim to save endangered species in 2007 , quotas on north sea cod will be reduced by 14 percent and fewer days will be allowed for fishing .
that 's significantly more lenient than the 25 percent cut suggested by the european commission , the eu 's executive arm . " there are indications that juvenile cod ... are in figures far better than what we had in the previous year .
this is the first indication that there is a recovery in cod , " borg said . environmental groups disagree .
they say quotas miss the point entirely , as stocks can only recover if there is a total ban on cod fishing . " mocking scientific advice has become standard practice in the decisions " of eu fisheries ministers , the wwf said . ministers also cut 10 percent of allowable bluefin tuna catch in the mediterranean . ministers increased the allowable catch for other species , such as northern hake and bay of biscay sole . anchovy ban scrapped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries often fight over fish quotas a commission plan to ban anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay during the first half of 2007 was also scrapped .
while the ban technically exists , limited , monitored fishing will be permitted by 28 spanish and french vessels . british celebrity chef hugh fearnley whittingstall decried the " extraordinary mismanagement of our seas , " in a wwf news release .
he worried that local stocks of cod will be so depleted that the future of beloved british fish and chips is in danger . " if the fisheries collapse then it is not just the fishermen that will suffer .
the environment will suffer as fish are brought from further a field , " whittingstall said .
" chefs and the public will suffer as we will no longer be able to find high quality , freshly-caught fish on our doorstep . " the yearly quotas have caused controversy since the eu estalished a new fisheries policy in 2003 .
the eu wants to move to long-term quotas .
the management plans aim to keep fish stocks at safe biological levels . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules to save deep water fish stocks eu fisheries ministers agreed on a set of measures to slow overfishing in european waters .
but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists .

" we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .

but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes .

organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes . " new radio broadcasting system planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are also working on making sure people know where to go if a warning is issued while the german scientists add more gps-fitted buoys and ocean sensors to the network , others are training local authorities and institutions in how to react on tsunami warnings . 2wcom , a private company in the northern german town of flensburg , is adapting a system of european radio signals that will be capable of breaking into radio programming to broadcast the tsunami warnings and keep the population informed about imminent danger .
the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 21.12.2006 eu carbon trading scheme for airlines angers us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says the scheme will cut carbon dioxide emissions from planes us officials have criticized the eu 's new plan to set emission quotas for planes by 2011 , saying that the move will undermine international efforts to limit the environmental damage caused by aviation . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .

if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?

" we were too convinced that we had the match under control , " he said .
" this was not the case and then we made mistakes . " both german national striker bastian schweinsteiger and dutch international roy makaay were guilty of failing to find the net in the game 's early minutes despite their team being highly favored and having the better of play . even aachen coach michael frontzeck admitted bayern were the better side in the first half and should have taken the lead . " we had three shots and made three goals , " he said " that of course is very good , but bayern were really better . " while the 20,800 fans packed into aachen 's sold-out tivoli stadium cheered their team after the final whistle , the bavarians went to the locker room with their hopes of defending the cup title for a third season quashed . " of course we are disappointed as we wanted to defend the title , " magath said .
" but we lost against a strong and fighting aachen side .
i think it was a terrific match and the spectators would have enjoyed it . " aachen were also responsible for doing away with the bavarians the last time they failed to win the german cup in 2004 . aachen up 3-0 at halftime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath was n't as pleased as some 20,800 fans in aachen munich were down three goals by the break as laurentiu reghecampf opened the scoring with a freekick in the 11th minute .
he added a second six minutes from the break after going around two markers before unleashing a powerful shot leaving no chance for bayern goalkeeper michael rensing , who got a rare chance between the posts ahead of former germany keeper oliver kahn . marius ebbers gave the home side a convincing lead in the last minute of the first half after being sent through by matthias lehmann . but bayern staged a furious comeback in the second 45 minutes and cut the difference to one goal . poldi got bayern back in game magath brought on lukas podolski in the second half for the disappointing andreas ottl and the germany striker took just two minutes to make his mark after being set up by strike partner roy makaay . podolski went into the aachen area and pushed the ball past goalkeeper stephan straub . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is n't expected to stay in aachen too much longer dutch international mark van bommel gave his side a second goal in the 68th minute with a shot from 16 meters .
bayern continued pushing forward in search of an equalizer , but that allowed aachen the opportunity to counter and jan schlaudraff , whom bayern is trying to sign , used one of the chances to put the game beyond the holders ' reach . " we were running on fumes at the end , " schlaudraff said .
" we knew it would be tough to stop bayern from showing their individual qualities and it certainly was .
they had chances but the difference was we took ours . " cup up for grabs as favorites watch from home with favorites bayern out the cup looks wide open particularly as werder bremen and schalke 04 , joint leaders in the league , have also been eliminated . earlier bundesliga sides hanover 96 and vfl wolfsburg made no mistakes against lower league opposition as they won their matches . hanover scored two minutes into injury time in the first half to secure a 1-0 victory against high-flying second division club msv duisburg . the only goal of the game came from a long-range effort by hanno balitsch , whose shot from 25 meters slammed into the net past goalkeeper georg koch , who should have done better though . final eight decided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg assured themselves a place among the final eight beating unterhaching in fürth , wolfsburg managed to oust the local second division club greuther fürth 3-1 .
jacek krzynowek opened the scoring for the visitors in the 17th minute , argentine diego klimowicz added a second in the 56th minute . the second division team had brief hopes of coming back into the game after midfielder stephan schröck pulled one back for the home side , but dutch striker rick hoogendorp made sure of wolfsburg 's passage into the next round with a third goal for the visitors in injury time . in an all-second division clash kickers offenbach beat wacker burghausen 2-1 with a last-gasp goal scored by dino toppmöller .
offenbach , whose last appearance in the quarter-finals of the german cup dates back 16 years , is the only second division club in the round of the last eight . on tuesday , vfb stuttgart advanced with a 4-1 victory at vfl bochum , while eintracht frankfurt beat cologne 3-1 after extra time . nuremberg needed four saves by their second choice goalkeeper to beat second division spvgg unterhaching 2-1 on penalties , while hertha berlin won 3-0 at third division vfl osnabrueck . the quarter-finals will be played on feb .

" we were too convinced that we had the match under control , " he said .
" this was not the case and then we made mistakes . " both german national striker bastian schweinsteiger and dutch international roy makaay were guilty of failing to find the net in the game 's early minutes despite their team being highly favored and having the better of play . even aachen coach michael frontzeck admitted bayern were the better side in the first half and should have taken the lead . " we had three shots and made three goals , " he said " that of course is very good , but bayern were really better . " while the 20,800 fans packed into aachen 's sold-out tivoli stadium cheered their team after the final whistle , the bavarians went to the locker room with their hopes of defending the cup title for a third season quashed . " of course we are disappointed as we wanted to defend the title , " magath said .
" but we lost against a strong and fighting aachen side .
i think it was a terrific match and the spectators would have enjoyed it . " aachen were also responsible for doing away with the bavarians the last time they failed to win the german cup in 2004 . aachen up 3-0 at halftime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath was n't as pleased as some 20,800 fans in aachen munich were down three goals by the break as laurentiu reghecampf opened the scoring with a freekick in the 11th minute .
he added a second six minutes from the break after going around two markers before unleashing a powerful shot leaving no chance for bayern goalkeeper michael rensing , who got a rare chance between the posts ahead of former germany keeper oliver kahn . marius ebbers gave the home side a convincing lead in the last minute of the first half after being sent through by matthias lehmann . but bayern staged a furious comeback in the second 45 minutes and cut the difference to one goal . poldi got bayern back in game magath brought on lukas podolski in the second half for the disappointing andreas ottl and the germany striker took just two minutes to make his mark after being set up by strike partner roy makaay . podolski went into the aachen area and pushed the ball past goalkeeper stephan straub . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is n't expected to stay in aachen too much longer dutch international mark van bommel gave his side a second goal in the 68th minute with a shot from 16 meters .
bayern continued pushing forward in search of an equalizer , but that allowed aachen the opportunity to counter and jan schlaudraff , whom bayern is trying to sign , used one of the chances to put the game beyond the holders ' reach . " we were running on fumes at the end , " schlaudraff said .
" we knew it would be tough to stop bayern from showing their individual qualities and it certainly was .
they had chances but the difference was we took ours . " cup up for grabs as favorites watch from home with favorites bayern out the cup looks wide open particularly as werder bremen and schalke 04 , joint leaders in the league , have also been eliminated . earlier bundesliga sides hanover 96 and vfl wolfsburg made no mistakes against lower league opposition as they won their matches . hanover scored two minutes into injury time in the first half to secure a 1-0 victory against high-flying second division club msv duisburg . the only goal of the game came from a long-range effort by hanno balitsch , whose shot from 25 meters slammed into the net past goalkeeper georg koch , who should have done better though . final eight decided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg assured themselves a place among the final eight beating unterhaching in fürth , wolfsburg managed to oust the local second division club greuther fürth 3-1 .
jacek krzynowek opened the scoring for the visitors in the 17th minute , argentine diego klimowicz added a second in the 56th minute . the second division team had brief hopes of coming back into the game after midfielder stephan schröck pulled one back for the home side , but dutch striker rick hoogendorp made sure of wolfsburg 's passage into the next round with a third goal for the visitors in injury time . in an all-second division clash kickers offenbach beat wacker burghausen 2-1 with a last-gasp goal scored by dino toppmöller .
offenbach , whose last appearance in the quarter-finals of the german cup dates back 16 years , is the only second division club in the round of the last eight . on tuesday , vfb stuttgart advanced with a 4-1 victory at vfl bochum , while eintracht frankfurt beat cologne 3-1 after extra time . nuremberg needed four saves by their second choice goalkeeper to beat second division spvgg unterhaching 2-1 on penalties , while hertha berlin won 3-0 at third division vfl osnabrueck . the quarter-finals will be played on feb .

but is an increase in mass-produced wares and chain-retailers turning off visitors ? if christmas markets seem to be everywhere in germany these days , it 's because they are .
according to diverse estimates , somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 markets are open across the country - in town squares , pedestrian zones , within the walls of castles , even on cruise ships . historically , christmas markets date back to the middle ages .
they began as places for german villagers to buy and sell holiday wares and a venue for local performers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people go to the market to drink mulled wine and socialize today , the markets - generally a collection of stalls selling handicrafts and ornaments as well as snacks and beverages - are a huge tourism draw , long considered an economic factor in and of themselves . big business in the weeks leading up to the holiday , busloads full of visitors from holland , france and britain flood into major cities such as munich , frankfurt , berlin , hamburg , and düsseldorf , as well as christmas-specific hubs like nuremberg and dresden .
there , they browse the stalls , eat german specialties and drink mulled wine in an authentic , if often kitschy , holiday ambiance . according to a 2002 study by the german market sellers association , an estimated 160 million people spent some 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- at the markets ; around half of the people polled were in town specifically for the market itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden ornaments are often big sellers underlying the growth in tourism revenues is a change in the nature of the christmas market itself .
still mostly run by individual municipalities , the markets are nonetheless trading their humble-origins approach for a marketing attack worthy of big business , said peter sedlacek , a professor of economic geography at the university of jena , who recently published an in-depth study comparing the christmas markets in the eastern cities of jena and erfurt . unstoppable trend " there are christmas markets being opened with a much more professional marketing push behind them , " sedlacek said .
this includes doing targeted advertising to promote a given market , and beefing up entertainment offerings , for example . " municipalities have realized what an important source of revenue this is , " he said .
" this trend is not going to stop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand made objects - here a käthe wohlfahrt music box - are more expensive than mass-produced parallel to the overall professionalization of the markets is a trend that sees local craftsmen being nudged aside by makers of mass-produced christmas items , making it more and more difficult to distinguish between one market and another , said klaus schultheis , who runs a german web site on christmas markets . " what -lrb- the big -rrb- markets are suffering from is a product range that is really homogenous , " schultheis said .
" you can go from market to market , and always see the same things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different christmas market : cologne 's medieval bazaar the mass produced items are often made in asia or eastern europe , and can be significantly cheaper than similar items hand-made in germany .
schultheis points to the typical offering of ceramic incense burners . social event " they used to be hand made , and you had to really look and choose , " he said .
" now , there are only one or two companies who make them .
i see the same ones every time i go to one of these booths .
the hunting is completely lost , hunting for some unusual or rare gift . " the more the markets look alike , schultheis said , the more letters and e-mails he gets from consumers and editors asking for tips on unusual christmas markets .
he steers them toward " romantic markets " or smaller ones that focus on local handicrafts or a particular atmosphere . yet , shultheis said , attendance at christmas markets continues to grow – despite some dissatisfaction with the products .
the reason ? " people go after work with colleagues – its more of a social event , for them it really has nothing to do with shopping , " he said . for his part , economist sedlacek compared today 's christmas markets to the omnipresent chain of aldi supermarkets , which are known for offering a reliably steady supply of cheap , quality goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to buy a beeswax candle ?
check your local christmas market " whether you see the trend toward unified christmas markets as positive or negative really depends what you expect from a christmas market , " he said . ambiance is key in fact , sedlacek noted , the people who he polled in his studies were less concerned by what was sold at the market 's stalls than by its general ambiance . " it should be full , but not too full , " he said .
" and the quality of sound was important ; there should be music but not too loud .
the products were n't decisive .
there should just be a good program , lots to see . " his study , and others , showed food and drink booths had primary importance , as well .
according to the 2002 german market sellers study , more than 57 percent of visitors went to the christmas markets with plans to eat and drink there , but only 35 percent went intending to buy a gift . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de santa 's turning a major profit at german christmas markets some might ask , " who actually buys all this kitsch ?

if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .
" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year .

if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .

the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .

iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.12.2006 german early warning system for south asia two years away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's proximity to earthquakes leaves locals with less time to react to tsunami warnings nearly two years after a tsunami swept across southern asia killing over 200,000 people , researchers in germany said it will take them two more years to implement an ambitious early warning system for the region . after describing the progress made so far , scientists from the potsdam-based geo research center said they are confident a robust warning system for the area will be up and running in 2008 . " we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .
organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes . " new radio broadcasting system planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are also working on making sure people know where to go if a warning is issued while the german scientists add more gps-fitted buoys and ocean sensors to the network , others are training local authorities and institutions in how to react on tsunami warnings . 2wcom , a private company in the northern german town of flensburg , is adapting a system of european radio signals that will be capable of breaking into radio programming to broadcast the tsunami warnings and keep the population informed about imminent danger .
the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

" we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .

" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes .

the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

" we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .
organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes . " new radio broadcasting system planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are also working on making sure people know where to go if a warning is issued while the german scientists add more gps-fitted buoys and ocean sensors to the network , others are training local authorities and institutions in how to react on tsunami warnings . 2wcom , a private company in the northern german town of flensburg , is adapting a system of european radio signals that will be capable of breaking into radio programming to broadcast the tsunami warnings and keep the population informed about imminent danger .
the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

but environmental groups say the 2007 quotas will mean disaster for threatened fish such as cod and anchovies . the annual fight over eu fishing rights ended with an agreement thursday .
some fishing limits will be eased , others tightened under the 2007 fishing quotas . the eu tried to find a balance between protecting threatened fish without destroying the fishing industry , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg told reporters . the world wildlife fund environmental group criticized the plan , saying that ministers traded fishing quotas while ignoring the crisis facing fish .
the wwf warned that the eu plan will speed up the extinction of depleted fish stocks , particularly cod . cod under protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing quotas aim to save endangered species in 2007 , quotas on north sea cod will be reduced by 14 percent and fewer days will be allowed for fishing .
that 's significantly more lenient than the 25 percent cut suggested by the european commission , the eu 's executive arm . " there are indications that juvenile cod ... are in figures far better than what we had in the previous year .
this is the first indication that there is a recovery in cod , " borg said . environmental groups disagree .
they say quotas miss the point entirely , as stocks can only recover if there is a total ban on cod fishing . " mocking scientific advice has become standard practice in the decisions " of eu fisheries ministers , the wwf said . ministers also cut 10 percent of allowable bluefin tuna catch in the mediterranean . ministers increased the allowable catch for other species , such as northern hake and bay of biscay sole . anchovy ban scrapped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries often fight over fish quotas a commission plan to ban anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay during the first half of 2007 was also scrapped .
while the ban technically exists , limited , monitored fishing will be permitted by 28 spanish and french vessels . british celebrity chef hugh fearnley whittingstall decried the " extraordinary mismanagement of our seas , " in a wwf news release .
he worried that local stocks of cod will be so depleted that the future of beloved british fish and chips is in danger . " if the fisheries collapse then it is not just the fishermen that will suffer .
the environment will suffer as fish are brought from further a field , " whittingstall said .
" chefs and the public will suffer as we will no longer be able to find high quality , freshly-caught fish on our doorstep . " the yearly quotas have caused controversy since the eu estalished a new fisheries policy in 2003 .
the eu wants to move to long-term quotas .
the management plans aim to keep fish stocks at safe biological levels . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets rules to save deep water fish stocks eu fisheries ministers agreed on a set of measures to slow overfishing in european waters .
but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists .

2008 a german court has said berlin 's nazi-era airport , tempelhof , which was supposed to close on oct 31 , 2007 , could stay open for another year in a compromise deal . " it is an attempt to create judicial peace , " said judge jürgen kipp . thirteen companies had filed an appeal to keep the airport open arguing they would be disadvantaged by the forced move to the site of the new berlin brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- because of its poor transport connections . tempelhof is only six kilometers from the center of berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when tempelhof closes , the airlines and flight companies will have to move to the new bbi site avoiding competition the bbi is being built on berlin 's southeast border on the site of schönefeld airport in the state of brandenburg , and is expected to open in late 2011 . the states of berlin and brandenburg voted to close tempelhof so as not to have additional competition for the bbi . berlin 's third airport of tegel , in the city 's north , is due to shut as soon as bbi is open for business .
the number of airports currently serving germany 's capital is a legacy of its divided past . future plans it is not yet clear what will happen to the massive tempelhof complex once it is closed .
germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , said it would be interested in investing in a plan proposed by the former chairman of estée lauder , fred langhammer , to construct a giant health and wellness center on the tempelhof site . another investor group , the silicon valley based capricorn management , also announced a business concept for tempelhof earlier this week .

" we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .
organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes . " new radio broadcasting system planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are also working on making sure people know where to go if a warning is issued while the german scientists add more gps-fitted buoys and ocean sensors to the network , others are training local authorities and institutions in how to react on tsunami warnings . 2wcom , a private company in the northern german town of flensburg , is adapting a system of european radio signals that will be capable of breaking into radio programming to broadcast the tsunami warnings and keep the population informed about imminent danger .
the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

instead , it will pursue a national project aimed at tackling us dominance in the information sector . less than a year after french president jacques chirac hailed quaero as europe 's answer to the challenge posed by " american giants google and yahoo , " the ambitious project seems to have fallen by the wayside . germany will now work on its own search engine program named theseus after a legendary greek hero who found his way out of the labyrinth of the monster minotaur . " we will still see cooperation , but in another form , such as work groups , " hendrik luchtmeier , a spokesman for germany 's economics ministry , told idg news service .
" the consortium between the german and french governments is over . " division of labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll all fit together somehow , experts say but hendrik speck , a professor of digital media at the university of applied sciences kaiserslautern , described the move as a division of labor . " france is concentrating more on developing a search engine while the german project promotes innovative core technologies , " he said . luchtmeier declined to comment on the reasons why germany had decided to drop the joint venture , according to idg .
but he said that unlike quaero , theseus would not actually work on developing a search engine and instead back companies and organizations that conduct research in areas including search-technology research and advanced communication networks . luchtmeier did not say how much money germany will set aside for the project , but the government announced monday that it will set aside 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- . catching up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , google rules the search-engine world while the german effort might still pale in comparison to the huge research funds available at google , experts said that it was important to take a first step . " it does n't take a lot of money to set up a know-how infrastructure that 's missing in germany , " said wolfgang sander-beuermann , the head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover . he agreed with speck that the two separate projects were still viable and could even produce better results than a joint venture .
sander-beuermann also added that disagreements between companies involved in the franco-german cooperation might have played a role in the split . " it could be that the partners were fighting and decided that it 's better if each side does their own thing , " he said .
" it might have been similar to the situation at -lrb- european plane maker -rrb- airbus . " the important thing , sander-beuermann added , is that europe gets going in developing search-engine technology . " it 's not too late to catch up , " he said .

instead , it will pursue a national project aimed at tackling us dominance in the information sector . less than a year after french president jacques chirac hailed quaero as europe 's answer to the challenge posed by " american giants google and yahoo , " the ambitious project seems to have fallen by the wayside . germany will now work on its own search engine program named theseus after a legendary greek hero who found his way out of the labyrinth of the monster minotaur . " we will still see cooperation , but in another form , such as work groups , " hendrik luchtmeier , a spokesman for germany 's economics ministry , told idg news service .
" the consortium between the german and french governments is over . " division of labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll all fit together somehow , experts say but hendrik speck , a professor of digital media at the university of applied sciences kaiserslautern , described the move as a division of labor . " france is concentrating more on developing a search engine while the german project promotes innovative core technologies , " he said . luchtmeier declined to comment on the reasons why germany had decided to drop the joint venture , according to idg .
but he said that unlike quaero , theseus would not actually work on developing a search engine and instead back companies and organizations that conduct research in areas including search-technology research and advanced communication networks . luchtmeier did not say how much money germany will set aside for the project , but the government announced monday that it will set aside 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- . catching up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , google rules the search-engine world while the german effort might still pale in comparison to the huge research funds available at google , experts said that it was important to take a first step . " it does n't take a lot of money to set up a know-how infrastructure that 's missing in germany , " said wolfgang sander-beuermann , the head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover . he agreed with speck that the two separate projects were still viable and could even produce better results than a joint venture .
sander-beuermann also added that disagreements between companies involved in the franco-german cooperation might have played a role in the split . " it could be that the partners were fighting and decided that it 's better if each side does their own thing , " he said .
" it might have been similar to the situation at -lrb- european plane maker -rrb- airbus . " the important thing , sander-beuermann added , is that europe gets going in developing search-engine technology . " it 's not too late to catch up , " he said .
" but it will be soon , if nothing changes .

he worried that local stocks of cod will be so depleted that the future of beloved british fish and chips is in danger . " if the fisheries collapse then it is not just the fishermen that will suffer .
the environment will suffer as fish are brought from further a field , " whittingstall said .
" chefs and the public will suffer as we will no longer be able to find high quality , freshly-caught fish on our doorstep . " the yearly quotas have caused controversy since the eu estalished a new fisheries policy in 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.12.2006 german early warning system for south asia two years away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's proximity to earthquakes leaves locals with less time to react to tsunami warnings nearly two years after a tsunami swept across southern asia killing over 200,000 people , researchers in germany said it will take them two more years to implement an ambitious early warning system for the region . after describing the progress made so far , scientists from the potsdam-based geo research center said they are confident a robust warning system for the area will be up and running in 2008 . " we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .
organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes . " new radio broadcasting system planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are also working on making sure people know where to go if a warning is issued while the german scientists add more gps-fitted buoys and ocean sensors to the network , others are training local authorities and institutions in how to react on tsunami warnings . 2wcom , a private company in the northern german town of flensburg , is adapting a system of european radio signals that will be capable of breaking into radio programming to broadcast the tsunami warnings and keep the population informed about imminent danger .
the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

the commission said that it had concluded that the acquisition " would not significantly impede effective competition in the -lrb- eu area -rrb- or any substantial part of it . " man formally launched a hostile takeover bid for scania on nov .
20 , offering 51.29 euros -lrb- $ 67.42 -rrb- per share or 10.2 billion euros in all . the german truck giant originally gave scania shareholders until dec .
11 to accept the terms , but has extended the deadline until jan .
31 , 2007 .
the scania board and the company 's key swedish shareholders have firmly rejected the man offer , saying it undervalued scania . kroes is " satisfied " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes competition commissioner neelie kroes said she was " satisfied that competition on price and technology will remain strong in the future on the bus and truck markets , in particular considering the increasing importance of environmentally-friendly technologies in this sector . " the merged entity would still face strong competition from other important manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler , volvo , iveco and daf . scania keeps resisting after the announcement , scania said it would continue to resist the takeover and the ruling would not influence its opposition . " we are not surprised , " a scania spokeswoman said .

2008 a german court has said berlin 's nazi-era airport , tempelhof , which was supposed to close on oct 31 , 2007 , could stay open for another year in a compromise deal . " it is an attempt to create judicial peace , " said judge jürgen kipp . thirteen companies had filed an appeal to keep the airport open arguing they would be disadvantaged by the forced move to the site of the new berlin brandenburg international airport -lrb- bbi -rrb- because of its poor transport connections . tempelhof is only six kilometers from the center of berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when tempelhof closes , the airlines and flight companies will have to move to the new bbi site avoiding competition the bbi is being built on berlin 's southeast border on the site of schönefeld airport in the state of brandenburg , and is expected to open in late 2011 . the states of berlin and brandenburg voted to close tempelhof so as not to have additional competition for the bbi . berlin 's third airport of tegel , in the city 's north , is due to shut as soon as bbi is open for business .
the number of airports currently serving germany 's capital is a legacy of its divided past . future plans it is not yet clear what will happen to the massive tempelhof complex once it is closed .

" we were too convinced that we had the match under control , " he said .
" this was not the case and then we made mistakes . " both german national striker bastian schweinsteiger and dutch international roy makaay were guilty of failing to find the net in the game 's early minutes despite their team being highly favored and having the better of play . even aachen coach michael frontzeck admitted bayern were the better side in the first half and should have taken the lead . " we had three shots and made three goals , " he said " that of course is very good , but bayern were really better . " while the 20,800 fans packed into aachen 's sold-out tivoli stadium cheered their team after the final whistle , the bavarians went to the locker room with their hopes of defending the cup title for a third season quashed . " of course we are disappointed as we wanted to defend the title , " magath said .
" but we lost against a strong and fighting aachen side .
i think it was a terrific match and the spectators would have enjoyed it . " aachen were also responsible for doing away with the bavarians the last time they failed to win the german cup in 2004 . aachen up 3-0 at halftime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath was n't as pleased as some 20,800 fans in aachen munich were down three goals by the break as laurentiu reghecampf opened the scoring with a freekick in the 11th minute .
he added a second six minutes from the break after going around two markers before unleashing a powerful shot leaving no chance for bayern goalkeeper michael rensing , who got a rare chance between the posts ahead of former germany keeper oliver kahn . marius ebbers gave the home side a convincing lead in the last minute of the first half after being sent through by matthias lehmann . but bayern staged a furious comeback in the second 45 minutes and cut the difference to one goal . poldi got bayern back in game magath brought on lukas podolski in the second half for the disappointing andreas ottl and the germany striker took just two minutes to make his mark after being set up by strike partner roy makaay . podolski went into the aachen area and pushed the ball past goalkeeper stephan straub . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is n't expected to stay in aachen too much longer dutch international mark van bommel gave his side a second goal in the 68th minute with a shot from 16 meters .
bayern continued pushing forward in search of an equalizer , but that allowed aachen the opportunity to counter and jan schlaudraff , whom bayern is trying to sign , used one of the chances to put the game beyond the holders ' reach . " we were running on fumes at the end , " schlaudraff said .
" we knew it would be tough to stop bayern from showing their individual qualities and it certainly was .

" we were too convinced that we had the match under control , " he said .
" this was not the case and then we made mistakes . " both german national striker bastian schweinsteiger and dutch international roy makaay were guilty of failing to find the net in the game 's early minutes despite their team being highly favored and having the better of play . even aachen coach michael frontzeck admitted bayern were the better side in the first half and should have taken the lead . " we had three shots and made three goals , " he said " that of course is very good , but bayern were really better . " while the 20,800 fans packed into aachen 's sold-out tivoli stadium cheered their team after the final whistle , the bavarians went to the locker room with their hopes of defending the cup title for a third season quashed . " of course we are disappointed as we wanted to defend the title , " magath said .
" but we lost against a strong and fighting aachen side .

bayern continued pushing forward in search of an equalizer , but that allowed aachen the opportunity to counter and jan schlaudraff , whom bayern is trying to sign , used one of the chances to put the game beyond the holders ' reach . " we were running on fumes at the end , " schlaudraff said .

if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .
" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year . " we must have a global approach for a global problem , " bisignani said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .

instead , it will pursue a national project aimed at tackling us dominance in the information sector . less than a year after french president jacques chirac hailed quaero as europe 's answer to the challenge posed by " american giants google and yahoo , " the ambitious project seems to have fallen by the wayside . germany will now work on its own search engine program named theseus after a legendary greek hero who found his way out of the labyrinth of the monster minotaur . " we will still see cooperation , but in another form , such as work groups , " hendrik luchtmeier , a spokesman for germany 's economics ministry , told idg news service .
" the consortium between the german and french governments is over . " division of labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll all fit together somehow , experts say but hendrik speck , a professor of digital media at the university of applied sciences kaiserslautern , described the move as a division of labor . " france is concentrating more on developing a search engine while the german project promotes innovative core technologies , " he said . luchtmeier declined to comment on the reasons why germany had decided to drop the joint venture , according to idg .
but he said that unlike quaero , theseus would not actually work on developing a search engine and instead back companies and organizations that conduct research in areas including search-technology research and advanced communication networks . luchtmeier did not say how much money germany will set aside for the project , but the government announced monday that it will set aside 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- . catching up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , google rules the search-engine world while the german effort might still pale in comparison to the huge research funds available at google , experts said that it was important to take a first step . " it does n't take a lot of money to set up a know-how infrastructure that 's missing in germany , " said wolfgang sander-beuermann , the head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover . he agreed with speck that the two separate projects were still viable and could even produce better results than a joint venture .
sander-beuermann also added that disagreements between companies involved in the franco-german cooperation might have played a role in the split . " it could be that the partners were fighting and decided that it 's better if each side does their own thing , " he said .
" it might have been similar to the situation at -lrb- european plane maker -rrb- airbus . " the important thing , sander-beuermann added , is that europe gets going in developing search-engine technology . " it 's not too late to catch up , " he said .

1 romania has prepared for its role as the european union 's new eastern border by installing a new high-tech security system on its frontier to keep non-eu citizens from entering the bloc it joins in january . at a cost of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 691 million -rrb- , the system set up by european aerospace group eads , will for the first time link all romania 's border posts to a central network and enable faster and more efficient passport checks . but analysts differ over whether the enlargement of the eu 's borders will cause a crisis as it puts the union next to romania 's poor neighbors moldova and ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarette smuggling plagues eastern european borders a french military adviser to the romanian interior ministry told the afp news service that as of 2007 " there will certainly be strong pressure by clandestine immigrants , mainly from the third world , on romania 's border . " " no migration wave " he said the immigrants would mostly come from ukraine since moldova " is the most closed and sovietized country in the region , " referring to that state 's authoritarian government . political analyst cristian pirvulescu , however , said he did not think romania 's new role as the eu 's border would set off " a wave of migration . " those who wanted to emigrate to the west from countries like moldova have already done so , pirvulescu said . in any case , romania has updated its monitoring capability .

" it is true that we are finding more and more moldavians with false romanian passports and we arrest smugglers every day , " said a security official at the albita post , which is in iasi , along the serbian-ukraine border . some 500,000 packets of cigarettes , worth an estimated 285,000 euros , were smuggled into romania between may and october . drug smuggling is down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to avoid censure , romania must comply with eu rules " at 50 cents , a packet of cigarettes in the ukraine is half as expensive as in romania , " said ilie poroch , commissioner of the radauti border post with ukraine . drug trafficking on the other hand is down : about 30 kilograms -lrb- 66 pounds -rrb- were found in 2006 , compared to 141 kilograms in 2005 . arms trafficking is also low : less than 20 firearms and a few kilograms of explosives were recovered in 2006 . smugglers of large volumes of light weapons , partly manufactured in the breakaway region of transdniestr in northern moldova , prefer to use alternative routes via the black sea and the bosporus . dw staf / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament will vote on romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 21.12.2006 eu carbon trading scheme for airlines angers us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says the scheme will cut carbon dioxide emissions from planes us officials have criticized the eu 's new plan to set emission quotas for planes by 2011 , saying that the move will undermine international efforts to limit the environmental damage caused by aviation . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .
" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year . " we must have a global approach for a global problem , " bisignani said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .

the commission said that it had concluded that the acquisition " would not significantly impede effective competition in the -lrb- eu area -rrb- or any substantial part of it . " man formally launched a hostile takeover bid for scania on nov .

" we are not surprised , " a scania spokeswoman said .

1 romania has prepared for its role as the european union 's new eastern border by installing a new high-tech security system on its frontier to keep non-eu citizens from entering the bloc it joins in january . at a cost of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 691 million -rrb- , the system set up by european aerospace group eads , will for the first time link all romania 's border posts to a central network and enable faster and more efficient passport checks . but analysts differ over whether the enlargement of the eu 's borders will cause a crisis as it puts the union next to romania 's poor neighbors moldova and ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarette smuggling plagues eastern european borders a french military adviser to the romanian interior ministry told the afp news service that as of 2007 " there will certainly be strong pressure by clandestine immigrants , mainly from the third world , on romania 's border . " " no migration wave " he said the immigrants would mostly come from ukraine since moldova " is the most closed and sovietized country in the region , " referring to that state 's authoritarian government . political analyst cristian pirvulescu , however , said he did not think romania 's new role as the eu 's border would set off " a wave of migration . " those who wanted to emigrate to the west from countries like moldova have already done so , pirvulescu said . in any case , romania has updated its monitoring capability .
border posts will now have video cameras attached to a network covering the eastern romanian border , which is over 2,070 kilometers -lrb- 1,286 miles -rrb- long . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border control is a big eu issue " we are a little worried in romania because of the poor state of the roads and the lack of computers at certain border posts , " eads global security senior vice-president markus hellenthal said . more fake passports some believe illegal immigration , especially from moldova , could well increase after romania joins the eu . " it is true that we are finding more and more moldavians with false romanian passports and we arrest smugglers every day , " said a security official at the albita post , which is in iasi , along the serbian-ukraine border . some 500,000 packets of cigarettes , worth an estimated 285,000 euros , were smuggled into romania between may and october . drug smuggling is down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to avoid censure , romania must comply with eu rules " at 50 cents , a packet of cigarettes in the ukraine is half as expensive as in romania , " said ilie poroch , commissioner of the radauti border post with ukraine . drug trafficking on the other hand is down : about 30 kilograms -lrb- 66 pounds -rrb- were found in 2006 , compared to 141 kilograms in 2005 . arms trafficking is also low : less than 20 firearms and a few kilograms of explosives were recovered in 2006 . smugglers of large volumes of light weapons , partly manufactured in the breakaway region of transdniestr in northern moldova , prefer to use alternative routes via the black sea and the bosporus . dw staf / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament will vote on romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.12.2006 german early warning system for south asia two years away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's proximity to earthquakes leaves locals with less time to react to tsunami warnings nearly two years after a tsunami swept across southern asia killing over 200,000 people , researchers in germany said it will take them two more years to implement an ambitious early warning system for the region . after describing the progress made so far , scientists from the potsdam-based geo research center said they are confident a robust warning system for the area will be up and running in 2008 . " we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .
organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes . " new radio broadcasting system planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are also working on making sure people know where to go if a warning is issued while the german scientists add more gps-fitted buoys and ocean sensors to the network , others are training local authorities and institutions in how to react on tsunami warnings . 2wcom , a private company in the northern german town of flensburg , is adapting a system of european radio signals that will be capable of breaking into radio programming to broadcast the tsunami warnings and keep the population informed about imminent danger .
the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?

" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year .

instead , it will pursue a national project aimed at tackling us dominance in the information sector . less than a year after french president jacques chirac hailed quaero as europe 's answer to the challenge posed by " american giants google and yahoo , " the ambitious project seems to have fallen by the wayside . germany will now work on its own search engine program named theseus after a legendary greek hero who found his way out of the labyrinth of the monster minotaur . " we will still see cooperation , but in another form , such as work groups , " hendrik luchtmeier , a spokesman for germany 's economics ministry , told idg news service .
" the consortium between the german and french governments is over . " division of labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll all fit together somehow , experts say but hendrik speck , a professor of digital media at the university of applied sciences kaiserslautern , described the move as a division of labor . " france is concentrating more on developing a search engine while the german project promotes innovative core technologies , " he said . luchtmeier declined to comment on the reasons why germany had decided to drop the joint venture , according to idg .
but he said that unlike quaero , theseus would not actually work on developing a search engine and instead back companies and organizations that conduct research in areas including search-technology research and advanced communication networks . luchtmeier did not say how much money germany will set aside for the project , but the government announced monday that it will set aside 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- . catching up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , google rules the search-engine world while the german effort might still pale in comparison to the huge research funds available at google , experts said that it was important to take a first step . " it does n't take a lot of money to set up a know-how infrastructure that 's missing in germany , " said wolfgang sander-beuermann , the head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover . he agreed with speck that the two separate projects were still viable and could even produce better results than a joint venture .
sander-beuermann also added that disagreements between companies involved in the franco-german cooperation might have played a role in the split . " it could be that the partners were fighting and decided that it 's better if each side does their own thing , " he said .
" it might have been similar to the situation at -lrb- european plane maker -rrb- airbus . " the important thing , sander-beuermann added , is that europe gets going in developing search-engine technology . " it 's not too late to catch up , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 21.12.2006 christmas markets mean big business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's christmas market is one of germany 's most-visited the christmas market business in germany is booming , with a record number of " weihnachtsmärkte " open around the country .
but is an increase in mass-produced wares and chain-retailers turning off visitors ? if christmas markets seem to be everywhere in germany these days , it 's because they are .
according to diverse estimates , somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 markets are open across the country - in town squares , pedestrian zones , within the walls of castles , even on cruise ships . historically , christmas markets date back to the middle ages .
they began as places for german villagers to buy and sell holiday wares and a venue for local performers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people go to the market to drink mulled wine and socialize today , the markets - generally a collection of stalls selling handicrafts and ornaments as well as snacks and beverages - are a huge tourism draw , long considered an economic factor in and of themselves . big business in the weeks leading up to the holiday , busloads full of visitors from holland , france and britain flood into major cities such as munich , frankfurt , berlin , hamburg , and düsseldorf , as well as christmas-specific hubs like nuremberg and dresden .
there , they browse the stalls , eat german specialties and drink mulled wine in an authentic , if often kitschy , holiday ambiance . according to a 2002 study by the german market sellers association , an estimated 160 million people spent some 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- at the markets ; around half of the people polled were in town specifically for the market itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden ornaments are often big sellers underlying the growth in tourism revenues is a change in the nature of the christmas market itself .
still mostly run by individual municipalities , the markets are nonetheless trading their humble-origins approach for a marketing attack worthy of big business , said peter sedlacek , a professor of economic geography at the university of jena , who recently published an in-depth study comparing the christmas markets in the eastern cities of jena and erfurt . unstoppable trend " there are christmas markets being opened with a much more professional marketing push behind them , " sedlacek said .
this includes doing targeted advertising to promote a given market , and beefing up entertainment offerings , for example . " municipalities have realized what an important source of revenue this is , " he said .
" this trend is not going to stop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand made objects - here a käthe wohlfahrt music box - are more expensive than mass-produced parallel to the overall professionalization of the markets is a trend that sees local craftsmen being nudged aside by makers of mass-produced christmas items , making it more and more difficult to distinguish between one market and another , said klaus schultheis , who runs a german web site on christmas markets . " what -lrb- the big -rrb- markets are suffering from is a product range that is really homogenous , " schultheis said .
" you can go from market to market , and always see the same things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different christmas market : cologne 's medieval bazaar the mass produced items are often made in asia or eastern europe , and can be significantly cheaper than similar items hand-made in germany .
schultheis points to the typical offering of ceramic incense burners . social event " they used to be hand made , and you had to really look and choose , " he said .
" now , there are only one or two companies who make them .
i see the same ones every time i go to one of these booths .
the hunting is completely lost , hunting for some unusual or rare gift . " the more the markets look alike , schultheis said , the more letters and e-mails he gets from consumers and editors asking for tips on unusual christmas markets .
he steers them toward " romantic markets " or smaller ones that focus on local handicrafts or a particular atmosphere . yet , shultheis said , attendance at christmas markets continues to grow – despite some dissatisfaction with the products .
the reason ? " people go after work with colleagues – its more of a social event , for them it really has nothing to do with shopping , " he said . for his part , economist sedlacek compared today 's christmas markets to the omnipresent chain of aldi supermarkets , which are known for offering a reliably steady supply of cheap , quality goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to buy a beeswax candle ?
check your local christmas market " whether you see the trend toward unified christmas markets as positive or negative really depends what you expect from a christmas market , " he said . ambiance is key in fact , sedlacek noted , the people who he polled in his studies were less concerned by what was sold at the market 's stalls than by its general ambiance . " it should be full , but not too full , " he said .
" and the quality of sound was important ; there should be music but not too loud .
the products were n't decisive .
there should just be a good program , lots to see . " his study , and others , showed food and drink booths had primary importance , as well .
according to the 2002 german market sellers study , more than 57 percent of visitors went to the christmas markets with plans to eat and drink there , but only 35 percent went intending to buy a gift . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de santa 's turning a major profit at german christmas markets some might ask , " who actually buys all this kitsch ?

but is an increase in mass-produced wares and chain-retailers turning off visitors ? if christmas markets seem to be everywhere in germany these days , it 's because they are .
according to diverse estimates , somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 markets are open across the country - in town squares , pedestrian zones , within the walls of castles , even on cruise ships . historically , christmas markets date back to the middle ages .
they began as places for german villagers to buy and sell holiday wares and a venue for local performers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people go to the market to drink mulled wine and socialize today , the markets - generally a collection of stalls selling handicrafts and ornaments as well as snacks and beverages - are a huge tourism draw , long considered an economic factor in and of themselves . big business in the weeks leading up to the holiday , busloads full of visitors from holland , france and britain flood into major cities such as munich , frankfurt , berlin , hamburg , and düsseldorf , as well as christmas-specific hubs like nuremberg and dresden .
there , they browse the stalls , eat german specialties and drink mulled wine in an authentic , if often kitschy , holiday ambiance . according to a 2002 study by the german market sellers association , an estimated 160 million people spent some 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- at the markets ; around half of the people polled were in town specifically for the market itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden ornaments are often big sellers underlying the growth in tourism revenues is a change in the nature of the christmas market itself .
still mostly run by individual municipalities , the markets are nonetheless trading their humble-origins approach for a marketing attack worthy of big business , said peter sedlacek , a professor of economic geography at the university of jena , who recently published an in-depth study comparing the christmas markets in the eastern cities of jena and erfurt . unstoppable trend " there are christmas markets being opened with a much more professional marketing push behind them , " sedlacek said .
this includes doing targeted advertising to promote a given market , and beefing up entertainment offerings , for example . " municipalities have realized what an important source of revenue this is , " he said .
" this trend is not going to stop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand made objects - here a käthe wohlfahrt music box - are more expensive than mass-produced parallel to the overall professionalization of the markets is a trend that sees local craftsmen being nudged aside by makers of mass-produced christmas items , making it more and more difficult to distinguish between one market and another , said klaus schultheis , who runs a german web site on christmas markets . " what -lrb- the big -rrb- markets are suffering from is a product range that is really homogenous , " schultheis said .
" you can go from market to market , and always see the same things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different christmas market : cologne 's medieval bazaar the mass produced items are often made in asia or eastern europe , and can be significantly cheaper than similar items hand-made in germany .
schultheis points to the typical offering of ceramic incense burners . social event " they used to be hand made , and you had to really look and choose , " he said .
" now , there are only one or two companies who make them .
i see the same ones every time i go to one of these booths .
the hunting is completely lost , hunting for some unusual or rare gift . " the more the markets look alike , schultheis said , the more letters and e-mails he gets from consumers and editors asking for tips on unusual christmas markets .
he steers them toward " romantic markets " or smaller ones that focus on local handicrafts or a particular atmosphere . yet , shultheis said , attendance at christmas markets continues to grow – despite some dissatisfaction with the products .
the reason ? " people go after work with colleagues – its more of a social event , for them it really has nothing to do with shopping , " he said . for his part , economist sedlacek compared today 's christmas markets to the omnipresent chain of aldi supermarkets , which are known for offering a reliably steady supply of cheap , quality goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to buy a beeswax candle ?
check your local christmas market " whether you see the trend toward unified christmas markets as positive or negative really depends what you expect from a christmas market , " he said . ambiance is key in fact , sedlacek noted , the people who he polled in his studies were less concerned by what was sold at the market 's stalls than by its general ambiance . " it should be full , but not too full , " he said .
" and the quality of sound was important ; there should be music but not too loud .
the products were n't decisive .
there should just be a good program , lots to see . " his study , and others , showed food and drink booths had primary importance , as well .

" we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .
organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes . " new radio broadcasting system planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are also working on making sure people know where to go if a warning is issued while the german scientists add more gps-fitted buoys and ocean sensors to the network , others are training local authorities and institutions in how to react on tsunami warnings . 2wcom , a private company in the northern german town of flensburg , is adapting a system of european radio signals that will be capable of breaking into radio programming to broadcast the tsunami warnings and keep the population informed about imminent danger .
the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

some fishing limits will be eased , others tightened under the 2007 fishing quotas . the eu tried to find a balance between protecting threatened fish without destroying the fishing industry , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg told reporters . the world wildlife fund environmental group criticized the plan , saying that ministers traded fishing quotas while ignoring the crisis facing fish .

" we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .

" seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes .

the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

" we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .

if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .
" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year .

if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .
" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year .

he added a second six minutes from the break after going around two markers before unleashing a powerful shot leaving no chance for bayern goalkeeper michael rensing , who got a rare chance between the posts ahead of former germany keeper oliver kahn . marius ebbers gave the home side a convincing lead in the last minute of the first half after being sent through by matthias lehmann . but bayern staged a furious comeback in the second 45 minutes and cut the difference to one goal . poldi got bayern back in game magath brought on lukas podolski in the second half for the disappointing andreas ottl and the germany striker took just two minutes to make his mark after being set up by strike partner roy makaay . podolski went into the aachen area and pushed the ball past goalkeeper stephan straub . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is n't expected to stay in aachen too much longer dutch international mark van bommel gave his side a second goal in the 68th minute with a shot from 16 meters .
bayern continued pushing forward in search of an equalizer , but that allowed aachen the opportunity to counter and jan schlaudraff , whom bayern is trying to sign , used one of the chances to put the game beyond the holders ' reach . " we were running on fumes at the end , " schlaudraff said .
" we knew it would be tough to stop bayern from showing their individual qualities and it certainly was .
they had chances but the difference was we took ours . " cup up for grabs as favorites watch from home with favorites bayern out the cup looks wide open particularly as werder bremen and schalke 04 , joint leaders in the league , have also been eliminated . earlier bundesliga sides hanover 96 and vfl wolfsburg made no mistakes against lower league opposition as they won their matches . hanover scored two minutes into injury time in the first half to secure a 1-0 victory against high-flying second division club msv duisburg . the only goal of the game came from a long-range effort by hanno balitsch , whose shot from 25 meters slammed into the net past goalkeeper georg koch , who should have done better though . final eight decided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg assured themselves a place among the final eight beating unterhaching in fürth , wolfsburg managed to oust the local second division club greuther fürth 3-1 .
jacek krzynowek opened the scoring for the visitors in the 17th minute , argentine diego klimowicz added a second in the 56th minute . the second division team had brief hopes of coming back into the game after midfielder stephan schröck pulled one back for the home side , but dutch striker rick hoogendorp made sure of wolfsburg 's passage into the next round with a third goal for the visitors in injury time . in an all-second division clash kickers offenbach beat wacker burghausen 2-1 with a last-gasp goal scored by dino toppmöller .
offenbach , whose last appearance in the quarter-finals of the german cup dates back 16 years , is the only second division club in the round of the last eight . on tuesday , vfb stuttgart advanced with a 4-1 victory at vfl bochum , while eintracht frankfurt beat cologne 3-1 after extra time . nuremberg needed four saves by their second choice goalkeeper to beat second division spvgg unterhaching 2-1 on penalties , while hertha berlin won 3-0 at third division vfl osnabrueck . the quarter-finals will be played on feb .

the commission said that it had concluded that the acquisition " would not significantly impede effective competition in the -lrb- eu area -rrb- or any substantial part of it . " man formally launched a hostile takeover bid for scania on nov .
20 , offering 51.29 euros -lrb- $ 67.42 -rrb- per share or 10.2 billion euros in all . the german truck giant originally gave scania shareholders until dec .
11 to accept the terms , but has extended the deadline until jan .
31 , 2007 .
the scania board and the company 's key swedish shareholders have firmly rejected the man offer , saying it undervalued scania . kroes is " satisfied " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes competition commissioner neelie kroes said she was " satisfied that competition on price and technology will remain strong in the future on the bus and truck markets , in particular considering the increasing importance of environmentally-friendly technologies in this sector . " the merged entity would still face strong competition from other important manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler , volvo , iveco and daf . scania keeps resisting after the announcement , scania said it would continue to resist the takeover and the ruling would not influence its opposition . " we are not surprised , " a scania spokeswoman said .
" but the eu has now taken a stance on the market concentration issue .
the okay by the commission is linked to the fact that scania and man are strong in different regions of europe . " vw mulls future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what role will vw play ?
complicating the rancorous takeover battle are signs that scania 's biggest shareholder , german-based carmaker volkswagen ag , has been weighing up whether to try to orchestrate a three-way merger between man , scania and vw 's truck operations . but vw , which is also europe 's biggest automaker , has said that no concrete plan for a three-way merger existed .
with a 34-per-cent stake , vw is also man 's largest shareholder . " in the case of an apparent failure of the bid , volkswagen will keep all alternative possibilities open , " the vw board said at the end of a meeting last month . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw blazing new trails with winterkorn behind the wheel the volkswagen board announced friday that audi head martin winterkorn will take over the corporation in the new year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 21.12.2006 german early warning system for south asia two years away großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's proximity to earthquakes leaves locals with less time to react to tsunami warnings nearly two years after a tsunami swept across southern asia killing over 200,000 people , researchers in germany said it will take them two more years to implement an ambitious early warning system for the region . after describing the progress made so far , scientists from the potsdam-based geo research center said they are confident a robust warning system for the area will be up and running in 2008 . " we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .
organizers said they expect indonesia to run and pay for the system to warn locals of future killer waves by 2010 . faster and more accurate than us system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german system should give people more time to react to warnings after initial problems in coordination , the system is now capable of evaluating whether an underwater earthquake will produce a tsunami in five minutes , said rolf emmermann , head of the consortium of researchers behind the system , adding that he wants to cut that span down to three minutes . thomas rachel , an under-secretary in the german ministry for education and research , described the whole network of equipment as a multi-layer system that would be the most reliable ever developed . " seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes . " new radio broadcasting system planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are also working on making sure people know where to go if a warning is issued while the german scientists add more gps-fitted buoys and ocean sensors to the network , others are training local authorities and institutions in how to react on tsunami warnings . 2wcom , a private company in the northern german town of flensburg , is adapting a system of european radio signals that will be capable of breaking into radio programming to broadcast the tsunami warnings and keep the population informed about imminent danger .
the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

the commission said that it had concluded that the acquisition " would not significantly impede effective competition in the -lrb- eu area -rrb- or any substantial part of it . " man formally launched a hostile takeover bid for scania on nov .

the scania board and the company 's key swedish shareholders have firmly rejected the man offer , saying it undervalued scania . kroes is " satisfied " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes competition commissioner neelie kroes said she was " satisfied that competition on price and technology will remain strong in the future on the bus and truck markets , in particular considering the increasing importance of environmentally-friendly technologies in this sector . " the merged entity would still face strong competition from other important manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler , volvo , iveco and daf . scania keeps resisting after the announcement , scania said it would continue to resist the takeover and the ruling would not influence its opposition . " we are not surprised , " a scania spokeswoman said .
" but the eu has now taken a stance on the market concentration issue .
the okay by the commission is linked to the fact that scania and man are strong in different regions of europe . " vw mulls future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what role will vw play ?
complicating the rancorous takeover battle are signs that scania 's biggest shareholder , german-based carmaker volkswagen ag , has been weighing up whether to try to orchestrate a three-way merger between man , scania and vw 's truck operations . but vw , which is also europe 's biggest automaker , has said that no concrete plan for a three-way merger existed .
with a 34-per-cent stake , vw is also man 's largest shareholder . " in the case of an apparent failure of the bid , volkswagen will keep all alternative possibilities open , " the vw board said at the end of a meeting last month . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw blazing new trails with winterkorn behind the wheel the volkswagen board announced friday that audi head martin winterkorn will take over the corporation in the new year .

if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .
" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year . " we must have a global approach for a global problem , " bisignani said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.12.2006 germany pulls away from quaero search-engine project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet users will continue googling as usual germany has taken a new tack in its plans to develop an internet search engine with france .
instead , it will pursue a national project aimed at tackling us dominance in the information sector . less than a year after french president jacques chirac hailed quaero as europe 's answer to the challenge posed by " american giants google and yahoo , " the ambitious project seems to have fallen by the wayside . germany will now work on its own search engine program named theseus after a legendary greek hero who found his way out of the labyrinth of the monster minotaur . " we will still see cooperation , but in another form , such as work groups , " hendrik luchtmeier , a spokesman for germany 's economics ministry , told idg news service .
" the consortium between the german and french governments is over . " division of labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll all fit together somehow , experts say but hendrik speck , a professor of digital media at the university of applied sciences kaiserslautern , described the move as a division of labor . " france is concentrating more on developing a search engine while the german project promotes innovative core technologies , " he said . luchtmeier declined to comment on the reasons why germany had decided to drop the joint venture , according to idg .
but he said that unlike quaero , theseus would not actually work on developing a search engine and instead back companies and organizations that conduct research in areas including search-technology research and advanced communication networks . luchtmeier did not say how much money germany will set aside for the project , but the government announced monday that it will set aside 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- . catching up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , google rules the search-engine world while the german effort might still pale in comparison to the huge research funds available at google , experts said that it was important to take a first step . " it does n't take a lot of money to set up a know-how infrastructure that 's missing in germany , " said wolfgang sander-beuermann , the head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover . he agreed with speck that the two separate projects were still viable and could even produce better results than a joint venture .
sander-beuermann also added that disagreements between companies involved in the franco-german cooperation might have played a role in the split . " it could be that the partners were fighting and decided that it 's better if each side does their own thing , " he said .
" it might have been similar to the situation at -lrb- european plane maker -rrb- airbus . " the important thing , sander-beuermann added , is that europe gets going in developing search-engine technology . " it 's not too late to catch up , " he said .
" but it will be soon , if nothing changes . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to boost it sector to enhance high-tech standing at germany 's first-ever it summit , german chancellor angela merkel said politicians , industry and researchers had to cooperate better in order for germany to become a world leader in the sector .

if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .
" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year .

some fishing limits will be eased , others tightened under the 2007 fishing quotas . the eu tried to find a balance between protecting threatened fish without destroying the fishing industry , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg told reporters . the world wildlife fund environmental group criticized the plan , saying that ministers traded fishing quotas while ignoring the crisis facing fish .

he worried that local stocks of cod will be so depleted that the future of beloved british fish and chips is in danger . " if the fisheries collapse then it is not just the fishermen that will suffer .
the environment will suffer as fish are brought from further a field , " whittingstall said .
" chefs and the public will suffer as we will no longer be able to find high quality , freshly-caught fish on our doorstep . " the yearly quotas have caused controversy since the eu estalished a new fisheries policy in 2003 .

" we are very well in the plan and the timetable to finish the technical installation in 2008 , and then we will have another two years of joint operation of the system with our indonesian colleagues , " jörn lauterjung , the early warning system 's project coordinator in germany , said on wednesday . berlin had earmarked 45 million euros -lrb- $ 59.4 million -rrb- for the scheme , which incorporates top-notch technology developed by german scientists .

" seismometers , buoys with ocean-floor pressure sensors and ground positioning units all work together to form a perfect match for the early warning system , " he said .
" the collected information is transferred to a data collection center in real time so that reliable simulations for earthquake scenarios can be made . " researchers said the project 's accuracy and speed of reporting would make the german system superior to an existing us model in the pacific .
but jörn lauterjung added that accuracy is n't all that counts , saying it is equally important that warnings reach locals early enough for them to react . " a major challenge we have in indonesia is that we have very short early warning times , " he said .
" the earthquakes are very near to the coastline of indonesia , and we have to do a lot of training and a lot of educating for the people in indonesia so that they can react properly to warning messages and so they know how to act if a warning comes .

the signal does assume people have radio not yet commonly available in the region , though a company official said they would cost between $ 40 and $ 60 and could be cheaper if mass-produced . a test of the early warning system will be performed next week on the catastrophe 's anniversary in bali with a second planned later in 2007 on sumatra . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 21.12.2006 eu carbon trading scheme for airlines angers us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says the scheme will cut carbon dioxide emissions from planes us officials have criticized the eu 's new plan to set emission quotas for planes by 2011 , saying that the move will undermine international efforts to limit the environmental damage caused by aviation . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies . the european commission on wednesday revealed its plan , which will make flights within the union subject to compulsory carbon-dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions trading from 2011 .
international flights arriving at or departing from eu airports would have to sign up to the scheme in 2012 . the extra year given for international flights is seen as a compromise towards the united states and asian countries which had reacted angrily to the new plans . us officials said any " non-consensual " inclusion of non-eu airlines would be illegal , adding that it would undermine , rather than support efforts to limit co2 emissions from planes . small , but significant polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other co2 producers are already required to trade emissions co2 emissions are seen as the main cause for global warming .
up to now , the air travel sector , one of europe 's main producers of carbon dioxide , has been excluded from the legislation . emissions from aviation currently account for about 3 percent of total eu greenhouse gas emissions but have increased by 87 per cent since 1990 , the commission said .
the commission said that including aviation in the carbon trading system would cut co2 emissions by 2020 by some 46 percent . the commission said that ticket prices for flights would rise slightly .
additional costs for a return flight within the eu are estimated at 9 euros -lrb- $ 11.8 -rrb- and long-haul trips up to 40 euros .
to avoid the possibility of national governments being too generous in issuing emission allowances , the commission said that it would control the allocation of permits to airlines . iata welcomes plan - with caution the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , which groups more than 260 airlines , meanwhile cautiously welcomed the plan .
iata officials said they supported the step under certain conditions , but also expressed reservations about the inclusion of non-european carriers from 2012 . iata director general giovanni bisignani said the commission had to deal with two other major issues - the eu 's fragmented air traffic control and fears that its emissions rules might be different from those set elsewhere in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does europe have too many different air traffic controllers ?
a single european sky could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent , he added . " we have 34 air traffic control centers in europe but only one in the us for a similar traffic and land size , " he said .
" this leads to inefficiencies , delays , and too much time in the air . " he also called on the eu to follow guidelines on emissions trading being drawn up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- next year . " we must have a global approach for a global problem , " bisignani said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .
-lrb- 19.12.2006 -rrb- germany supports caps on airline carbon dioxide emissions the german government supported eu plans to introduce binding climate protection guidelines for airlines and said it would address the issue after taking over the eu presidency next year .
-lrb- 05.12.2006 -rrb- commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

but is an increase in mass-produced wares and chain-retailers turning off visitors ? if christmas markets seem to be everywhere in germany these days , it 's because they are .
according to diverse estimates , somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 markets are open across the country - in town squares , pedestrian zones , within the walls of castles , even on cruise ships . historically , christmas markets date back to the middle ages .
they began as places for german villagers to buy and sell holiday wares and a venue for local performers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people go to the market to drink mulled wine and socialize today , the markets - generally a collection of stalls selling handicrafts and ornaments as well as snacks and beverages - are a huge tourism draw , long considered an economic factor in and of themselves . big business in the weeks leading up to the holiday , busloads full of visitors from holland , france and britain flood into major cities such as munich , frankfurt , berlin , hamburg , and düsseldorf , as well as christmas-specific hubs like nuremberg and dresden .
there , they browse the stalls , eat german specialties and drink mulled wine in an authentic , if often kitschy , holiday ambiance . according to a 2002 study by the german market sellers association , an estimated 160 million people spent some 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- at the markets ; around half of the people polled were in town specifically for the market itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden ornaments are often big sellers underlying the growth in tourism revenues is a change in the nature of the christmas market itself .
still mostly run by individual municipalities , the markets are nonetheless trading their humble-origins approach for a marketing attack worthy of big business , said peter sedlacek , a professor of economic geography at the university of jena , who recently published an in-depth study comparing the christmas markets in the eastern cities of jena and erfurt . unstoppable trend " there are christmas markets being opened with a much more professional marketing push behind them , " sedlacek said .
this includes doing targeted advertising to promote a given market , and beefing up entertainment offerings , for example . " municipalities have realized what an important source of revenue this is , " he said .
" this trend is not going to stop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand made objects - here a käthe wohlfahrt music box - are more expensive than mass-produced parallel to the overall professionalization of the markets is a trend that sees local craftsmen being nudged aside by makers of mass-produced christmas items , making it more and more difficult to distinguish between one market and another , said klaus schultheis , who runs a german web site on christmas markets . " what -lrb- the big -rrb- markets are suffering from is a product range that is really homogenous , " schultheis said .
" you can go from market to market , and always see the same things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different christmas market : cologne 's medieval bazaar the mass produced items are often made in asia or eastern europe , and can be significantly cheaper than similar items hand-made in germany .
schultheis points to the typical offering of ceramic incense burners . social event " they used to be hand made , and you had to really look and choose , " he said .
" now , there are only one or two companies who make them .
i see the same ones every time i go to one of these booths .
the hunting is completely lost , hunting for some unusual or rare gift . " the more the markets look alike , schultheis said , the more letters and e-mails he gets from consumers and editors asking for tips on unusual christmas markets .
he steers them toward " romantic markets " or smaller ones that focus on local handicrafts or a particular atmosphere . yet , shultheis said , attendance at christmas markets continues to grow – despite some dissatisfaction with the products .
the reason ? " people go after work with colleagues – its more of a social event , for them it really has nothing to do with shopping , " he said . for his part , economist sedlacek compared today 's christmas markets to the omnipresent chain of aldi supermarkets , which are known for offering a reliably steady supply of cheap , quality goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to buy a beeswax candle ?
check your local christmas market " whether you see the trend toward unified christmas markets as positive or negative really depends what you expect from a christmas market , " he said . ambiance is key in fact , sedlacek noted , the people who he polled in his studies were less concerned by what was sold at the market 's stalls than by its general ambiance . " it should be full , but not too full , " he said .
" and the quality of sound was important ; there should be music but not too loud .
the products were n't decisive .
there should just be a good program , lots to see . " his study , and others , showed food and drink booths had primary importance , as well .
according to the 2002 german market sellers study , more than 57 percent of visitors went to the christmas markets with plans to eat and drink there , but only 35 percent went intending to buy a gift . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de santa 's turning a major profit at german christmas markets some might ask , " who actually buys all this kitsch ? " while others wonder what the christmas market stand owners do the rest of the year .

" we were too convinced that we had the match under control , " he said .
" this was not the case and then we made mistakes . " both german national striker bastian schweinsteiger and dutch international roy makaay were guilty of failing to find the net in the game 's early minutes despite their team being highly favored and having the better of play . even aachen coach michael frontzeck admitted bayern were the better side in the first half and should have taken the lead . " we had three shots and made three goals , " he said " that of course is very good , but bayern were really better . " while the 20,800 fans packed into aachen 's sold-out tivoli stadium cheered their team after the final whistle , the bavarians went to the locker room with their hopes of defending the cup title for a third season quashed . " of course we are disappointed as we wanted to defend the title , " magath said .
" but we lost against a strong and fighting aachen side .
i think it was a terrific match and the spectators would have enjoyed it . " aachen were also responsible for doing away with the bavarians the last time they failed to win the german cup in 2004 . aachen up 3-0 at halftime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath was n't as pleased as some 20,800 fans in aachen munich were down three goals by the break as laurentiu reghecampf opened the scoring with a freekick in the 11th minute .
he added a second six minutes from the break after going around two markers before unleashing a powerful shot leaving no chance for bayern goalkeeper michael rensing , who got a rare chance between the posts ahead of former germany keeper oliver kahn . marius ebbers gave the home side a convincing lead in the last minute of the first half after being sent through by matthias lehmann . but bayern staged a furious comeback in the second 45 minutes and cut the difference to one goal . poldi got bayern back in game magath brought on lukas podolski in the second half for the disappointing andreas ottl and the germany striker took just two minutes to make his mark after being set up by strike partner roy makaay . podolski went into the aachen area and pushed the ball past goalkeeper stephan straub . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is n't expected to stay in aachen too much longer dutch international mark van bommel gave his side a second goal in the 68th minute with a shot from 16 meters .
bayern continued pushing forward in search of an equalizer , but that allowed aachen the opportunity to counter and jan schlaudraff , whom bayern is trying to sign , used one of the chances to put the game beyond the holders ' reach . " we were running on fumes at the end , " schlaudraff said .
" we knew it would be tough to stop bayern from showing their individual qualities and it certainly was .
they had chances but the difference was we took ours . " cup up for grabs as favorites watch from home with favorites bayern out the cup looks wide open particularly as werder bremen and schalke 04 , joint leaders in the league , have also been eliminated . earlier bundesliga sides hanover 96 and vfl wolfsburg made no mistakes against lower league opposition as they won their matches . hanover scored two minutes into injury time in the first half to secure a 1-0 victory against high-flying second division club msv duisburg . the only goal of the game came from a long-range effort by hanno balitsch , whose shot from 25 meters slammed into the net past goalkeeper georg koch , who should have done better though . final eight decided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg assured themselves a place among the final eight beating unterhaching in fürth , wolfsburg managed to oust the local second division club greuther fürth 3-1 .
jacek krzynowek opened the scoring for the visitors in the 17th minute , argentine diego klimowicz added a second in the 56th minute . the second division team had brief hopes of coming back into the game after midfielder stephan schröck pulled one back for the home side , but dutch striker rick hoogendorp made sure of wolfsburg 's passage into the next round with a third goal for the visitors in injury time . in an all-second division clash kickers offenbach beat wacker burghausen 2-1 with a last-gasp goal scored by dino toppmöller .
offenbach , whose last appearance in the quarter-finals of the german cup dates back 16 years , is the only second division club in the round of the last eight . on tuesday , vfb stuttgart advanced with a 4-1 victory at vfl bochum , while eintracht frankfurt beat cologne 3-1 after extra time . nuremberg needed four saves by their second choice goalkeeper to beat second division spvgg unterhaching 2-1 on penalties , while hertha berlin won 3-0 at third division vfl osnabrueck . the quarter-finals will be played on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.12.2006 germany pulls away from quaero search-engine project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet users will continue googling as usual germany has taken a new tack in its plans to develop an internet search engine with france .
instead , it will pursue a national project aimed at tackling us dominance in the information sector . less than a year after french president jacques chirac hailed quaero as europe 's answer to the challenge posed by " american giants google and yahoo , " the ambitious project seems to have fallen by the wayside . germany will now work on its own search engine program named theseus after a legendary greek hero who found his way out of the labyrinth of the monster minotaur . " we will still see cooperation , but in another form , such as work groups , " hendrik luchtmeier , a spokesman for germany 's economics ministry , told idg news service .
" the consortium between the german and french governments is over . " division of labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll all fit together somehow , experts say but hendrik speck , a professor of digital media at the university of applied sciences kaiserslautern , described the move as a division of labor . " france is concentrating more on developing a search engine while the german project promotes innovative core technologies , " he said . luchtmeier declined to comment on the reasons why germany had decided to drop the joint venture , according to idg .
but he said that unlike quaero , theseus would not actually work on developing a search engine and instead back companies and organizations that conduct research in areas including search-technology research and advanced communication networks . luchtmeier did not say how much money germany will set aside for the project , but the government announced monday that it will set aside 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- . catching up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , google rules the search-engine world while the german effort might still pale in comparison to the huge research funds available at google , experts said that it was important to take a first step . " it does n't take a lot of money to set up a know-how infrastructure that 's missing in germany , " said wolfgang sander-beuermann , the head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover . he agreed with speck that the two separate projects were still viable and could even produce better results than a joint venture .
sander-beuermann also added that disagreements between companies involved in the franco-german cooperation might have played a role in the split . " it could be that the partners were fighting and decided that it 's better if each side does their own thing , " he said .

the commission said that it had concluded that the acquisition " would not significantly impede effective competition in the -lrb- eu area -rrb- or any substantial part of it . " man formally launched a hostile takeover bid for scania on nov .
20 , offering 51.29 euros -lrb- $ 67.42 -rrb- per share or 10.2 billion euros in all . the german truck giant originally gave scania shareholders until dec .
11 to accept the terms , but has extended the deadline until jan .
31 , 2007 .
the scania board and the company 's key swedish shareholders have firmly rejected the man offer , saying it undervalued scania . kroes is " satisfied " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes competition commissioner neelie kroes said she was " satisfied that competition on price and technology will remain strong in the future on the bus and truck markets , in particular considering the increasing importance of environmentally-friendly technologies in this sector . " the merged entity would still face strong competition from other important manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler , volvo , iveco and daf . scania keeps resisting after the announcement , scania said it would continue to resist the takeover and the ruling would not influence its opposition . " we are not surprised , " a scania spokeswoman said .
" but the eu has now taken a stance on the market concentration issue .
the okay by the commission is linked to the fact that scania and man are strong in different regions of europe . " vw mulls future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what role will vw play ?
complicating the rancorous takeover battle are signs that scania 's biggest shareholder , german-based carmaker volkswagen ag , has been weighing up whether to try to orchestrate a three-way merger between man , scania and vw 's truck operations . but vw , which is also europe 's biggest automaker , has said that no concrete plan for a three-way merger existed .
with a 34-per-cent stake , vw is also man 's largest shareholder . " in the case of an apparent failure of the bid , volkswagen will keep all alternative possibilities open , " the vw board said at the end of a meeting last month . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw blazing new trails with winterkorn behind the wheel the volkswagen board announced friday that audi head martin winterkorn will take over the corporation in the new year .

instead , it will pursue a national project aimed at tackling us dominance in the information sector . less than a year after french president jacques chirac hailed quaero as europe 's answer to the challenge posed by " american giants google and yahoo , " the ambitious project seems to have fallen by the wayside . germany will now work on its own search engine program named theseus after a legendary greek hero who found his way out of the labyrinth of the monster minotaur . " we will still see cooperation , but in another form , such as work groups , " hendrik luchtmeier , a spokesman for germany 's economics ministry , told idg news service .
" the consortium between the german and french governments is over . " division of labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 'll all fit together somehow , experts say but hendrik speck , a professor of digital media at the university of applied sciences kaiserslautern , described the move as a division of labor . " france is concentrating more on developing a search engine while the german project promotes innovative core technologies , " he said . luchtmeier declined to comment on the reasons why germany had decided to drop the joint venture , according to idg .
but he said that unlike quaero , theseus would not actually work on developing a search engine and instead back companies and organizations that conduct research in areas including search-technology research and advanced communication networks . luchtmeier did not say how much money germany will set aside for the project , but the government announced monday that it will set aside 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- . catching up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , google rules the search-engine world while the german effort might still pale in comparison to the huge research funds available at google , experts said that it was important to take a first step . " it does n't take a lot of money to set up a know-how infrastructure that 's missing in germany , " said wolfgang sander-beuermann , the head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover . he agreed with speck that the two separate projects were still viable and could even produce better results than a joint venture .
sander-beuermann also added that disagreements between companies involved in the franco-german cooperation might have played a role in the split . " it could be that the partners were fighting and decided that it 's better if each side does their own thing , " he said .
" it might have been similar to the situation at -lrb- european plane maker -rrb- airbus . " the important thing , sander-beuermann added , is that europe gets going in developing search-engine technology . " it 's not too late to catch up , " he said .
" but it will be soon , if nothing changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 21.12.2006 christmas markets mean big business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's christmas market is one of germany 's most-visited the christmas market business in germany is booming , with a record number of " weihnachtsmärkte " open around the country .
but is an increase in mass-produced wares and chain-retailers turning off visitors ? if christmas markets seem to be everywhere in germany these days , it 's because they are .
according to diverse estimates , somewhere between 2,500 and 3,500 markets are open across the country - in town squares , pedestrian zones , within the walls of castles , even on cruise ships . historically , christmas markets date back to the middle ages .
they began as places for german villagers to buy and sell holiday wares and a venue for local performers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people go to the market to drink mulled wine and socialize today , the markets - generally a collection of stalls selling handicrafts and ornaments as well as snacks and beverages - are a huge tourism draw , long considered an economic factor in and of themselves . big business in the weeks leading up to the holiday , busloads full of visitors from holland , france and britain flood into major cities such as munich , frankfurt , berlin , hamburg , and düsseldorf , as well as christmas-specific hubs like nuremberg and dresden .
there , they browse the stalls , eat german specialties and drink mulled wine in an authentic , if often kitschy , holiday ambiance . according to a 2002 study by the german market sellers association , an estimated 160 million people spent some 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- at the markets ; around half of the people polled were in town specifically for the market itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden ornaments are often big sellers underlying the growth in tourism revenues is a change in the nature of the christmas market itself .
still mostly run by individual municipalities , the markets are nonetheless trading their humble-origins approach for a marketing attack worthy of big business , said peter sedlacek , a professor of economic geography at the university of jena , who recently published an in-depth study comparing the christmas markets in the eastern cities of jena and erfurt . unstoppable trend " there are christmas markets being opened with a much more professional marketing push behind them , " sedlacek said .
this includes doing targeted advertising to promote a given market , and beefing up entertainment offerings , for example . " municipalities have realized what an important source of revenue this is , " he said .
" this trend is not going to stop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand made objects - here a käthe wohlfahrt music box - are more expensive than mass-produced parallel to the overall professionalization of the markets is a trend that sees local craftsmen being nudged aside by makers of mass-produced christmas items , making it more and more difficult to distinguish between one market and another , said klaus schultheis , who runs a german web site on christmas markets . " what -lrb- the big -rrb- markets are suffering from is a product range that is really homogenous , " schultheis said .
" you can go from market to market , and always see the same things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a different christmas market : cologne 's medieval bazaar the mass produced items are often made in asia or eastern europe , and can be significantly cheaper than similar items hand-made in germany .
schultheis points to the typical offering of ceramic incense burners . social event " they used to be hand made , and you had to really look and choose , " he said .
" now , there are only one or two companies who make them .
i see the same ones every time i go to one of these booths .
the hunting is completely lost , hunting for some unusual or rare gift . " the more the markets look alike , schultheis said , the more letters and e-mails he gets from consumers and editors asking for tips on unusual christmas markets .
he steers them toward " romantic markets " or smaller ones that focus on local handicrafts or a particular atmosphere . yet , shultheis said , attendance at christmas markets continues to grow – despite some dissatisfaction with the products .
the reason ? " people go after work with colleagues – its more of a social event , for them it really has nothing to do with shopping , " he said . for his part , economist sedlacek compared today 's christmas markets to the omnipresent chain of aldi supermarkets , which are known for offering a reliably steady supply of cheap , quality goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to buy a beeswax candle ?
check your local christmas market " whether you see the trend toward unified christmas markets as positive or negative really depends what you expect from a christmas market , " he said . ambiance is key in fact , sedlacek noted , the people who he polled in his studies were less concerned by what was sold at the market 's stalls than by its general ambiance . " it should be full , but not too full , " he said .
" and the quality of sound was important ; there should be music but not too loud .
the products were n't decisive .
there should just be a good program , lots to see . " his study , and others , showed food and drink booths had primary importance , as well .
according to the 2002 german market sellers study , more than 57 percent of visitors went to the christmas markets with plans to eat and drink there , but only 35 percent went intending to buy a gift . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : santa 's turning a major profit at german christmas markets some might ask , " who actually buys all this kitsch ?

the trade surplus leapt by 54.1 % in the month from a year earlier to 915.9bn yen -lrb- $ 7.76bn ; £ 4bn -rrb- .
economists had been expecting the world 's second-largest economy to record a more modest rise in the trade surplus of just under 3 % .
the government figures follow a 25.3 % fall in the surplus during october .
economic trend imports into japan in november rose by 7.5 % to 5.72 trillion yen , lifted by higher raw material costs , the ministry of finance said .
but strong growth in sales of shipments of cars , steel and electronic items pushed japanese exports up by 12.1 % to 6.63 trillion yen .
" the trade surplus was bigger than expected as exports were stronger than we thought , " said yasuo yamamoto , a senior economist at mizuho research institute .
" the data showed imports of crude oil fell while exports remained firm .
as crude oil prices continue to decline , this trend may be here to stay for a while . "
shipments of goods to the us rose by 8.6 % from the previous year to 1.51 trillion yen , while exports to china rose by 19.5 % to 998.1bn yen , the government said .

statues and portraits of the self-styled turkmenbashi , father of the turkmen , were erected everywhere .
cities , airports and even a meteorite were named after him .
he introduced increasingly personal laws , and a book he wrote to be a " spiritual guide " for the nation was made required reading .
it was , say analysts , one of the most authoritarian regimes in the world .
president niyazov tolerated no dissent , and there is no political opposition and free media .
many opponents fled abroad to highlight the abuses .
an alleged assassination attempt in 2002 was used by the president to crush his few remaining opponents , drawing condemnation from human rights groups and the us government .
president niyazov had long suffered from heart problems , publicly acknowledging for the first time in november 2006 that he had heart disease .
bizarre laws saparmurat niyazov was born in 1940 but orphaned at an early age , growing up in a state orphanage .
his father died in wwii and his mother was killed in the earthquake that devastated turkmenistan 's capital in 1948 .
turkmen propaganda was later to make much of these humble beginnings .
the young niyazov rose quickly up the communist party ladder , becoming first secretary of then soviet turkmenistan at the age of 45 .
he became president after the transition to independence in 1991 , adopting the title turkmenbashi .
he became president for life in 1999 .
his influence spilled over into every sphere of turkmen life .
even the months and days of the week were named after himself and his family .
when he gave up smoking after major heart surgery in 1997 , he ordered all his ministers to do the same and banned smoking in public places .
he later declared a ban on young men wearing beards and long hair .
opera , ballet , listening to car radios and the playing of recorded music on television and at public events was forbidden .
his book , the ruhnama - a collection of his thoughts on turkmen identity , history and destiny - was put on the curriculum of schools and universities .
president niyazov was accused of spending more money on his grandiose projects - such as a huge man-made lake in the kara kum desert , and an ice palace in the capital ashgabat - than on social welfare .
his legacy is grim , say analysts .
despite the central asian 's state rich energy resources , the country is mired in poverty - with crumbling education , health and social systems .

does niyazov 's death come as a surprise ?
it certainly does .
there have been rumours for quite some time that his health has been failing , but the assumption has always been that he had the means and the doctors to keep him going .
he was a very authoritarian leader .
had he named a successor ?
niyazov was pretty much the state , and what he decreed on any subject - politics , culture , science - was very much the law .
no permission has been granted for any kind of independent political institutions , there have been no opportunities at all for them to develop , and there is no designated successor .
given that he styled himself the father of the nation , will his death have any psychological effect ?
absolutely .
there is an entire generation that has been brought up in this spirit .
but at the same time there 's an older generation who do remember what life was like before niyazov came to power , and do have a somewhat different vision of how things could be .
but certainly , for a great proportion of the population , this will come as a great blow .
what does his death mean for the rest of the world ?
you have to keep in mind that turkmenistan has massive reserves of natural gas , which a number of countries have been competing to get access to , including russia and china .
so i think there will be a certain scramble for influence with whatever government might emerge .
is there a risk of political instability ?
well it 's very difficult to say .
but certainly there have been growing fears over the last few years that any abrupt removal of niyazov could lead to a power struggle between representatives of different regions and different clans , which - in the worst case scenario - could lead to civil war or to a failed state .
but at this stage , given the lack of reliable information about the internal political structure , it 's very difficult to say , but i do think there is cause for concern .
will turkmenistan 's foreign policies now change ?
niyazov seems to have taken the idea of neutrality as maintaining pretty much the minimum relations with everybody .
it 's difficult to say in what direction the country will head now .
how will the death affect the rest of central asia ?
all the countries in central asia are closely connected .
instability in one country can easily affect instability in other countries .
if there is instability or conflict in turkmenistan , this could have very serious consequences for neighbouring states , particularly uzbekistan .

he was a very authoritarian leader .
had he named a successor ?
niyazov was pretty much the state , and what he decreed on any subject - politics , culture , science - was very much the law .
no permission has been granted for any kind of independent political institutions , there have been no opportunities at all for them to develop , and there is no designated successor .
given that he styled himself the father of the nation , will his death have any psychological effect ?
absolutely .
there is an entire generation that has been brought up in this spirit .
but at the same time there 's an older generation who do remember what life was like before niyazov came to power , and do have a somewhat different vision of how things could be .
but certainly , for a great proportion of the population , this will come as a great blow .
what does his death mean for the rest of the world ?
you have to keep in mind that turkmenistan has massive reserves of natural gas , which a number of countries have been competing to get access to , including russia and china .
so i think there will be a certain scramble for influence with whatever government might emerge .
is there a risk of political instability ?
well it 's very difficult to say .
but certainly there have been growing fears over the last few years that any abrupt removal of niyazov could lead to a power struggle between representatives of different regions and different clans , which - in the worst case scenario - could lead to civil war or to a failed state .
but at this stage , given the lack of reliable information about the internal political structure , it 's very difficult to say , but i do think there is cause for concern .
will turkmenistan 's foreign policies now change ?
niyazov seems to have taken the idea of neutrality as maintaining pretty much the minimum relations with everybody .
it 's difficult to say in what direction the country will head now .
how will the death affect the rest of central asia ?
all the countries in central asia are closely connected .
instability in one country can easily affect instability in other countries .
if there is instability or conflict in turkmenistan , this could have very serious consequences for neighbouring states , particularly uzbekistan .

ryanair 's offer for aer lingus has now lapsed but it said it would make a new bid if brussels approves the deal .
brussels said the deal would " raise serious competition concerns " for passengers and may push up fares .
ryanair said fares would fall as a result and accused brussels of an " inconsistent " approach to the issue .
still confident ryanair boss michael o 'leary said he was " disappointed " by the decision , which will delay a ruling on the deal until may .
but he added : " ryanair remains confident that its offer , which is consistent with the competition commission 's stated policy on airline consolidation , will win eu competition approval . "
brussels said initial measures proposed by ryanair to counter concerns about the impact of the deal on competition and prices were inadequate .
based on takeover rules , all acceptances of ryanair 's offer received to date become void effective immediately .
ryanair will need approval by the takeover panel to make another offer next year .
ryanair , which recently increased its stake in aer lingus to 25 % , defended its bid saying it would lead to lower aer lingus fares and fuel surcharges , maintain aer lingus as a separate , stand-alone airline and retain its brand .
the irish government , which holds some 25 % of aer lingus shares , has stated it would not sell its stake , voicing concerns over the impact such a deal could have on aer lingus jobs .
it and other investors have said ryanair 's offer undervalues the firm .
together , aer lingus and ryanair operate most flights in and out of ireland .

but he added : " ryanair remains confident that its offer , which is consistent with the competition commission 's stated policy on airline consolidation , will win eu competition approval . "
brussels said initial measures proposed by ryanair to counter concerns about the impact of the deal on competition and prices were inadequate .
aer lingus says it will co-operate with the commission in its enquiry based on takeover rules , all acceptances of ryanair 's offer received to date become void effective immediately .
ryanair will need approval by the takeover panel to make another offer next year .
ryanair , which recently increased its stake in aer lingus to 25 % , defended its bid saying it would lead to lower aer lingus fares and fuel surcharges , maintain aer lingus as a separate , stand-alone airline and retain its brand .
the irish government , which holds some 25 % of aer lingus shares , has stated it would not sell its stake , voicing concerns over the impact such a deal could have on aer lingus jobs .
it and other investors have said ryanair 's offer undervalues the firm .
together , aer lingus and ryanair operate most flights in and out of ireland .

the ruling effectively clears the 68-year-old cleric of involvement in the deadly nightclub attacks .
ba 'asyir was released in june after serving 26 months in jail .
but despite his claims of innocence , some security experts still insist he was a founding member of regional islamic militant group jemaah islamiah .
conspiracy charges ba 'asyir was first arrested shortly after the bali nightclub bombings in october 2002 , although he was never accused of actually taking part in the attack .
the two bombs ripped through the kuta area of bali , a regular haunt for tourists , destroying a nightclub and killing mainly foreigners .
ba 'asyir was held in custody and faced two separate trials , eventually serving two separate sentences , the first for minor immigration offences , the second for being part of what the court called an " evil conspiracy " .
in both cases more serious charges were either dropped or later overturned on appeal .
now the conspiracy charges have also been dropped , as a result of an appeal filed during ba 'asyir 's imprisonment .
" thank god the supreme court has finally revealed the final truth , " the cleric 's son , abdurrahmin , told the associated press on thursday .
but some indonesian and foreign intelligence agencies still believe ba 'asyir was , and perhaps still is , the spiritual leader of radical network jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- .
as a charismatic preacher and teacher , he is thought to have provided encouragement - and some would argue ideological justification - for violence .
members of ji are accused of being behind a number of operations in indonesia , including two suicide attacks in jakarta and the 2002 and 2005 bali bombings .
but most of these attacks took place while ba 'asyir was in prison , and he has always denied that ji even exists .

rates were held at 5 % last month but inflation still remains above the government 's 2 % target .

after negotiating with site-managers english heritage , the crowd performed traditional solstice activities on thursday morning , and left peacefully .
one reveller , who wished to remain anonymous , said : " we formed a ring and held hands , and touched the stones .
the man with the green cloak was there .
" but there were an awful lot of red faces , " she said .
the pagan celebration of winter solstice is one of the oldest winter celebrations in the world .
people assume because the summer solstice is the 21st june , the winter solstice will be the 21st december english heritage the solstice is actually at 0022 gmt on friday , and some crowds are expected at stonehenge on friday morning .
" i do n't know if i 'll go back , " the reveller said .
a spokeswoman for english heritage , which looks after the site , said : " people assume because the summer solstice is the 21st june , the winter solstice will be the 21st december .
" they should always check . "
stonehenge is currently competing against other iconic buildings and structures , ranging from the statue of liberty to the great wall of china , in a global hunt for the new seven wonders of the world .
the poll is being organised by the swiss-based group new7wonders and the winners will be announced in july 2007 .

on thursday , bangkok 's set stock index fell 2.4 % .
it had plunged 15 % on tuesday but rebounded 11 % on wednesday .
the thai baht fell 1.7 % against the us dollar on thursday , the biggest decline in three years .
the volatility followed central bank plans to limit the amount of money that could be withdrawn by investors .
the recent upheaval has reminded investors of the 1997 asian financial crisis , when huge outflows of foreign funds - initially from thailand - led to regional market collapse .
' definitely hurts ' the central bank 's plans were aimed at limiting the gains in the baht , which has been one of the best-performing asian currencies this year and whose strength has been blamed for a drop exports .
foreign investors were told that they would only be able to invest 70 % of money brought into the country , and would only be able to recoup the full amount if they left it in the country for a year .
this prompted a sell-off in stocks that gave the set index its worst day in 16 years , and shook markets across asia . "
the policy is clear that we do n't want to see the baht rise too much , as it would effect the overall economy " prime minister surayud chulanont the size of the reaction shocked thai authorities and in an effort to halt the slump , finance minister pridiyathorn devakula said on wednesday that foreigners would be able to trade equities free of the restrictions .
the restrictions still apply to overseas investments in bonds .
investors called the move misguided , and said it highlighted a lack of market understanding in thailand , which has been ruled by an interim government since a military coup in september .
" it definitely hurts thailand 's standing with the international investor community , " said marco sucharitkul , president of jp morgan securities in thailand .
" foreign investors will remain wary of thai monetary and economic policies for the next few months .
it does not help that the government was appointed by military coup makers , " he said .
' flip-flopping ' uncertainty about the future resurfaced on thursday after prime minister surayud chulanont and his finance minister both said they supported the bank of thailand 's moves to control the baht despite tweaking its plans .
" the policy is n't flip-flopping , " the prime minister said .
" there has been no change in policy .
the policy is clear that we do n't want to see the baht rise too much , as it would effect the overall economy . "
finance minister devakula said that : " there was no point being stubborn about it .
if we stuck to what we announced at first , it may have caused more damage .
" for the country , i am alright with losing a little bit of face , " he said .
the thai baht fell to 36.42 against the us dollar on thursday , trimming its gains for the year to 12 % .
thai officials have said that they want to see the baht trading no stronger than 35 against the dollar .
the central bank said on thursday that the currency controls would be lifted once the baht stabilises .
