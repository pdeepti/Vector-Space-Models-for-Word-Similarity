italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 07.04.2006 italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is not considered a great communicator italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister . italians affectionately call him " the professor " and appreciate his level-headedness .
his fans are captivated by his knowledge and expertise .
romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .
he was born on aug .
9 , 1939 as the eighth of nine children in scandiano , italy 's " red " emilia-romagna region long administered by communists .
his father was an engineer , his mother , a teacher .
prodi married flavia prodi franzoni , a university teacher , in 1969 .
the couple have two sons .
" i like being in the midst of a lot of people - there are 55 of us altogether in my family . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi on an italian state television talk show after graduation from high school , prodi took a degree in law with distinction in 1961 and then pursued postgraduate studies at the renowned london school of economics .
from 1963-1969 , he was assistant professor , then professor of industrial organization and industrial policy at the university of bologna . getting italy euro-ready prodi entered politics at the end of the 1970s as a non-partisan and was appointed industry minister in giulio andreotti 's government . the economics expert made a name for himself as chairman and reorganizer of the state-run holding company called the institute for industrial reconstruction -lrb- iri -rrb- , preparing the company for privatization . prodi made the leap to political power in 1996 when he founded the ulivo -lrb- olive tree -rrb- center-left coalition .
he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .
the leftist coalition had to withstand several crises , reorganized the government and , in 2001 , lost in parliamentary elections to silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition . unfilled expectations in brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to govern italy romano prodi was faced with a new political challenge in 1999 .
european commission members had collectively resigned in march due to allegations of fraud , mismanagement and nepotism in the eu 's executive body .
prodi took up the post of president of the european commission that year - which he held until 2004 - with high hopes of sweeping reforms . yet the politician who had earned his laurels early on had a hard time fulfilling the high expectations in brussels .
even before he moved to the eu capital , he had been dubbed a " tender power player " in rome .
prodi was not the eloquent , " great communicator " necessary for conveying the idea of europe and mediating between eu member states . calls for resignation in 2002 , prodi reaped europe-wide dissatisfaction and hardly concealed calls for his resignation when he described the european stability and growth pact - the rules that underpin the euro - as " dumb " and demanded a more flexible plan .
as commission president , his remarks compromised his own institution 's credibility and capacity to act .
financial inconsistencies at the european statistics agency eurostat in 2003 also did not reflect well on prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not always popular as european commission president during prodi 's tenure as head of the commission the eu grew to include 10 mainly former communist countries .
the back and forth over the bloc 's first constitution also took off .
though all eu member states signed the draft constitution , its future has been in doubt ever since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it . difficult departure prodi did n't gain much support from the european council for a second term .
he had already been vehemently criticized for his publication europe : the dream and the choices , which many considered to be more of a report on italian domestic policies rather a discussion of european topics .
prodi was accused of abusing his power as head of the commission to pursue his political career in italy .
the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that despite hostilities and predictions that he would leave office prematurely , prodi " displayed a great deal of staying power , " yet also left behind the impression that he was a man who " tended to go it alone and who lacked trust in his instincts . " a return to italian politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forever at odds : silvio berlusconi and romano prodi in contrast to silvio berlusconi , prodi has been rather modest during his campaign appearances in italy .
he has focused on facts and arguments rather than appearances , stressing that he will get italy back on track .
he 's counting on italians ' trust in his capabilities .
he has said the country must overcome its recession and tackle its oppressive budget deficit .
and he has been critical of the current government : " in the past few years , the rich have got richer , the poor , poorer . "
prodi has said promising to develop the country 's economically weak south . romano prodi 's reputation as a serious politician is supported by the numerous academic awards of recognition he has received from around the world and by the many reports on political economics and industrial policy he has published .
even if his style of political leadership and his ability to assert himself are debatable , he has never been involved in scandals which could compromise his credibility and incorruptibility . samera zagala -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 07.04.2006 italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is not considered a great communicator italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister . italians affectionately call him " the professor " and appreciate his level-headedness .
his fans are captivated by his knowledge and expertise .
romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .
he was born on aug .
9 , 1939 as the eighth of nine children in scandiano , italy 's " red " emilia-romagna region long administered by communists .
his father was an engineer , his mother , a teacher .
prodi married flavia prodi franzoni , a university teacher , in 1969 .
the couple have two sons .
" i like being in the midst of a lot of people - there are 55 of us altogether in my family . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi on an italian state television talk show after graduation from high school , prodi took a degree in law with distinction in 1961 and then pursued postgraduate studies at the renowned london school of economics .
from 1963-1969 , he was assistant professor , then professor of industrial organization and industrial policy at the university of bologna . getting italy euro-ready prodi entered politics at the end of the 1970s as a non-partisan and was appointed industry minister in giulio andreotti 's government . the economics expert made a name for himself as chairman and reorganizer of the state-run holding company called the institute for industrial reconstruction -lrb- iri -rrb- , preparing the company for privatization . prodi made the leap to political power in 1996 when he founded the ulivo -lrb- olive tree -rrb- center-left coalition .
he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .
the leftist coalition had to withstand several crises , reorganized the government and , in 2001 , lost in parliamentary elections to silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition . unfilled expectations in brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to govern italy romano prodi was faced with a new political challenge in 1999 .
european commission members had collectively resigned in march due to allegations of fraud , mismanagement and nepotism in the eu 's executive body .
prodi took up the post of president of the european commission that year - which he held until 2004 - with high hopes of sweeping reforms . yet the politician who had earned his laurels early on had a hard time fulfilling the high expectations in brussels .
even before he moved to the eu capital , he had been dubbed a " tender power player " in rome .
prodi was not the eloquent , " great communicator " necessary for conveying the idea of europe and mediating between eu member states . calls for resignation in 2002 , prodi reaped europe-wide dissatisfaction and hardly concealed calls for his resignation when he described the european stability and growth pact - the rules that underpin the euro - as " dumb " and demanded a more flexible plan .
as commission president , his remarks compromised his own institution 's credibility and capacity to act .
financial inconsistencies at the european statistics agency eurostat in 2003 also did not reflect well on prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not always popular as european commission president during prodi 's tenure as head of the commission the eu grew to include 10 mainly former communist countries .
the back and forth over the bloc 's first constitution also took off .
though all eu member states signed the draft constitution , its future has been in doubt ever since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it . difficult departure prodi did n't gain much support from the european council for a second term .
he had already been vehemently criticized for his publication europe : the dream and the choices , which many considered to be more of a report on italian domestic policies rather a discussion of european topics .
prodi was accused of abusing his power as head of the commission to pursue his political career in italy .
the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that despite hostilities and predictions that he would leave office prematurely , prodi " displayed a great deal of staying power , " yet also left behind the impression that he was a man who " tended to go it alone and who lacked trust in his instincts . " a return to italian politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forever at odds : silvio berlusconi and romano prodi in contrast to silvio berlusconi , prodi has been rather modest during his campaign appearances in italy .
he has focused on facts and arguments rather than appearances , stressing that he will get italy back on track .
he 's counting on italians ' trust in his capabilities .
he has said the country must overcome its recession and tackle its oppressive budget deficit .
and he has been critical of the current government : " in the past few years , the rich have got richer , the poor , poorer . "
prodi has said promising to develop the country 's economically weak south . romano prodi 's reputation as a serious politician is supported by the numerous academic awards of recognition he has received from around the world and by the many reports on political economics and industrial policy he has published .

he said there were more than just doubts about the legitimacy of president alexander lukashenko 's sweeping victory .
steinmeier also condemned the arrest of hundreds of opposition supporters by lukashenko 's regime in minsk .
he emphasized that the eu was weighing whether to impose trade sanctions against belarus - which the russian foreign minister described as inappropriate . " the results of the recent elections in belarus and ukraine reflect the people 's will in these two sovereign states and should be accepted as such , " lavrov said .
" other nations should display respect for the election results and see them as the basis for shaping their own relations with minsk and kiev .
everything is fine as long as the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is observed .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 07.04.2006 italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is not considered a great communicator italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister . italians affectionately call him " the professor " and appreciate his level-headedness .
his fans are captivated by his knowledge and expertise .
romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .
he was born on aug .
9 , 1939 as the eighth of nine children in scandiano , italy 's " red " emilia-romagna region long administered by communists .
his father was an engineer , his mother , a teacher .
prodi married flavia prodi franzoni , a university teacher , in 1969 .
the couple have two sons .
" i like being in the midst of a lot of people - there are 55 of us altogether in my family . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi on an italian state television talk show after graduation from high school , prodi took a degree in law with distinction in 1961 and then pursued postgraduate studies at the renowned london school of economics .
from 1963-1969 , he was assistant professor , then professor of industrial organization and industrial policy at the university of bologna . getting italy euro-ready prodi entered politics at the end of the 1970s as a non-partisan and was appointed industry minister in giulio andreotti 's government . the economics expert made a name for himself as chairman and reorganizer of the state-run holding company called the institute for industrial reconstruction -lrb- iri -rrb- , preparing the company for privatization . prodi made the leap to political power in 1996 when he founded the ulivo -lrb- olive tree -rrb- center-left coalition .
he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .
the leftist coalition had to withstand several crises , reorganized the government and , in 2001 , lost in parliamentary elections to silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition . unfilled expectations in brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to govern italy romano prodi was faced with a new political challenge in 1999 .
european commission members had collectively resigned in march due to allegations of fraud , mismanagement and nepotism in the eu 's executive body .
prodi took up the post of president of the european commission that year - which he held until 2004 - with high hopes of sweeping reforms . yet the politician who had earned his laurels early on had a hard time fulfilling the high expectations in brussels .
even before he moved to the eu capital , he had been dubbed a " tender power player " in rome .
prodi was not the eloquent , " great communicator " necessary for conveying the idea of europe and mediating between eu member states . calls for resignation in 2002 , prodi reaped europe-wide dissatisfaction and hardly concealed calls for his resignation when he described the european stability and growth pact - the rules that underpin the euro - as " dumb " and demanded a more flexible plan .
as commission president , his remarks compromised his own institution 's credibility and capacity to act .
financial inconsistencies at the european statistics agency eurostat in 2003 also did not reflect well on prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not always popular as european commission president during prodi 's tenure as head of the commission the eu grew to include 10 mainly former communist countries .
the back and forth over the bloc 's first constitution also took off .
though all eu member states signed the draft constitution , its future has been in doubt ever since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it . difficult departure prodi did n't gain much support from the european council for a second term .
he had already been vehemently criticized for his publication europe : the dream and the choices , which many considered to be more of a report on italian domestic policies rather a discussion of european topics .
prodi was accused of abusing his power as head of the commission to pursue his political career in italy .
the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that despite hostilities and predictions that he would leave office prematurely , prodi " displayed a great deal of staying power , " yet also left behind the impression that he was a man who " tended to go it alone and who lacked trust in his instincts . " a return to italian politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forever at odds : silvio berlusconi and romano prodi in contrast to silvio berlusconi , prodi has been rather modest during his campaign appearances in italy .
he has focused on facts and arguments rather than appearances , stressing that he will get italy back on track .
he 's counting on italians ' trust in his capabilities .
he has said the country must overcome its recession and tackle its oppressive budget deficit .
and he has been critical of the current government : " in the past few years , the rich have got richer , the poor , poorer . "
prodi has said promising to develop the country 's economically weak south . romano prodi 's reputation as a serious politician is supported by the numerous academic awards of recognition he has received from around the world and by the many reports on political economics and industrial policy he has published .
even if his style of political leadership and his ability to assert himself are debatable , he has never been involved in scandals which could compromise his credibility and incorruptibility . samera zagala -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped .

" " let us not aim for a zero-risk society , which would be an immobile one , but rather for a society of managed risk , " villepin said , stressing that fighting unemployment remained his government 's top priority . he announced plans to strengthen the links between business and universities to improve graduate job prospects , as well as improve worker protection and fight poverty and exclusion - seen as responsible for france 's suburban riots last year . a catalogue of failures to listen and to act conceived as a tool against youth unemployment which runs at 22 percent in france , the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . it has provoked a massive backlash from unions and students , with villepin accused of trampling on hard-won labor rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continue as the government frets over its next move more than 3,500 people have been arrested and hundreds of riot police injured in the sometimes violent protests . chirac last week offered a compromise to end the crisis - one of the worst in his 11-year presidency - by ratifying the measure , but promising a new law to amend its most contested provisions . but unions , backed by the main opposition socialist party , have demanded the cpe be abrogated entirely by april 17 , the start of parliament 's spring recess . unions want cpe dumped by parliament 's spring recess the ump has been holding a series of meetings with unions and student groups , the medef employers ' association and the cgpme small business federation , to hammer out an accord , with discussions due to wrap up on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's image - and its property - is taking a battering finance minister thierry breton said he was concerned the protests were harming france 's image abroad , although he said they had so far had no impact on the economy . meanwhile , wildcat student protests continued across the country , with hundreds of demonstrators blocking a key access road to paris ' orly airport , and others invading tracks at two main paris train stations . clashes broke out with police after crowds of several hundred students tried to break onto the capital 's ring-road . disruptions continue as threat of easter action draws near in the southwest city of toulouse , two students were injured when police moved in to clear tracks at the city 's railway station .

" " it is time to put this crisis behind us , to restore calm and unity to the country , " he added .
" the immediate priority ... is naturally appeasement . " villepin 's authority has been badly undermined in the battle over the first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- , which president jacques chirac effectively suspended at the weekend , asking for a new law to be drawn up after talks with unions . pm gets slap in the face as sarkozy handles talks responsibility for the negotiations has been handed to villepin 's powerful rival , ruling ump party chief and interior minister nicolas sarkozy , and a recent poll showed 45 percent of the public think the prime minister should step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin has conceded negotiation control to sarkozy villepin urged conciliation to end the two-month crisis after protests drew more than a million people - three million , unions said - into the streets for the second time in eight days on tuesday . he called on unions - holding a second day of talks with the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- - to " recognize that flexibility is necessary in order to provide employment for all . " " let us not aim for a zero-risk society , which would be an immobile one , but rather for a society of managed risk , " villepin said , stressing that fighting unemployment remained his government 's top priority . he announced plans to strengthen the links between business and universities to improve graduate job prospects , as well as improve worker protection and fight poverty and exclusion - seen as responsible for france 's suburban riots last year . a catalogue of failures to listen and to act conceived as a tool against youth unemployment which runs at 22 percent in france , the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . it has provoked a massive backlash from unions and students , with villepin accused of trampling on hard-won labor rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continue as the government frets over its next move more than 3,500 people have been arrested and hundreds of riot police injured in the sometimes violent protests . chirac last week offered a compromise to end the crisis - one of the worst in his 11-year presidency - by ratifying the measure , but promising a new law to amend its most contested provisions . but unions , backed by the main opposition socialist party , have demanded the cpe be abrogated entirely by april 17 , the start of parliament 's spring recess . unions want cpe dumped by parliament 's spring recess the ump has been holding a series of meetings with unions and student groups , the medef employers ' association and the cgpme small business federation , to hammer out an accord , with discussions due to wrap up on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's image - and its property - is taking a battering finance minister thierry breton said he was concerned the protests were harming france 's image abroad , although he said they had so far had no impact on the economy . meanwhile , wildcat student protests continued across the country , with hundreds of demonstrators blocking a key access road to paris ' orly airport , and others invading tracks at two main paris train stations . clashes broke out with police after crowds of several hundred students tried to break onto the capital 's ring-road . disruptions continue as threat of easter action draws near in the southwest city of toulouse , two students were injured when police moved in to clear tracks at the city 's railway station .
demonstrators also blocked access to two factories belonging to the aircraft manufacturer airbus near the city . roadblocks paralyzed traffic on the highway linking lyon with marseille on the mediterranean coast , with similar roadblocks near the western cities of nantes , rennes and lorient , limoges in central france and nancy in the east . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de easter action planned as french protestors set deadline french union and student leaders set an easter deadline wednesday for the government to repeal its youth jobs law or face a repeat of the million-strong protests that have engulfed the nation .
-lrb- april 6 , 2006 -rrb- chirac plans dismissed as france teeters on brink of anarchy trade unions and students were more determined than ever saturday to go ahead with strikes and demonstrations against a new youth jobs law despite a compromise plan by president jacques chirac aimed at defusing tensions .
-lrb- april 1 , 2006 -rrb- french protests continue after tuesday 's huge demonstrations emboldened by tuesday 's massive demonstrations , french unions are to meet with leaders from president jacques chirac 's ruling right party for talks on wednesday on the contested youth jobs law .

their appearances are likely to be televised . the panel will first meet to decide the order in which witnesses will appear . the two parties which form the current power-sharing government , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , were opposed to holding a full investigation because they believe the internal parliamentary probes answered all the relevant questions . they also fear such an inquiry could endanger the confidentiality of the secret services . opposition parties get their inquiry but the three opposition parties - the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- ; the left party ; and the greens , who were government coalition partners at the time of the iraq war - represent the quarter of seats in the 614-member chamber required to force a full inquiry . the panel consists of four christian democrats , four social democrats and one member of each of the opposition parties .

the alliance 's strategic re-deployment of troops primarily affects the new eastern european democracies which have a joint border with russia . a strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is worried about nato 's expansion to the east the german defense minister reassured his guest that nato remained absolutely committed to improving its strategic partnership with russia and had no interest whatsoever in destabilizing relations with moscow .
jung also praised russia for its recent support in a number of missions . " we 're already seeing the results of closer german-russian cooperation in the military and logistical fields , " franz josef jung said . " our joint salis transport project for instance gives us the opportunity to provide air-borne humanitarian support for earthquake victims in pakistan .

he said there were more than just doubts about the legitimacy of president alexander lukashenko 's sweeping victory .
steinmeier also condemned the arrest of hundreds of opposition supporters by lukashenko 's regime in minsk .
he emphasized that the eu was weighing whether to impose trade sanctions against belarus - which the russian foreign minister described as inappropriate . " the results of the recent elections in belarus and ukraine reflect the people 's will in these two sovereign states and should be accepted as such , " lavrov said .
" other nations should display respect for the election results and see them as the basis for shaping their own relations with minsk and kiev .
everything is fine as long as the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is observed . " lavrov suggested that any problems that had arisen with regard to belarus should be resolved not by isolating minsk , but through increased dialogue and engagement . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia 's eastward drift when britain , france and germany meet with russia over iran 's nuclear ambitions , they will be dealing with a country that has developed a new , bolder foreign policy .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .

the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .

who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .
they need n't have worried - – neither goalkeeper has spoken to the other for almost two years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi : warring keepers to be separated german national coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to keep goalkeeping rivals oliver kahn and jens lehmann apart for the next six warm-up matches to prevent further friction building up ahead of the 2006 world cup .

he said there were more than just doubts about the legitimacy of president alexander lukashenko 's sweeping victory .
steinmeier also condemned the arrest of hundreds of opposition supporters by lukashenko 's regime in minsk .
he emphasized that the eu was weighing whether to impose trade sanctions against belarus - which the russian foreign minister described as inappropriate . " the results of the recent elections in belarus and ukraine reflect the people 's will in these two sovereign states and should be accepted as such , " lavrov said .
" other nations should display respect for the election results and see them as the basis for shaping their own relations with minsk and kiev .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 07.04.2006 italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is not considered a great communicator italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister . italians affectionately call him " the professor " and appreciate his level-headedness .
his fans are captivated by his knowledge and expertise .
romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .
he was born on aug .
9 , 1939 as the eighth of nine children in scandiano , italy 's " red " emilia-romagna region long administered by communists .
his father was an engineer , his mother , a teacher .
prodi married flavia prodi franzoni , a university teacher , in 1969 .
the couple have two sons .
" i like being in the midst of a lot of people - there are 55 of us altogether in my family . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi on an italian state television talk show after graduation from high school , prodi took a degree in law with distinction in 1961 and then pursued postgraduate studies at the renowned london school of economics .
from 1963-1969 , he was assistant professor , then professor of industrial organization and industrial policy at the university of bologna . getting italy euro-ready prodi entered politics at the end of the 1970s as a non-partisan and was appointed industry minister in giulio andreotti 's government . the economics expert made a name for himself as chairman and reorganizer of the state-run holding company called the institute for industrial reconstruction -lrb- iri -rrb- , preparing the company for privatization . prodi made the leap to political power in 1996 when he founded the ulivo -lrb- olive tree -rrb- center-left coalition .
he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .
the leftist coalition had to withstand several crises , reorganized the government and , in 2001 , lost in parliamentary elections to silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition . unfilled expectations in brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to govern italy romano prodi was faced with a new political challenge in 1999 .
european commission members had collectively resigned in march due to allegations of fraud , mismanagement and nepotism in the eu 's executive body .
prodi took up the post of president of the european commission that year - which he held until 2004 - with high hopes of sweeping reforms . yet the politician who had earned his laurels early on had a hard time fulfilling the high expectations in brussels .
even before he moved to the eu capital , he had been dubbed a " tender power player " in rome .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 07.04.2006 italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is not considered a great communicator italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister . italians affectionately call him " the professor " and appreciate his level-headedness .
his fans are captivated by his knowledge and expertise .
romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .
he was born on aug .
9 , 1939 as the eighth of nine children in scandiano , italy 's " red " emilia-romagna region long administered by communists .
his father was an engineer , his mother , a teacher .
prodi married flavia prodi franzoni , a university teacher , in 1969 .
the couple have two sons .
" i like being in the midst of a lot of people - there are 55 of us altogether in my family . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi on an italian state television talk show after graduation from high school , prodi took a degree in law with distinction in 1961 and then pursued postgraduate studies at the renowned london school of economics .
from 1963-1969 , he was assistant professor , then professor of industrial organization and industrial policy at the university of bologna . getting italy euro-ready prodi entered politics at the end of the 1970s as a non-partisan and was appointed industry minister in giulio andreotti 's government . the economics expert made a name for himself as chairman and reorganizer of the state-run holding company called the institute for industrial reconstruction -lrb- iri -rrb- , preparing the company for privatization . prodi made the leap to political power in 1996 when he founded the ulivo -lrb- olive tree -rrb- center-left coalition .
he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .
the leftist coalition had to withstand several crises , reorganized the government and , in 2001 , lost in parliamentary elections to silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition . unfilled expectations in brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to govern italy romano prodi was faced with a new political challenge in 1999 .
european commission members had collectively resigned in march due to allegations of fraud , mismanagement and nepotism in the eu 's executive body .
prodi took up the post of president of the european commission that year - which he held until 2004 - with high hopes of sweeping reforms . yet the politician who had earned his laurels early on had a hard time fulfilling the high expectations in brussels .
even before he moved to the eu capital , he had been dubbed a " tender power player " in rome .
prodi was not the eloquent , " great communicator " necessary for conveying the idea of europe and mediating between eu member states . calls for resignation in 2002 , prodi reaped europe-wide dissatisfaction and hardly concealed calls for his resignation when he described the european stability and growth pact - the rules that underpin the euro - as " dumb " and demanded a more flexible plan .
as commission president , his remarks compromised his own institution 's credibility and capacity to act .
financial inconsistencies at the european statistics agency eurostat in 2003 also did not reflect well on prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not always popular as european commission president during prodi 's tenure as head of the commission the eu grew to include 10 mainly former communist countries .
the back and forth over the bloc 's first constitution also took off .
though all eu member states signed the draft constitution , its future has been in doubt ever since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it . difficult departure prodi did n't gain much support from the european council for a second term .
he had already been vehemently criticized for his publication europe : the dream and the choices , which many considered to be more of a report on italian domestic policies rather a discussion of european topics .
prodi was accused of abusing his power as head of the commission to pursue his political career in italy .
the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that despite hostilities and predictions that he would leave office prematurely , prodi " displayed a great deal of staying power , " yet also left behind the impression that he was a man who " tended to go it alone and who lacked trust in his instincts . " a return to italian politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forever at odds : silvio berlusconi and romano prodi in contrast to silvio berlusconi , prodi has been rather modest during his campaign appearances in italy .
he has focused on facts and arguments rather than appearances , stressing that he will get italy back on track .
he 's counting on italians ' trust in his capabilities .
he has said the country must overcome its recession and tackle its oppressive budget deficit .
and he has been critical of the current government : " in the past few years , the rich have got richer , the poor , poorer . "
prodi has said promising to develop the country 's economically weak south . romano prodi 's reputation as a serious politician is supported by the numerous academic awards of recognition he has received from around the world and by the many reports on political economics and industrial policy he has published .
even if his style of political leadership and his ability to assert himself are debatable , he has never been involved in scandals which could compromise his credibility and incorruptibility . samera zagala -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped .

the alliance 's strategic re-deployment of troops primarily affects the new eastern european democracies which have a joint border with russia . a strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is worried about nato 's expansion to the east the german defense minister reassured his guest that nato remained absolutely committed to improving its strategic partnership with russia and had no interest whatsoever in destabilizing relations with moscow .
jung also praised russia for its recent support in a number of missions . " we 're already seeing the results of closer german-russian cooperation in the military and logistical fields , " franz josef jung said . " our joint salis transport project for instance gives us the opportunity to provide air-borne humanitarian support for earthquake victims in pakistan .
we can now reach remote regions too .
our bilateral cooperation has also proven vital with regard to having over-flight rights from moscow for our peace-keeping mission in afghanistan , " jung said . a sore spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany reiterated its concern about the results of the elections in belarus during his visit to berlin , the russian guest and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , expressed differing opinions on the outcome of the march 19 parliamentary election in belarus . steinmeier pointed to the eu 's criticism of the elections as fraudulent .
he said there were more than just doubts about the legitimacy of president alexander lukashenko 's sweeping victory .
steinmeier also condemned the arrest of hundreds of opposition supporters by lukashenko 's regime in minsk .
he emphasized that the eu was weighing whether to impose trade sanctions against belarus - which the russian foreign minister described as inappropriate . " the results of the recent elections in belarus and ukraine reflect the people 's will in these two sovereign states and should be accepted as such , " lavrov said .
" other nations should display respect for the election results and see them as the basis for shaping their own relations with minsk and kiev .
everything is fine as long as the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is observed . " lavrov suggested that any problems that had arisen with regard to belarus should be resolved not by isolating minsk , but through increased dialogue and engagement . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia 's eastward drift when britain , france and germany meet with russia over iran 's nuclear ambitions , they will be dealing with a country that has developed a new , bolder foreign policy .

the alliance 's strategic re-deployment of troops primarily affects the new eastern european democracies which have a joint border with russia . a strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is worried about nato 's expansion to the east the german defense minister reassured his guest that nato remained absolutely committed to improving its strategic partnership with russia and had no interest whatsoever in destabilizing relations with moscow .
jung also praised russia for its recent support in a number of missions . " we 're already seeing the results of closer german-russian cooperation in the military and logistical fields , " franz josef jung said . " our joint salis transport project for instance gives us the opportunity to provide air-borne humanitarian support for earthquake victims in pakistan .
we can now reach remote regions too .
our bilateral cooperation has also proven vital with regard to having over-flight rights from moscow for our peace-keeping mission in afghanistan , " jung said . a sore spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany reiterated its concern about the results of the elections in belarus during his visit to berlin , the russian guest and his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier , expressed differing opinions on the outcome of the march 19 parliamentary election in belarus . steinmeier pointed to the eu 's criticism of the elections as fraudulent .
he said there were more than just doubts about the legitimacy of president alexander lukashenko 's sweeping victory .
steinmeier also condemned the arrest of hundreds of opposition supporters by lukashenko 's regime in minsk .
he emphasized that the eu was weighing whether to impose trade sanctions against belarus - which the russian foreign minister described as inappropriate . " the results of the recent elections in belarus and ukraine reflect the people 's will in these two sovereign states and should be accepted as such , " lavrov said .
" other nations should display respect for the election results and see them as the basis for shaping their own relations with minsk and kiev .
everything is fine as long as the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is observed . " lavrov suggested that any problems that had arisen with regard to belarus should be resolved not by isolating minsk , but through increased dialogue and engagement . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia 's eastward drift when britain , france and germany meet with russia over iran 's nuclear ambitions , they will be dealing with a country that has developed a new , bolder foreign policy .

" " it is time to put this crisis behind us , to restore calm and unity to the country , " he added .
" the immediate priority ... is naturally appeasement . " villepin 's authority has been badly undermined in the battle over the first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- , which president jacques chirac effectively suspended at the weekend , asking for a new law to be drawn up after talks with unions . pm gets slap in the face as sarkozy handles talks responsibility for the negotiations has been handed to villepin 's powerful rival , ruling ump party chief and interior minister nicolas sarkozy , and a recent poll showed 45 percent of the public think the prime minister should step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin has conceded negotiation control to sarkozy villepin urged conciliation to end the two-month crisis after protests drew more than a million people - three million , unions said - into the streets for the second time in eight days on tuesday . he called on unions - holding a second day of talks with the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- - to " recognize that flexibility is necessary in order to provide employment for all . " " let us not aim for a zero-risk society , which would be an immobile one , but rather for a society of managed risk , " villepin said , stressing that fighting unemployment remained his government 's top priority . he announced plans to strengthen the links between business and universities to improve graduate job prospects , as well as improve worker protection and fight poverty and exclusion - seen as responsible for france 's suburban riots last year . a catalogue of failures to listen and to act conceived as a tool against youth unemployment which runs at 22 percent in france , the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . it has provoked a massive backlash from unions and students , with villepin accused of trampling on hard-won labor rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continue as the government frets over its next move more than 3,500 people have been arrested and hundreds of riot police injured in the sometimes violent protests . chirac last week offered a compromise to end the crisis - one of the worst in his 11-year presidency - by ratifying the measure , but promising a new law to amend its most contested provisions . but unions , backed by the main opposition socialist party , have demanded the cpe be abrogated entirely by april 17 , the start of parliament 's spring recess . unions want cpe dumped by parliament 's spring recess the ump has been holding a series of meetings with unions and student groups , the medef employers ' association and the cgpme small business federation , to hammer out an accord , with discussions due to wrap up on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's image - and its property - is taking a battering finance minister thierry breton said he was concerned the protests were harming france 's image abroad , although he said they had so far had no impact on the economy . meanwhile , wildcat student protests continued across the country , with hundreds of demonstrators blocking a key access road to paris ' orly airport , and others invading tracks at two main paris train stations . clashes broke out with police after crowds of several hundred students tried to break onto the capital 's ring-road . disruptions continue as threat of easter action draws near in the southwest city of toulouse , two students were injured when police moved in to clear tracks at the city 's railway station .
demonstrators also blocked access to two factories belonging to the aircraft manufacturer airbus near the city . roadblocks paralyzed traffic on the highway linking lyon with marseille on the mediterranean coast , with similar roadblocks near the western cities of nantes , rennes and lorient , limoges in central france and nancy in the east . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de easter action planned as french protestors set deadline french union and student leaders set an easter deadline wednesday for the government to repeal its youth jobs law or face a repeat of the million-strong protests that have engulfed the nation .

1 at the nrw / k20 kustsammlung in the german city of düsseldorf , explores the ways in which the museum - a traditionally conservative cultural institution - has been transformed into a striking urban landmark and an exciting playground for architectural experiment . the sinuous stone , glass , and titanium curves of frank o. gerhy 's guggenheim museum in bilbao , for example , or the physical and metaphoric void which cuts across daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin , have shown that museum buildings are increasingly becoming symbols of urban identity . the düsseldorf exhibition showcases 26 impressive and forward-looking museum designs in different stages of architectural production : as models , as constructions sites or as completed buildings . experimental museums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin architects whose work is featured in the exhibition include architectural megastars such as daniel liebeskind , frank o. gehry , renzo piano or the us-austrian studio coop himmelb -lrb- l -rrb- au .
their work is documented through models , computer simulations , sketches and installations . with museums that look like anchored ships and those that are buried in the ground , or the ones that resemble gigantic aluminum tubes , the exhibition illustrates the ways in which museums have become places of experiment with form and meaning in architecture and society at large . the museums of the 21st century have very little in common with the heavy structures of the 19th century , whose goal was to inspire awe and provide a sense of cultural stability .
the museums of the future are much more fluid and playful .
in a true postmodern fashion , their visually striking forms often accentuate a society in transition or crisis of values . urban landmarks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relic from the past : the old national gallery in berlin unlike traditional museums , which were attracting visitors mainly because of the art works which were displayed in them , contemporary museums have become objects of interest on their own . the popularity of contemporary museums has a lot to do with the fact that these spectacular buildings have taken on the prominent architectural role which was once reserved for cathedrals in various european cityscapes .
but also , as armin zweite , director of the düsseldorf exhibition space k20 points out , they have become symbols of progressive thinking . " cities and states have started building new museums not necessarily in order to host grand collections , but rather to set a signal , " said zweite . the düsseldorf exhibition will be open until june 25th . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " melancholy " proves to be a powerful lure an exhibition in berlin tracing melancholy in art has surprisingly become a phenomenal success .
is it perhaps because germans are more brooding than most ?

" belarus opposition leader alexander milinkevich met with german chancellor angela merkel and other political leaders in berlin on friday , urging the eu to forgo sanctions against his country . " we are taking a very cautious stance on any plans to impose economic sanctions against belarus , " he said .
" experience has shown that economic sanctions more often than not hurt the poorest in society and affect the leadership to a far lesser degree . " ending a week-long tour of the eu , milinkevich said he was grateful for the overwhelming support he had received over the past few days from the european parliament and commission as well as from individual eu member states .
but he warned that if sanctions are imposed , the regime in minsk might effectively be able to portray itself as a martyr . " we would n't like to provide a dictator with such an opportunity , " he said .
" this is why we are in favor of limited sanctions which target only those who violate democratic laws by discriminating against whole groups of the population and subjecting them to reprisals . " travel restrictions likely germany 's christian democratic union secretary general ronald pofalla said he understood the opposition 's concerns , adding that travel restrictions for lukashenko and his ministers are a far more likely eu measure than economic sanctions .
pofalla also came out in favor of easier and less bureaucratic exchange of scientists and ngo representatives from both countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander milinkevich " people in belarus can rest assured that germany will support democratically-minded forces in their country and stand up for human rights there , " he said .
" we have also reiterated our demand to immediately release all those who were arrested by lukashenko 's regime during the peaceful protests before and after the parliamentary elections . " lukashenko 's inauguration saturday would not be accompanied by yet another round of protests in minsk because " we do n't want to see more people jailed , " milinkevich said .
" we 'll rather have to fight for the speedy release of those already in lukashenko 's prisons . " follows russian visit the opposition leader 's stop followed a two-day visit by russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , who held talks with german defense minister franz joseph jung .
the two ministers disagreed over belarus with russia expressing support for the current regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' regime is dependent on cheap russian oil on this trip , milinkevich was hesitant to openly criticize russia for its unambiguous support for lukashenko .
but he hoped that president vladimir putin would change his mind as protests against the regime in minsk were continuing unabated throughout europe . " basing the opposition 's strategy on an equation which does n't include russia just would n't work , " he says .
" it 's important to realize that without moscow 's support , the current belarusian regime would n't be able to survive for long .
besides , our coalition of opposition forces is by no means anti-russian .
we endorse good relations with our big neighbor . " meanwhile , the belarusian foreign ministry has poked fun at milinkevich 's tour of europe , saying that his post-election campaign against lukashenko is a joke .

" belarus opposition leader alexander milinkevich met with german chancellor angela merkel and other political leaders in berlin on friday , urging the eu to forgo sanctions against his country . " we are taking a very cautious stance on any plans to impose economic sanctions against belarus , " he said .
" experience has shown that economic sanctions more often than not hurt the poorest in society and affect the leadership to a far lesser degree . " ending a week-long tour of the eu , milinkevich said he was grateful for the overwhelming support he had received over the past few days from the european parliament and commission as well as from individual eu member states .
but he warned that if sanctions are imposed , the regime in minsk might effectively be able to portray itself as a martyr . " we would n't like to provide a dictator with such an opportunity , " he said .
" this is why we are in favor of limited sanctions which target only those who violate democratic laws by discriminating against whole groups of the population and subjecting them to reprisals . " travel restrictions likely germany 's christian democratic union secretary general ronald pofalla said he understood the opposition 's concerns , adding that travel restrictions for lukashenko and his ministers are a far more likely eu measure than economic sanctions .
pofalla also came out in favor of easier and less bureaucratic exchange of scientists and ngo representatives from both countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander milinkevich " people in belarus can rest assured that germany will support democratically-minded forces in their country and stand up for human rights there , " he said .
" we have also reiterated our demand to immediately release all those who were arrested by lukashenko 's regime during the peaceful protests before and after the parliamentary elections . " lukashenko 's inauguration saturday would not be accompanied by yet another round of protests in minsk because " we do n't want to see more people jailed , " milinkevich said .
" we 'll rather have to fight for the speedy release of those already in lukashenko 's prisons . " follows russian visit the opposition leader 's stop followed a two-day visit by russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , who held talks with german defense minister franz joseph jung .
the two ministers disagreed over belarus with russia expressing support for the current regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' regime is dependent on cheap russian oil on this trip , milinkevich was hesitant to openly criticize russia for its unambiguous support for lukashenko .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .

" after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .

jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .

togo : strong expat fan base czech republic : families in the fan block france : female fans in a frenzy spain : supporting diversity sports -pipe- 07.04.2006 fans of the world unite at an international congress in bonn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan leaders from around the world prepping for the world cup fan participation was the name of the game at the fans for football conference in bonn .
what expectations do fans have for the world cup ?
what events are on the game plan ?
and what fan fears need to be overcome ? soccer teams from thirty-two nations are warming up for the 2006 world cup in germany - and so are their fans .
on april 6 and 7 , fan group representatives from all over the world met in bonn at the international congress fans for football , sponsored by the friedrich ebert foundation , to share and compare how their countries will turn the cup into a festival of cultures . for kevin miles , the slogan of the 2006 world cup - " a time to make friends " - could not be more fitting .
the head of the british football supporters federation said that soccer fans in england already feel like they 've been welcomed to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin miles from the british football supporters federation " i think it is interesting to compare this slogan with the world cup in france eight years ago , " miles said .
" in 2000 , the french and british governments spent over 1.5 million british pounds -lrb- 2.15 million euros -rrb- on the advertising campaign ' no ticket , no travel ' to make sure that only british fans with stadium tickets traveled to france .
germany has invited soccer fans to participate in world cup events , whether they have tickets to a game or not . " stadium feeling on the market square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 7 million expected for public viewing events conference participants agreed that public viewing venues , i.e. big screen televisions with live game coverage set up in market squares , parks and bars throughout germany , are the key to the fans . for thomas schneider , head of the german fan coordination group kos , public viewing is a huge step forward and an enormous challenge .
" we expect over seven million fans to participate in public viewing events in the twelve world cup cities alone , " schneider said .
" so we will have fan embassies where foreign fans can get everything from accommodation information to the occasional band-aid . " fans : security risk or team player ? the idea of millions of rival soccer enthusiasts watching television in downtown munich , cologne or berlin is both exciting and a terrifying .
willy kösling , deputy head of the national security task force in the federal ministry of the interior , said that the police in germany are prepared .
" we are n't worried about the fans as a security risk , " kösling said .
" we need the fans to help deescalate the small groups of those inclined to violence .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 07.04.2006 italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is not considered a great communicator italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister . italians affectionately call him " the professor " and appreciate his level-headedness .
his fans are captivated by his knowledge and expertise .
romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .
he was born on aug .
9 , 1939 as the eighth of nine children in scandiano , italy 's " red " emilia-romagna region long administered by communists .
his father was an engineer , his mother , a teacher .
prodi married flavia prodi franzoni , a university teacher , in 1969 .
the couple have two sons .
" i like being in the midst of a lot of people - there are 55 of us altogether in my family . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi on an italian state television talk show after graduation from high school , prodi took a degree in law with distinction in 1961 and then pursued postgraduate studies at the renowned london school of economics .
from 1963-1969 , he was assistant professor , then professor of industrial organization and industrial policy at the university of bologna . getting italy euro-ready prodi entered politics at the end of the 1970s as a non-partisan and was appointed industry minister in giulio andreotti 's government . the economics expert made a name for himself as chairman and reorganizer of the state-run holding company called the institute for industrial reconstruction -lrb- iri -rrb- , preparing the company for privatization . prodi made the leap to political power in 1996 when he founded the ulivo -lrb- olive tree -rrb- center-left coalition .
he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .
the leftist coalition had to withstand several crises , reorganized the government and , in 2001 , lost in parliamentary elections to silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition . unfilled expectations in brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to govern italy romano prodi was faced with a new political challenge in 1999 .
european commission members had collectively resigned in march due to allegations of fraud , mismanagement and nepotism in the eu 's executive body .
prodi took up the post of president of the european commission that year - which he held until 2004 - with high hopes of sweeping reforms . yet the politician who had earned his laurels early on had a hard time fulfilling the high expectations in brussels .
even before he moved to the eu capital , he had been dubbed a " tender power player " in rome .
prodi was not the eloquent , " great communicator " necessary for conveying the idea of europe and mediating between eu member states . calls for resignation in 2002 , prodi reaped europe-wide dissatisfaction and hardly concealed calls for his resignation when he described the european stability and growth pact - the rules that underpin the euro - as " dumb " and demanded a more flexible plan .
as commission president , his remarks compromised his own institution 's credibility and capacity to act .
financial inconsistencies at the european statistics agency eurostat in 2003 also did not reflect well on prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not always popular as european commission president during prodi 's tenure as head of the commission the eu grew to include 10 mainly former communist countries .
the back and forth over the bloc 's first constitution also took off .
though all eu member states signed the draft constitution , its future has been in doubt ever since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it . difficult departure prodi did n't gain much support from the european council for a second term .
he had already been vehemently criticized for his publication europe : the dream and the choices , which many considered to be more of a report on italian domestic policies rather a discussion of european topics .
prodi was accused of abusing his power as head of the commission to pursue his political career in italy .
the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that despite hostilities and predictions that he would leave office prematurely , prodi " displayed a great deal of staying power , " yet also left behind the impression that he was a man who " tended to go it alone and who lacked trust in his instincts . " a return to italian politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forever at odds : silvio berlusconi and romano prodi in contrast to silvio berlusconi , prodi has been rather modest during his campaign appearances in italy .
he has focused on facts and arguments rather than appearances , stressing that he will get italy back on track .
he 's counting on italians ' trust in his capabilities .
he has said the country must overcome its recession and tackle its oppressive budget deficit .
and he has been critical of the current government : " in the past few years , the rich have got richer , the poor , poorer . "
prodi has said promising to develop the country 's economically weak south . romano prodi 's reputation as a serious politician is supported by the numerous academic awards of recognition he has received from around the world and by the many reports on political economics and industrial policy he has published .
even if his style of political leadership and his ability to assert himself are debatable , he has never been involved in scandals which could compromise his credibility and incorruptibility . samera zagala -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped .

steinmeier also condemned the arrest of hundreds of opposition supporters by lukashenko 's regime in minsk .
he emphasized that the eu was weighing whether to impose trade sanctions against belarus - which the russian foreign minister described as inappropriate . " the results of the recent elections in belarus and ukraine reflect the people 's will in these two sovereign states and should be accepted as such , " lavrov said .
" other nations should display respect for the election results and see them as the basis for shaping their own relations with minsk and kiev .
everything is fine as long as the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is observed . " lavrov suggested that any problems that had arisen with regard to belarus should be resolved not by isolating minsk , but through increased dialogue and engagement . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia 's eastward drift when britain , france and germany meet with russia over iran 's nuclear ambitions , they will be dealing with a country that has developed a new , bolder foreign policy .

1 at the nrw / k20 kustsammlung in the german city of düsseldorf , explores the ways in which the museum - a traditionally conservative cultural institution - has been transformed into a striking urban landmark and an exciting playground for architectural experiment . the sinuous stone , glass , and titanium curves of frank o. gerhy 's guggenheim museum in bilbao , for example , or the physical and metaphoric void which cuts across daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin , have shown that museum buildings are increasingly becoming symbols of urban identity . the düsseldorf exhibition showcases 26 impressive and forward-looking museum designs in different stages of architectural production : as models , as constructions sites or as completed buildings . experimental museums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin architects whose work is featured in the exhibition include architectural megastars such as daniel liebeskind , frank o. gehry , renzo piano or the us-austrian studio coop himmelb -lrb- l -rrb- au .
their work is documented through models , computer simulations , sketches and installations . with museums that look like anchored ships and those that are buried in the ground , or the ones that resemble gigantic aluminum tubes , the exhibition illustrates the ways in which museums have become places of experiment with form and meaning in architecture and society at large . the museums of the 21st century have very little in common with the heavy structures of the 19th century , whose goal was to inspire awe and provide a sense of cultural stability .
the museums of the future are much more fluid and playful .
in a true postmodern fashion , their visually striking forms often accentuate a society in transition or crisis of values . urban landmarks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relic from the past : the old national gallery in berlin unlike traditional museums , which were attracting visitors mainly because of the art works which were displayed in them , contemporary museums have become objects of interest on their own . the popularity of contemporary museums has a lot to do with the fact that these spectacular buildings have taken on the prominent architectural role which was once reserved for cathedrals in various european cityscapes .
but also , as armin zweite , director of the düsseldorf exhibition space k20 points out , they have become symbols of progressive thinking . " cities and states have started building new museums not necessarily in order to host grand collections , but rather to set a signal , " said zweite . the düsseldorf exhibition will be open until june 25th . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " melancholy " proves to be a powerful lure an exhibition in berlin tracing melancholy in art has surprisingly become a phenomenal success .

their appearances are likely to be televised . the panel will first meet to decide the order in which witnesses will appear . the two parties which form the current power-sharing government , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , were opposed to holding a full investigation because they believe the internal parliamentary probes answered all the relevant questions . they also fear such an inquiry could endanger the confidentiality of the secret services . opposition parties get their inquiry but the three opposition parties - the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- ; the left party ; and the greens , who were government coalition partners at the time of the iraq war - represent the quarter of seats in the 614-member chamber required to force a full inquiry . the panel consists of four christian democrats , four social democrats and one member of each of the opposition parties .

togo : strong expat fan base czech republic : families in the fan block france : female fans in a frenzy spain : supporting diversity sports -pipe- 07.04.2006 fans of the world unite at an international congress in bonn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan leaders from around the world prepping for the world cup fan participation was the name of the game at the fans for football conference in bonn .
what expectations do fans have for the world cup ?
what events are on the game plan ?
and what fan fears need to be overcome ? soccer teams from thirty-two nations are warming up for the 2006 world cup in germany - and so are their fans .
on april 6 and 7 , fan group representatives from all over the world met in bonn at the international congress fans for football , sponsored by the friedrich ebert foundation , to share and compare how their countries will turn the cup into a festival of cultures . for kevin miles , the slogan of the 2006 world cup - " a time to make friends " - could not be more fitting .
the head of the british football supporters federation said that soccer fans in england already feel like they 've been welcomed to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin miles from the british football supporters federation " i think it is interesting to compare this slogan with the world cup in france eight years ago , " miles said .
" in 2000 , the french and british governments spent over 1.5 million british pounds -lrb- 2.15 million euros -rrb- on the advertising campaign ' no ticket , no travel ' to make sure that only british fans with stadium tickets traveled to france .
germany has invited soccer fans to participate in world cup events , whether they have tickets to a game or not . " stadium feeling on the market square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 7 million expected for public viewing events conference participants agreed that public viewing venues , i.e. big screen televisions with live game coverage set up in market squares , parks and bars throughout germany , are the key to the fans . for thomas schneider , head of the german fan coordination group kos , public viewing is a huge step forward and an enormous challenge .
" we expect over seven million fans to participate in public viewing events in the twelve world cup cities alone , " schneider said .
" so we will have fan embassies where foreign fans can get everything from accommodation information to the occasional band-aid . " fans : security risk or team player ? the idea of millions of rival soccer enthusiasts watching television in downtown munich , cologne or berlin is both exciting and a terrifying .
willy kösling , deputy head of the national security task force in the federal ministry of the interior , said that the police in germany are prepared .
" we are n't worried about the fans as a security risk , " kösling said .
" we need the fans to help deescalate the small groups of those inclined to violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police : keeping an eye on the game and the fans however , conference participants complained that the decentralized german police have fans abroad worried .
regulations and security measures differ from state to state and stadium to stadium , they say .
some of the official fan areas in the cities will have overt police presence , security check-points and a long list of dos and do n'ts attached to them . english fans at the conference said they fear that brits may be singled out as hooligans .
but willy kösling from the ministry of the interior said that police profiling measures for potential hooligans will keep them from entering the country .
and foreign fans , he said , will not notice any difference in police behavior , whether they are in kassel and cologne .
" our policy is to coordinate all of our activities as best possible , " kösling said .
" the most important thing we have been teaching our officers - take everything with a smile . " wanted : housemates , girl gamers , fan forwards one of the focal points of the fans for football congress was to help fan groups bring fans from competing teams together .
one initiative , a roof for fans , has set up a database to connect german fans with their foreign soccer soul-mates .
anyone willing to offer a room , a bed or just space on the floor to crash during the world cup can sign up .
of the 340 accommodations online , more than 40 percent are free of charge , said peter schüngel , head of the initiative . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans want to show their colors , too another program , " kick it " , will bring teenage girls from morocco , egypt , poland and germany to leipzig to make friends and kick up some turf in a soccer camp .
and in kassel , twenty-three international fan soccer teams will be competing against one another for their own fans ' world cup . siegbert heir from the friedrich ebert foundation summed it up .
" the fans are not just on the sidelines at the world cup in germany , " he said .
" everyone thinks that soccer teams have 11 players .
they do n't .
the fans are the 12th player on the team .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .

" belarus opposition leader alexander milinkevich met with german chancellor angela merkel and other political leaders in berlin on friday , urging the eu to forgo sanctions against his country . " we are taking a very cautious stance on any plans to impose economic sanctions against belarus , " he said .
" experience has shown that economic sanctions more often than not hurt the poorest in society and affect the leadership to a far lesser degree .

" " it is time to put this crisis behind us , to restore calm and unity to the country , " he added .
" the immediate priority ... is naturally appeasement . " villepin 's authority has been badly undermined in the battle over the first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- , which president jacques chirac effectively suspended at the weekend , asking for a new law to be drawn up after talks with unions . pm gets slap in the face as sarkozy handles talks responsibility for the negotiations has been handed to villepin 's powerful rival , ruling ump party chief and interior minister nicolas sarkozy , and a recent poll showed 45 percent of the public think the prime minister should step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin has conceded negotiation control to sarkozy villepin urged conciliation to end the two-month crisis after protests drew more than a million people - three million , unions said - into the streets for the second time in eight days on tuesday . he called on unions - holding a second day of talks with the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- - to " recognize that flexibility is necessary in order to provide employment for all . " " let us not aim for a zero-risk society , which would be an immobile one , but rather for a society of managed risk , " villepin said , stressing that fighting unemployment remained his government 's top priority . he announced plans to strengthen the links between business and universities to improve graduate job prospects , as well as improve worker protection and fight poverty and exclusion - seen as responsible for france 's suburban riots last year . a catalogue of failures to listen and to act conceived as a tool against youth unemployment which runs at 22 percent in france , the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . it has provoked a massive backlash from unions and students , with villepin accused of trampling on hard-won labor rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continue as the government frets over its next move more than 3,500 people have been arrested and hundreds of riot police injured in the sometimes violent protests . chirac last week offered a compromise to end the crisis - one of the worst in his 11-year presidency - by ratifying the measure , but promising a new law to amend its most contested provisions . but unions , backed by the main opposition socialist party , have demanded the cpe be abrogated entirely by april 17 , the start of parliament 's spring recess . unions want cpe dumped by parliament 's spring recess the ump has been holding a series of meetings with unions and student groups , the medef employers ' association and the cgpme small business federation , to hammer out an accord , with discussions due to wrap up on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's image - and its property - is taking a battering finance minister thierry breton said he was concerned the protests were harming france 's image abroad , although he said they had so far had no impact on the economy . meanwhile , wildcat student protests continued across the country , with hundreds of demonstrators blocking a key access road to paris ' orly airport , and others invading tracks at two main paris train stations . clashes broke out with police after crowds of several hundred students tried to break onto the capital 's ring-road . disruptions continue as threat of easter action draws near in the southwest city of toulouse , two students were injured when police moved in to clear tracks at the city 's railway station .
demonstrators also blocked access to two factories belonging to the aircraft manufacturer airbus near the city . roadblocks paralyzed traffic on the highway linking lyon with marseille on the mediterranean coast , with similar roadblocks near the western cities of nantes , rennes and lorient , limoges in central france and nancy in the east . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de easter action planned as french protestors set deadline french union and student leaders set an easter deadline wednesday for the government to repeal its youth jobs law or face a repeat of the million-strong protests that have engulfed the nation .
-lrb- april 6 , 2006 -rrb- chirac plans dismissed as france teeters on brink of anarchy trade unions and students were more determined than ever saturday to go ahead with strikes and demonstrations against a new youth jobs law despite a compromise plan by president jacques chirac aimed at defusing tensions .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 07.04.2006 italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is not considered a great communicator italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister . italians affectionately call him " the professor " and appreciate his level-headedness .
his fans are captivated by his knowledge and expertise .
romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .
he was born on aug .
9 , 1939 as the eighth of nine children in scandiano , italy 's " red " emilia-romagna region long administered by communists .
his father was an engineer , his mother , a teacher .
prodi married flavia prodi franzoni , a university teacher , in 1969 .
the couple have two sons .
" i like being in the midst of a lot of people - there are 55 of us altogether in my family . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi on an italian state television talk show after graduation from high school , prodi took a degree in law with distinction in 1961 and then pursued postgraduate studies at the renowned london school of economics .
from 1963-1969 , he was assistant professor , then professor of industrial organization and industrial policy at the university of bologna . getting italy euro-ready prodi entered politics at the end of the 1970s as a non-partisan and was appointed industry minister in giulio andreotti 's government . the economics expert made a name for himself as chairman and reorganizer of the state-run holding company called the institute for industrial reconstruction -lrb- iri -rrb- , preparing the company for privatization . prodi made the leap to political power in 1996 when he founded the ulivo -lrb- olive tree -rrb- center-left coalition .
he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .
the leftist coalition had to withstand several crises , reorganized the government and , in 2001 , lost in parliamentary elections to silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition . unfilled expectations in brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to govern italy romano prodi was faced with a new political challenge in 1999 .
european commission members had collectively resigned in march due to allegations of fraud , mismanagement and nepotism in the eu 's executive body .
prodi took up the post of president of the european commission that year - which he held until 2004 - with high hopes of sweeping reforms . yet the politician who had earned his laurels early on had a hard time fulfilling the high expectations in brussels .
even before he moved to the eu capital , he had been dubbed a " tender power player " in rome .
prodi was not the eloquent , " great communicator " necessary for conveying the idea of europe and mediating between eu member states . calls for resignation in 2002 , prodi reaped europe-wide dissatisfaction and hardly concealed calls for his resignation when he described the european stability and growth pact - the rules that underpin the euro - as " dumb " and demanded a more flexible plan .
as commission president , his remarks compromised his own institution 's credibility and capacity to act .
financial inconsistencies at the european statistics agency eurostat in 2003 also did not reflect well on prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not always popular as european commission president during prodi 's tenure as head of the commission the eu grew to include 10 mainly former communist countries .
the back and forth over the bloc 's first constitution also took off .
though all eu member states signed the draft constitution , its future has been in doubt ever since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it . difficult departure prodi did n't gain much support from the european council for a second term .
he had already been vehemently criticized for his publication europe : the dream and the choices , which many considered to be more of a report on italian domestic policies rather a discussion of european topics .
prodi was accused of abusing his power as head of the commission to pursue his political career in italy .
the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that despite hostilities and predictions that he would leave office prematurely , prodi " displayed a great deal of staying power , " yet also left behind the impression that he was a man who " tended to go it alone and who lacked trust in his instincts . " a return to italian politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forever at odds : silvio berlusconi and romano prodi in contrast to silvio berlusconi , prodi has been rather modest during his campaign appearances in italy .
he has focused on facts and arguments rather than appearances , stressing that he will get italy back on track .
he 's counting on italians ' trust in his capabilities .
he has said the country must overcome its recession and tackle its oppressive budget deficit .
and he has been critical of the current government : " in the past few years , the rich have got richer , the poor , poorer . "
prodi has said promising to develop the country 's economically weak south . romano prodi 's reputation as a serious politician is supported by the numerous academic awards of recognition he has received from around the world and by the many reports on political economics and industrial policy he has published .
even if his style of political leadership and his ability to assert himself are debatable , he has never been involved in scandals which could compromise his credibility and incorruptibility . samera zagala -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped .

romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .
he was born on aug .
9 , 1939 as the eighth of nine children in scandiano , italy 's " red " emilia-romagna region long administered by communists .

he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach .

what expectations do fans have for the world cup ?
what events are on the game plan ?
and what fan fears need to be overcome ? soccer teams from thirty-two nations are warming up for the 2006 world cup in germany - and so are their fans .
on april 6 and 7 , fan group representatives from all over the world met in bonn at the international congress fans for football , sponsored by the friedrich ebert foundation , to share and compare how their countries will turn the cup into a festival of cultures . for kevin miles , the slogan of the 2006 world cup - " a time to make friends " - could not be more fitting .
the head of the british football supporters federation said that soccer fans in england already feel like they 've been welcomed to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin miles from the british football supporters federation " i think it is interesting to compare this slogan with the world cup in france eight years ago , " miles said .
" in 2000 , the french and british governments spent over 1.5 million british pounds -lrb- 2.15 million euros -rrb- on the advertising campaign ' no ticket , no travel ' to make sure that only british fans with stadium tickets traveled to france .
germany has invited soccer fans to participate in world cup events , whether they have tickets to a game or not . " stadium feeling on the market square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 7 million expected for public viewing events conference participants agreed that public viewing venues , i.e. big screen televisions with live game coverage set up in market squares , parks and bars throughout germany , are the key to the fans . for thomas schneider , head of the german fan coordination group kos , public viewing is a huge step forward and an enormous challenge .
" we expect over seven million fans to participate in public viewing events in the twelve world cup cities alone , " schneider said .
" so we will have fan embassies where foreign fans can get everything from accommodation information to the occasional band-aid . " fans : security risk or team player ? the idea of millions of rival soccer enthusiasts watching television in downtown munich , cologne or berlin is both exciting and a terrifying .
willy kösling , deputy head of the national security task force in the federal ministry of the interior , said that the police in germany are prepared .
" we are n't worried about the fans as a security risk , " kösling said .
" we need the fans to help deescalate the small groups of those inclined to violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police : keeping an eye on the game and the fans however , conference participants complained that the decentralized german police have fans abroad worried .
regulations and security measures differ from state to state and stadium to stadium , they say .
some of the official fan areas in the cities will have overt police presence , security check-points and a long list of dos and do n'ts attached to them . english fans at the conference said they fear that brits may be singled out as hooligans .
but willy kösling from the ministry of the interior said that police profiling measures for potential hooligans will keep them from entering the country .
and foreign fans , he said , will not notice any difference in police behavior , whether they are in kassel and cologne .
" our policy is to coordinate all of our activities as best possible , " kösling said .
" the most important thing we have been teaching our officers - take everything with a smile . " wanted : housemates , girl gamers , fan forwards one of the focal points of the fans for football congress was to help fan groups bring fans from competing teams together .
one initiative , a roof for fans , has set up a database to connect german fans with their foreign soccer soul-mates .
anyone willing to offer a room , a bed or just space on the floor to crash during the world cup can sign up .
of the 340 accommodations online , more than 40 percent are free of charge , said peter schüngel , head of the initiative . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans want to show their colors , too another program , " kick it " , will bring teenage girls from morocco , egypt , poland and germany to leipzig to make friends and kick up some turf in a soccer camp .
and in kassel , twenty-three international fan soccer teams will be competing against one another for their own fans ' world cup . siegbert heir from the friedrich ebert foundation summed it up .
" the fans are not just on the sidelines at the world cup in germany , " he said .
" everyone thinks that soccer teams have 11 players .
they do n't .
the fans are the 12th player on the team .
and without them , the games would n't be the same . " kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches world cup charm offensive germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 07.04.2006 italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is not considered a great communicator italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister . italians affectionately call him " the professor " and appreciate his level-headedness .
his fans are captivated by his knowledge and expertise .
romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .
he was born on aug .
9 , 1939 as the eighth of nine children in scandiano , italy 's " red " emilia-romagna region long administered by communists .
his father was an engineer , his mother , a teacher .
prodi married flavia prodi franzoni , a university teacher , in 1969 .
the couple have two sons .
" i like being in the midst of a lot of people - there are 55 of us altogether in my family . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi on an italian state television talk show after graduation from high school , prodi took a degree in law with distinction in 1961 and then pursued postgraduate studies at the renowned london school of economics .
from 1963-1969 , he was assistant professor , then professor of industrial organization and industrial policy at the university of bologna . getting italy euro-ready prodi entered politics at the end of the 1970s as a non-partisan and was appointed industry minister in giulio andreotti 's government . the economics expert made a name for himself as chairman and reorganizer of the state-run holding company called the institute for industrial reconstruction -lrb- iri -rrb- , preparing the company for privatization . prodi made the leap to political power in 1996 when he founded the ulivo -lrb- olive tree -rrb- center-left coalition .
he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .

even before he moved to the eu capital , he had been dubbed a " tender power player " in rome .
prodi was not the eloquent , " great communicator " necessary for conveying the idea of europe and mediating between eu member states . calls for resignation in 2002 , prodi reaped europe-wide dissatisfaction and hardly concealed calls for his resignation when he described the european stability and growth pact - the rules that underpin the euro - as " dumb " and demanded a more flexible plan .
as commission president , his remarks compromised his own institution 's credibility and capacity to act .
financial inconsistencies at the european statistics agency eurostat in 2003 also did not reflect well on prodi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not always popular as european commission president during prodi 's tenure as head of the commission the eu grew to include 10 mainly former communist countries .
the back and forth over the bloc 's first constitution also took off .
though all eu member states signed the draft constitution , its future has been in doubt ever since voters in france and the netherlands rejected it . difficult departure prodi did n't gain much support from the european council for a second term .
he had already been vehemently criticized for his publication europe : the dream and the choices , which many considered to be more of a report on italian domestic policies rather a discussion of european topics .
prodi was accused of abusing his power as head of the commission to pursue his political career in italy .
the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that despite hostilities and predictions that he would leave office prematurely , prodi " displayed a great deal of staying power , " yet also left behind the impression that he was a man who " tended to go it alone and who lacked trust in his instincts . " a return to italian politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forever at odds : silvio berlusconi and romano prodi in contrast to silvio berlusconi , prodi has been rather modest during his campaign appearances in italy .
he has focused on facts and arguments rather than appearances , stressing that he will get italy back on track .
he 's counting on italians ' trust in his capabilities .

" our joint salis transport project for instance gives us the opportunity to provide air-borne humanitarian support for earthquake victims in pakistan .

he emphasized that the eu was weighing whether to impose trade sanctions against belarus - which the russian foreign minister described as inappropriate . " the results of the recent elections in belarus and ukraine reflect the people 's will in these two sovereign states and should be accepted as such , " lavrov said .
" other nations should display respect for the election results and see them as the basis for shaping their own relations with minsk and kiev .
everything is fine as long as the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is observed .

" our joint salis transport project for instance gives us the opportunity to provide air-borne humanitarian support for earthquake victims in pakistan .

he emphasized that the eu was weighing whether to impose trade sanctions against belarus - which the russian foreign minister described as inappropriate . " the results of the recent elections in belarus and ukraine reflect the people 's will in these two sovereign states and should be accepted as such , " lavrov said .
" other nations should display respect for the election results and see them as the basis for shaping their own relations with minsk and kiev .
everything is fine as long as the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is observed .

1 at the nrw / k20 kustsammlung in the german city of düsseldorf , explores the ways in which the museum - a traditionally conservative cultural institution - has been transformed into a striking urban landmark and an exciting playground for architectural experiment . the sinuous stone , glass , and titanium curves of frank o. gerhy 's guggenheim museum in bilbao , for example , or the physical and metaphoric void which cuts across daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin , have shown that museum buildings are increasingly becoming symbols of urban identity . the düsseldorf exhibition showcases 26 impressive and forward-looking museum designs in different stages of architectural production : as models , as constructions sites or as completed buildings . experimental museums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin architects whose work is featured in the exhibition include architectural megastars such as daniel liebeskind , frank o. gehry , renzo piano or the us-austrian studio coop himmelb -lrb- l -rrb- au .
their work is documented through models , computer simulations , sketches and installations . with museums that look like anchored ships and those that are buried in the ground , or the ones that resemble gigantic aluminum tubes , the exhibition illustrates the ways in which museums have become places of experiment with form and meaning in architecture and society at large . the museums of the 21st century have very little in common with the heavy structures of the 19th century , whose goal was to inspire awe and provide a sense of cultural stability .
the museums of the future are much more fluid and playful .
in a true postmodern fashion , their visually striking forms often accentuate a society in transition or crisis of values . urban landmarks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relic from the past : the old national gallery in berlin unlike traditional museums , which were attracting visitors mainly because of the art works which were displayed in them , contemporary museums have become objects of interest on their own . the popularity of contemporary museums has a lot to do with the fact that these spectacular buildings have taken on the prominent architectural role which was once reserved for cathedrals in various european cityscapes .
but also , as armin zweite , director of the düsseldorf exhibition space k20 points out , they have become symbols of progressive thinking . " cities and states have started building new museums not necessarily in order to host grand collections , but rather to set a signal , " said zweite . the düsseldorf exhibition will be open until june 25th . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " melancholy " proves to be a powerful lure an exhibition in berlin tracing melancholy in art has surprisingly become a phenomenal success .

" belarus opposition leader alexander milinkevich met with german chancellor angela merkel and other political leaders in berlin on friday , urging the eu to forgo sanctions against his country . " we are taking a very cautious stance on any plans to impose economic sanctions against belarus , " he said .
" experience has shown that economic sanctions more often than not hurt the poorest in society and affect the leadership to a far lesser degree . " ending a week-long tour of the eu , milinkevich said he was grateful for the overwhelming support he had received over the past few days from the european parliament and commission as well as from individual eu member states .
but he warned that if sanctions are imposed , the regime in minsk might effectively be able to portray itself as a martyr . " we would n't like to provide a dictator with such an opportunity , " he said .
" this is why we are in favor of limited sanctions which target only those who violate democratic laws by discriminating against whole groups of the population and subjecting them to reprisals . " travel restrictions likely germany 's christian democratic union secretary general ronald pofalla said he understood the opposition 's concerns , adding that travel restrictions for lukashenko and his ministers are a far more likely eu measure than economic sanctions .
pofalla also came out in favor of easier and less bureaucratic exchange of scientists and ngo representatives from both countries .

" we have also reiterated our demand to immediately release all those who were arrested by lukashenko 's regime during the peaceful protests before and after the parliamentary elections . " lukashenko 's inauguration saturday would not be accompanied by yet another round of protests in minsk because " we do n't want to see more people jailed , " milinkevich said .
" we 'll rather have to fight for the speedy release of those already in lukashenko 's prisons . " follows russian visit the opposition leader 's stop followed a two-day visit by russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , who held talks with german defense minister franz joseph jung .
the two ministers disagreed over belarus with russia expressing support for the current regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' regime is dependent on cheap russian oil on this trip , milinkevich was hesitant to openly criticize russia for its unambiguous support for lukashenko .
but he hoped that president vladimir putin would change his mind as protests against the regime in minsk were continuing unabated throughout europe . " basing the opposition 's strategy on an equation which does n't include russia just would n't work , " he says .
" it 's important to realize that without moscow 's support , the current belarusian regime would n't be able to survive for long .
besides , our coalition of opposition forces is by no means anti-russian .
we endorse good relations with our big neighbor . " meanwhile , the belarusian foreign ministry has poked fun at milinkevich 's tour of europe , saying that his post-election campaign against lukashenko is a joke .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence .

" after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .

kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .

1 at the nrw / k20 kustsammlung in the german city of düsseldorf , explores the ways in which the museum - a traditionally conservative cultural institution - has been transformed into a striking urban landmark and an exciting playground for architectural experiment . the sinuous stone , glass , and titanium curves of frank o. gerhy 's guggenheim museum in bilbao , for example , or the physical and metaphoric void which cuts across daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin , have shown that museum buildings are increasingly becoming symbols of urban identity . the düsseldorf exhibition showcases 26 impressive and forward-looking museum designs in different stages of architectural production : as models , as constructions sites or as completed buildings . experimental museums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin architects whose work is featured in the exhibition include architectural megastars such as daniel liebeskind , frank o. gehry , renzo piano or the us-austrian studio coop himmelb -lrb- l -rrb- au .
their work is documented through models , computer simulations , sketches and installations . with museums that look like anchored ships and those that are buried in the ground , or the ones that resemble gigantic aluminum tubes , the exhibition illustrates the ways in which museums have become places of experiment with form and meaning in architecture and society at large . the museums of the 21st century have very little in common with the heavy structures of the 19th century , whose goal was to inspire awe and provide a sense of cultural stability .
the museums of the future are much more fluid and playful .
in a true postmodern fashion , their visually striking forms often accentuate a society in transition or crisis of values . urban landmarks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relic from the past : the old national gallery in berlin unlike traditional museums , which were attracting visitors mainly because of the art works which were displayed in them , contemporary museums have become objects of interest on their own . the popularity of contemporary museums has a lot to do with the fact that these spectacular buildings have taken on the prominent architectural role which was once reserved for cathedrals in various european cityscapes .
but also , as armin zweite , director of the düsseldorf exhibition space k20 points out , they have become symbols of progressive thinking . " cities and states have started building new museums not necessarily in order to host grand collections , but rather to set a signal , " said zweite . the düsseldorf exhibition will be open until june 25th . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " melancholy " proves to be a powerful lure an exhibition in berlin tracing melancholy in art has surprisingly become a phenomenal success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 07.04.2006 jens lehmann named german number one for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's - and now germany 's - number one : jens lehmann germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .
german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .
they need n't have worried - – neither goalkeeper has spoken to the other for almost two years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi : warring keepers to be separated german national coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to keep goalkeeping rivals oliver kahn and jens lehmann apart for the next six warm-up matches to prevent further friction building up ahead of the 2006 world cup .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .

" while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .

" belarus opposition leader alexander milinkevich met with german chancellor angela merkel and other political leaders in berlin on friday , urging the eu to forgo sanctions against his country . " we are taking a very cautious stance on any plans to impose economic sanctions against belarus , " he said .
" experience has shown that economic sanctions more often than not hurt the poorest in society and affect the leadership to a far lesser degree . " ending a week-long tour of the eu , milinkevich said he was grateful for the overwhelming support he had received over the past few days from the european parliament and commission as well as from individual eu member states .
but he warned that if sanctions are imposed , the regime in minsk might effectively be able to portray itself as a martyr . " we would n't like to provide a dictator with such an opportunity , " he said .
" this is why we are in favor of limited sanctions which target only those who violate democratic laws by discriminating against whole groups of the population and subjecting them to reprisals . " travel restrictions likely germany 's christian democratic union secretary general ronald pofalla said he understood the opposition 's concerns , adding that travel restrictions for lukashenko and his ministers are a far more likely eu measure than economic sanctions .
pofalla also came out in favor of easier and less bureaucratic exchange of scientists and ngo representatives from both countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander milinkevich " people in belarus can rest assured that germany will support democratically-minded forces in their country and stand up for human rights there , " he said .
" we have also reiterated our demand to immediately release all those who were arrested by lukashenko 's regime during the peaceful protests before and after the parliamentary elections . " lukashenko 's inauguration saturday would not be accompanied by yet another round of protests in minsk because " we do n't want to see more people jailed , " milinkevich said .
" we 'll rather have to fight for the speedy release of those already in lukashenko 's prisons . " follows russian visit the opposition leader 's stop followed a two-day visit by russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , who held talks with german defense minister franz joseph jung .
the two ministers disagreed over belarus with russia expressing support for the current regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' regime is dependent on cheap russian oil on this trip , milinkevich was hesitant to openly criticize russia for its unambiguous support for lukashenko .
but he hoped that president vladimir putin would change his mind as protests against the regime in minsk were continuing unabated throughout europe . " basing the opposition 's strategy on an equation which does n't include russia just would n't work , " he says .
" it 's important to realize that without moscow 's support , the current belarusian regime would n't be able to survive for long .
besides , our coalition of opposition forces is by no means anti-russian .
we endorse good relations with our big neighbor .

1 at the nrw / k20 kustsammlung in the german city of düsseldorf , explores the ways in which the museum - a traditionally conservative cultural institution - has been transformed into a striking urban landmark and an exciting playground for architectural experiment . the sinuous stone , glass , and titanium curves of frank o. gerhy 's guggenheim museum in bilbao , for example , or the physical and metaphoric void which cuts across daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin , have shown that museum buildings are increasingly becoming symbols of urban identity . the düsseldorf exhibition showcases 26 impressive and forward-looking museum designs in different stages of architectural production : as models , as constructions sites or as completed buildings . experimental museums bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel liebeskind 's jewish museum in berlin architects whose work is featured in the exhibition include architectural megastars such as daniel liebeskind , frank o. gehry , renzo piano or the us-austrian studio coop himmelb -lrb- l -rrb- au .
their work is documented through models , computer simulations , sketches and installations . with museums that look like anchored ships and those that are buried in the ground , or the ones that resemble gigantic aluminum tubes , the exhibition illustrates the ways in which museums have become places of experiment with form and meaning in architecture and society at large . the museums of the 21st century have very little in common with the heavy structures of the 19th century , whose goal was to inspire awe and provide a sense of cultural stability .
the museums of the future are much more fluid and playful .
in a true postmodern fashion , their visually striking forms often accentuate a society in transition or crisis of values . urban landmarks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relic from the past : the old national gallery in berlin unlike traditional museums , which were attracting visitors mainly because of the art works which were displayed in them , contemporary museums have become objects of interest on their own . the popularity of contemporary museums has a lot to do with the fact that these spectacular buildings have taken on the prominent architectural role which was once reserved for cathedrals in various european cityscapes .
but also , as armin zweite , director of the düsseldorf exhibition space k20 points out , they have become symbols of progressive thinking . " cities and states have started building new museums not necessarily in order to host grand collections , but rather to set a signal , " said zweite . the düsseldorf exhibition will be open until june 25th . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " melancholy " proves to be a powerful lure an exhibition in berlin tracing melancholy in art has surprisingly become a phenomenal success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.04.2006 belarus opposition leader urges pressure , not sanctions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition says eu support not sanctions will help one day before alexander lukashenko 's third inauguration as president of belarus , opposition leader alexander milinkevich once again urged the west to step up the pressure on " the last dictatorship in europe . " belarus opposition leader alexander milinkevich met with german chancellor angela merkel and other political leaders in berlin on friday , urging the eu to forgo sanctions against his country . " we are taking a very cautious stance on any plans to impose economic sanctions against belarus , " he said .
" experience has shown that economic sanctions more often than not hurt the poorest in society and affect the leadership to a far lesser degree . " ending a week-long tour of the eu , milinkevich said he was grateful for the overwhelming support he had received over the past few days from the european parliament and commission as well as from individual eu member states .
but he warned that if sanctions are imposed , the regime in minsk might effectively be able to portray itself as a martyr . " we would n't like to provide a dictator with such an opportunity , " he said .
" this is why we are in favor of limited sanctions which target only those who violate democratic laws by discriminating against whole groups of the population and subjecting them to reprisals . " travel restrictions likely germany 's christian democratic union secretary general ronald pofalla said he understood the opposition 's concerns , adding that travel restrictions for lukashenko and his ministers are a far more likely eu measure than economic sanctions .
pofalla also came out in favor of easier and less bureaucratic exchange of scientists and ngo representatives from both countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander milinkevich " people in belarus can rest assured that germany will support democratically-minded forces in their country and stand up for human rights there , " he said .
" we have also reiterated our demand to immediately release all those who were arrested by lukashenko 's regime during the peaceful protests before and after the parliamentary elections . " lukashenko 's inauguration saturday would not be accompanied by yet another round of protests in minsk because " we do n't want to see more people jailed , " milinkevich said .
" we 'll rather have to fight for the speedy release of those already in lukashenko 's prisons . " follows russian visit the opposition leader 's stop followed a two-day visit by russian foreign minister sergey lavrov , who held talks with german defense minister franz joseph jung .
the two ministers disagreed over belarus with russia expressing support for the current regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' regime is dependent on cheap russian oil on this trip , milinkevich was hesitant to openly criticize russia for its unambiguous support for lukashenko .
but he hoped that president vladimir putin would change his mind as protests against the regime in minsk were continuing unabated throughout europe . " basing the opposition 's strategy on an equation which does n't include russia just would n't work , " he says .
" it 's important to realize that without moscow 's support , the current belarusian regime would n't be able to survive for long .
besides , our coalition of opposition forces is by no means anti-russian .
we endorse good relations with our big neighbor . " meanwhile , the belarusian foreign ministry has poked fun at milinkevich 's tour of europe , saying that his post-election campaign against lukashenko is a joke . " it 's time that the opposition woke up to the realities in belarus , " a spokesman said . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian foreign minister ends his visit to berlin at the end of his two-day visit to berlin , russia 's foreign minister met with germany 's defense minister to discuss a range of sensitive issues , including iran 's nuclear ambitions , nato expansion and belarus elections .

his fans are captivated by his knowledge and expertise .
romano prodi knows how to keep up good relations with people .
that quality has proven to an important strength in the campaign set to end when voters cast their ballots in italy 's april 9-10 general election .
despite his academic standing , he does n't come across as being conceited or snobbish .
he traveled by bus , for instance , throughout his campaign tour in 1996 .
the 66-year-old is considered to be center-left in his politics and appeals to people to refocus on the values laid down by the italian constitution , such as religious freedom and respect for the common good . the family man romano prodi 's large family has influenced him the most .

he was the first politician in postwar italy to build a government with politicians from the left . as prime minister from 1996 to 1998 , he secured italy 's place in the first wave of countries to adopt the euro by pushing through a drastic savings program .
in 1998 , the communists led by fausto bertinotti failed to support prime minister prodi and brought down his government after he had been in office just two and a half years .

" belarus opposition leader alexander milinkevich met with german chancellor angela merkel and other political leaders in berlin on friday , urging the eu to forgo sanctions against his country . " we are taking a very cautious stance on any plans to impose economic sanctions against belarus , " he said .
" experience has shown that economic sanctions more often than not hurt the poorest in society and affect the leadership to a far lesser degree . " ending a week-long tour of the eu , milinkevich said he was grateful for the overwhelming support he had received over the past few days from the european parliament and commission as well as from individual eu member states .
but he warned that if sanctions are imposed , the regime in minsk might effectively be able to portray itself as a martyr . " we would n't like to provide a dictator with such an opportunity , " he said .
" this is why we are in favor of limited sanctions which target only those who violate democratic laws by discriminating against whole groups of the population and subjecting them to reprisals . " travel restrictions likely germany 's christian democratic union secretary general ronald pofalla said he understood the opposition 's concerns , adding that travel restrictions for lukashenko and his ministers are a far more likely eu measure than economic sanctions .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .

what events are on the game plan ?
and what fan fears need to be overcome ? soccer teams from thirty-two nations are warming up for the 2006 world cup in germany - and so are their fans .
on april 6 and 7 , fan group representatives from all over the world met in bonn at the international congress fans for football , sponsored by the friedrich ebert foundation , to share and compare how their countries will turn the cup into a festival of cultures . for kevin miles , the slogan of the 2006 world cup - " a time to make friends " - could not be more fitting .
the head of the british football supporters federation said that soccer fans in england already feel like they 've been welcomed to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin miles from the british football supporters federation " i think it is interesting to compare this slogan with the world cup in france eight years ago , " miles said .
" in 2000 , the french and british governments spent over 1.5 million british pounds -lrb- 2.15 million euros -rrb- on the advertising campaign ' no ticket , no travel ' to make sure that only british fans with stadium tickets traveled to france .
germany has invited soccer fans to participate in world cup events , whether they have tickets to a game or not .

" we expect over seven million fans to participate in public viewing events in the twelve world cup cities alone , " schneider said .
" so we will have fan embassies where foreign fans can get everything from accommodation information to the occasional band-aid . " fans : security risk or team player ? the idea of millions of rival soccer enthusiasts watching television in downtown munich , cologne or berlin is both exciting and a terrifying .
willy kösling , deputy head of the national security task force in the federal ministry of the interior , said that the police in germany are prepared .
" we are n't worried about the fans as a security risk , " kösling said .
" we need the fans to help deescalate the small groups of those inclined to violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police : keeping an eye on the game and the fans however , conference participants complained that the decentralized german police have fans abroad worried .
regulations and security measures differ from state to state and stadium to stadium , they say .
some of the official fan areas in the cities will have overt police presence , security check-points and a long list of dos and do n'ts attached to them . english fans at the conference said they fear that brits may be singled out as hooligans .
but willy kösling from the ministry of the interior said that police profiling measures for potential hooligans will keep them from entering the country .
and foreign fans , he said , will not notice any difference in police behavior , whether they are in kassel and cologne .
" our policy is to coordinate all of our activities as best possible , " kösling said .
" the most important thing we have been teaching our officers - take everything with a smile . " wanted : housemates , girl gamers , fan forwards one of the focal points of the fans for football congress was to help fan groups bring fans from competing teams together .
one initiative , a roof for fans , has set up a database to connect german fans with their foreign soccer soul-mates .
anyone willing to offer a room , a bed or just space on the floor to crash during the world cup can sign up .
of the 340 accommodations online , more than 40 percent are free of charge , said peter schüngel , head of the initiative . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans want to show their colors , too another program , " kick it " , will bring teenage girls from morocco , egypt , poland and germany to leipzig to make friends and kick up some turf in a soccer camp .
and in kassel , twenty-three international fan soccer teams will be competing against one another for their own fans ' world cup . siegbert heir from the friedrich ebert foundation summed it up .
" the fans are not just on the sidelines at the world cup in germany , " he said .
" everyone thinks that soccer teams have 11 players .
they do n't .
the fans are the 12th player on the team .

what expectations do fans have for the world cup ?
what events are on the game plan ?
and what fan fears need to be overcome ? soccer teams from thirty-two nations are warming up for the 2006 world cup in germany - and so are their fans .
on april 6 and 7 , fan group representatives from all over the world met in bonn at the international congress fans for football , sponsored by the friedrich ebert foundation , to share and compare how their countries will turn the cup into a festival of cultures . for kevin miles , the slogan of the 2006 world cup - " a time to make friends " - could not be more fitting .
the head of the british football supporters federation said that soccer fans in england already feel like they 've been welcomed to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin miles from the british football supporters federation " i think it is interesting to compare this slogan with the world cup in france eight years ago , " miles said .
" in 2000 , the french and british governments spent over 1.5 million british pounds -lrb- 2.15 million euros -rrb- on the advertising campaign ' no ticket , no travel ' to make sure that only british fans with stadium tickets traveled to france .
germany has invited soccer fans to participate in world cup events , whether they have tickets to a game or not . " stadium feeling on the market square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 7 million expected for public viewing events conference participants agreed that public viewing venues , i.e. big screen televisions with live game coverage set up in market squares , parks and bars throughout germany , are the key to the fans . for thomas schneider , head of the german fan coordination group kos , public viewing is a huge step forward and an enormous challenge .
" we expect over seven million fans to participate in public viewing events in the twelve world cup cities alone , " schneider said .
" so we will have fan embassies where foreign fans can get everything from accommodation information to the occasional band-aid . " fans : security risk or team player ? the idea of millions of rival soccer enthusiasts watching television in downtown munich , cologne or berlin is both exciting and a terrifying .
willy kösling , deputy head of the national security task force in the federal ministry of the interior , said that the police in germany are prepared .
" we are n't worried about the fans as a security risk , " kösling said .
" we need the fans to help deescalate the small groups of those inclined to violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police : keeping an eye on the game and the fans however , conference participants complained that the decentralized german police have fans abroad worried .
regulations and security measures differ from state to state and stadium to stadium , they say .
some of the official fan areas in the cities will have overt police presence , security check-points and a long list of dos and do n'ts attached to them . english fans at the conference said they fear that brits may be singled out as hooligans .
but willy kösling from the ministry of the interior said that police profiling measures for potential hooligans will keep them from entering the country .
and foreign fans , he said , will not notice any difference in police behavior , whether they are in kassel and cologne .
" our policy is to coordinate all of our activities as best possible , " kösling said .
" the most important thing we have been teaching our officers - take everything with a smile . " wanted : housemates , girl gamers , fan forwards one of the focal points of the fans for football congress was to help fan groups bring fans from competing teams together .
one initiative , a roof for fans , has set up a database to connect german fans with their foreign soccer soul-mates .
anyone willing to offer a room , a bed or just space on the floor to crash during the world cup can sign up .
of the 340 accommodations online , more than 40 percent are free of charge , said peter schüngel , head of the initiative . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans want to show their colors , too another program , " kick it " , will bring teenage girls from morocco , egypt , poland and germany to leipzig to make friends and kick up some turf in a soccer camp .
and in kassel , twenty-three international fan soccer teams will be competing against one another for their own fans ' world cup . siegbert heir from the friedrich ebert foundation summed it up .
" the fans are not just on the sidelines at the world cup in germany , " he said .
" everyone thinks that soccer teams have 11 players .
they do n't .
the fans are the 12th player on the team .
and without them , the games would n't be the same . " kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany launches world cup charm offensive germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .

their appearances are likely to be televised . the panel will first meet to decide the order in which witnesses will appear . the two parties which form the current power-sharing government , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats , were opposed to holding a full investigation because they believe the internal parliamentary probes answered all the relevant questions . they also fear such an inquiry could endanger the confidentiality of the secret services . opposition parties get their inquiry but the three opposition parties - the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- ; the left party ; and the greens , who were government coalition partners at the time of the iraq war - represent the quarter of seats in the 614-member chamber required to force a full inquiry . the panel consists of four christian democrats , four social democrats and one member of each of the opposition parties .

german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy . it 's been a barely concealed matter of personal animosity and professional pride ever since german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took over team selection in 2004 .
who would be germany 's number one for the 2006 world cup ? the nation 's two larger-than-life goalkeepers - bayern munich 's oliver kahn and jens lehmann of arsenal - have spent the last 18 months puffing out their chests , trading insults and playing for the starting place between the posts .
but on friday , it was finally revealed that klinsmann had decided to relegate kahn to the substitutes ' bench and install lehmann as the main shot stopper for the world cup . " that was the toughest decision of my short career , " said klinsmann who admitted he felt lehmann was a " tiny bit better " than kahn .
" almost a year ago , in august , oliver was in front but jens has played very well these last few months , since the start of the season , and now he is ahead of oliver .
we think he is a tiny bit better , " added klinsmann . " we have confidence in him , we are convinced he will know how to organise our relatively young defence . " klinsmann had originally claimed a decision would be taken in may but bayern munich forced his hand early amid constant press and public speculation . " this was always going to be a close race .
bayern asked us to take a decision to put an end to this situation which was weighing heavily on them , " added the national team coach . " after the match against the united states -lrb- which germany won 4-1 on march 22 with kahn in goal -rrb- we seriously analysed the evolution of the situation over the last 22 months and we took our decision . " klinsmann added : " oliver was very disappointed , it was not good news for him .
but he reacted in a very professional manner .
jens was very happy that we showed faith in him and vowed to prove his worth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn may find it hard to supress his disappointment kahn 's club , bayern munich , and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- both issued statements after klinsmann had spoken privately with germany 's goalkeeping hero of the last world cup .
kahn , who is on course for yet another league title in germany , was unsurprisingly upset considering that he has barely put a foot wrong this season .
but playing in a team that is rarely troubled at domestic level may have been a disadvantage when it came to staking his claim .
" i am very surprised and hugely disappointed by this decision , " kahn said .
" i will reflect on my international future over the next few weeks . " while kahn has been protected by one of the stingiest defenses in the bundesliga , lehmann has been forced into performing heroics week in , week out for arsenal , as the london club goes through a transitional season with a new team filled with young stars . recognition for lehmann 's great season as defensive rock a shaky start to the season behind an inexperienced back four has brought out the best in lehmann and this has been widely regarded as his best campaign in england .
his towering performances in the champions league have helped arsenal reach the semi-finals for the first time in eight attempts , thwarting the attacking prowess of real madrid and juventus in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's erratic form seems to be behind him two years ago , klinsmann 's choice of lehmann would have been viewed from under raised eyebrows .
the aggressive and unpredictable lehmann had been demoted to reserve keeper at arsenal after making a series of high-profile bloopers , namely in the champions league quarter-final in 2004 against london rivals chelsea , which cost his team the match and the tie . but a man-of-the-match performance in the 2005 fa cup final , in which arsenal beat manchester united on penalties , saw lehmann back in coach arsene wenger 's good books . germany 's international stalwart returned to the role of deputy kahn has been the number one goalkeeper since andreas köpke retired after the 1998 world cup in france , notching up a total of 84 caps for his country . after deputizing in three major international tournaments before getting his chance , kahn has gone on to represent germany at the 2000 and 2004 european championships as well as the 2002 world cup in japan / korea where he won the golden ball for best player and the yashin award for top goalkeeper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli 's days as number one may be over for good it now looks as though his run has come to an end and he will return to the status of deputy for what could be his last world cup . there is unlikely to be any congratulatory phone calls or words of commiseration flowing between munich and london following klinsmann 's decision .
it has been widely reported that the two teutonic titans have few good things to say about each other .
the sniping has not only been about their professional approach but also personal attacks including comments about their differing lifestyles and choice of partners . the animosity reached such a level at one point that high-ranking officials in the german game , including franz beckenbauer , had to intervene to stop the row spreading from the pages of the tabloid press onto the training pitch .
they need n't have worried - – neither goalkeeper has spoken to the other for almost two years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : klinsi : warring keepers to be separated german national coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to keep goalkeeping rivals oliver kahn and jens lehmann apart for the next six warm-up matches to prevent further friction building up ahead of the 2006 world cup .

but for self-confessed clock-watcher ian wentworth this was a dream come true - looking after the great westminster clock and big ben , which is about to celebrate its 150th anniversary .
the clock engineer at westminster palace is one of three people with the huge responsibility of ensuring the accuracy of the historic timepiece .
but the enormity of his role is rarely acknowledged .
mr wentworth said : " no-one believes me when i tell them what i do . "
the task is extremely demanding as his predecessor brian tipper will testify , spending 25 consecutive new year 's eves up the clock tower .
spiral staircase and his unfaltering dedication was rewarded when the 65-year-old , from penge in south-east london , collected an mbe from the queen earlier this year .
stepping into his well-worn shoes , mr wentworth said it was an honour to take up the mantle .

nearly three years after saddam hussein 's government lost control of baghdad , life for many iraqis is still unstable .
the bbc news website asked a panel of six iraqis from around the country to answer questions sent in by readers throughout the day .
click here to see what the panellists said on the day .
click on the links below to read more about the panellists .
samir ali layla al-khafaji sa 'ad al-izzi zeynab mateen dooski essam hamoudi samir ali , 31 , doctor , baghdad samir ali says life under saddam 's regime was at least safe samir left his home town of kirkuk in northern iraq 13 years ago to study medicine in baghdad .
a kidney surgeon in one of baghdad 's busiest hospitals , security is his biggest concern .
he says that many doctors are leaving iraq because life is so dangerous .
" iraq has been handed to people who can not govern .
the us forces have made thousands of mistakes and we are the ones who pay .
they are very unpopular . "
samir used to be able to make the long journey north to visit his family once a week .
as violence has escalated , he can only visit them once a month at best .
" i miss them so much , " he adds .
samir notes that iraq 's new constitution places great emphasis on freedom .
but , for him , freedom of expression means little without the safety that guarantees life .
although he is a sunni , he prefers to be identified as a muslim .
he is cynical about the new breed of politicians vying for power in iraq .
" at least under saddam hussein we had a good life in some respects .
despite its defects there was a police force , a real army , " he says .
" these days , you only have yourself for protection . "
return to the top and send your questions layla al-khafaji , 40s , political worker , baghdad layla al-khafaji returned to baghdad last year after living in exile in canada for 14 years .
after finishing college in the 1980s , she was targeted to join the ba 'ath party .
as a shia , her refusal led to her being imprisoned for 10 years before she fled the country .
after living in a free country for so long i miss the simple pleasures of freedom layla al-khafaji she now works for the united iraqi alliance , the electoral coalition that got the most votes in the 2005 election .
layla believes the key to building democracy in iraq is making the political process transparent to the public .
" there are people from saddam 's government who are trying to reinvent themselves to get back into government - but nobody trusts these people . "
outside work , socialising is difficult for someone with her profile and she spends most of her time with her family at home .
" because i have been on the tv a few times , i can not go out .
even if i want to buy a pair of shoes , i have to send someone out to get them for me . "
" after living in a free country for so long i miss the simple pleasures of freedom , " she says .
" like being able to walk , or to breathe fresh air . "
return to the top and send your questions sa 'ad al-izzi , 32 , journalist , baghdad sa 'ad al-izzi says violence has made life worse for many after the us-led invasion , sa 'ad al-izzi became a journalist because he wanted to tell the world the real story about iraq .
" unlike foreign correspondents i can walk around freely and so i report the tales of friends , relatives and ordinary people in the street , " he says .
a secular sunni , sa 'ad grew up in a military neighbourhood of baghdad .
he says that life for everybody revolved around war .
when the iran-iraq war finally ended in 1988 , " we thought it was going to be heaven . "
but his family 's optimism vanished with the invasion of kuwait three years later and the ensuing hardship of international embargoes and sanctions .
hopes ran high once again after saddam hussein fell from power , he adds .
but sa 'ad believes that violence and lawlessness during the occupation have made life far worse for many .
he lives with his mother and sister and worries constantly about their safety .
his sister has witnessed gun fights in the streets and narrowly escaped a car bomb explosion .
curfew confines him to his home in the evenings .
" after sunset , i go a little crazy as i ca n't go out .
too many mistakes have been made here .
life is very difficult . "
return to the top and send your questions zeynab , teacher , baghdad zeynab -lrb- far right -rrb- with colleagues at the primary school where she teaches primary school teacher zeynab spends all her spare time at home because that is where she feels safest .
" the moment i step out of my home to go to work i am overcome by fear .
i can never be sure if i will return home again .
" maybe it will be a car bomb or a suicide bomber or a roadside bomb , " she says .
she fears for her children 's safety , too .
" nowhere is safe now .
we hear about explosions in mosques , churches and schools . "
she moved her son from his secondary school because the school guard and one of the students was killed .
despite the dangers zeynab chooses to stay at her school and teach young children because she wants to play her role in rebuilding iraq .
but , she says , only when foreign troops leave iraq , will iraqis like her be able to rebuild the country for themselves .
return to the top and send your questions mateen dooski , unemployed , dohuk , northern iraq mateen dooski , a 50 year old kurd , is currently unemployed after completing the construction of a commercial building which he oversaw .
i could work for the government but the wages are low and there is so much corruption .
mateen dooski " it was a big headache , " he says .
" it 's hard to get materials and the labour market has boomed so there is a shortage of workers and they demand high wages . "
despite no job , mateen manages to support his wife , who is a teacher , and five sons , aged from 10 to 22 with a pension from his teaching days , and properties that he lets out .
but finding a good job which is well paid is difficult .
" i was offered a post with the un high commissioner for refugees but i could not travel to irbil which is two hours away .
i could work for the government but the wages are low and there is so much corruption . "
he says the boredom is the worst thing about not working .
mateen tries to fill his time by spending time with family , watching the news and researching new projects or perhaps a new job .
although security is relatively good in dohuk , a popular iraqi holiday destination , mateen says that the level of services is worsening and fuel shortages mean everyday life is severely affected .
return to the top and send your questions essam hamoudi , 26 , army translator , samawa essam hamoudi believes that coalition forces bring security to iraq essam hamoudi was delighted when us forces reached the southern town of samawa in 2003 .
" i regard their arrival as a liberation and not an invasion , " he says .
" we were in a state of degradation , ruled by a state which insulted us and treated us with no dignity or respect . "
from the first his encounters with the occupying forces were positive .
the us troops arrived at a time when there was no water in samawa .
essam says they were invaluable in helping to provide such basic resources .
according to essam , samawa has already seen the benefits of the foreign investment in iraq in the form of a brand new barracks for the army .
he works as a translator to the foreign army personnel who train officers in the iraqi army .
a devout shia muslim , he lives with his parents and four brothers and is engaged to be married .
his biggest hope for the future is prosperity and security for iraq - he is optimistic that his wish will be granted in his lifetime .

a secular sunni , sa 'ad grew up in a military neighbourhood of baghdad .
he says that life for everybody revolved around war .
when the iran-iraq war finally ended in 1988 , " we thought it was going to be heaven . "

i can never be sure if i will return home again .
" maybe it will be a car bomb or a suicide bomber or a roadside bomb , " she says .
she fears for her children 's safety , too .
" nowhere is safe now .
we hear about explosions in mosques , churches and schools . "
she moved her son from his secondary school because the school guard and one of the students was killed .
despite the dangers zeynab chooses to stay at her school and teach young children because she wants to play her role in rebuilding iraq .

a devout shia muslim , he lives with his parents and four brothers and is engaged to be married .

a kidney surgeon in one of baghdad 's busiest hospitals , security is his biggest concern .
he says that many doctors are leaving iraq because life is so dangerous .
" iraq has been handed to people who can not govern .
the us forces have made thousands of mistakes and we are the ones who pay .
they are very unpopular . "
samir used to be able to make the long journey north to visit his family once a week .
as violence has escalated , he can only visit them once a month at best .
" i miss them so much , " he adds .
samir notes that iraq 's new constitution places great emphasis on freedom .
but , for him , freedom of expression means little without the safety that guarantees life .
although he is a sunni , he prefers to be identified as a muslim .
he is cynical about the new breed of politicians vying for power in iraq .

despite its defects there was a police force , a real army , " he says .

after living in a free country for so long i miss the simple pleasures of freedom layla al-khafaji she now works for the united iraqi alliance , the electoral coalition that got the most votes in the 2005 election .

when the iran-iraq war finally ended in 1988 , " we thought it was going to be heaven . "

samir ali , 31 , doctor , baghdad samir left his home town of kirkuk in northern iraq 13 years ago to study medicine in baghdad .
a kidney surgeon in one of baghdad 's busiest hospitals , security is his biggest concern .
he says that many doctors are leaving iraq because life is so dangerous .
" iraq has been handed to people who can not govern .
the us forces have made thousands of mistakes and we are the ones who pay .
they are very unpopular . "
samir used to be able to make the long journey north to visit his family once a week .
as violence has escalated , he can only visit them once a month at best .
" i miss them so much , " he adds .
samir notes that iraq 's new constitution places great emphasis on freedom .
but , for him , freedom of expression means little without the safety that guarantees life .
although he is a sunni , he prefers to be identified as a muslim .
he is cynical about the new breed of politicians vying for power in iraq .
" at least under saddam hussein we had a good life in some respects .
despite its defects there was a police force , a real army , " he says .
" these days , you only have yourself for protection . "
layla al-khafaji , 40s , political worker , baghdad layla al-khafaji returned to baghdad last year after living in exile in canada for 14 years .
after finishing college in the 1980s , she was targeted to join the ba 'ath party .
as a shia , her refusal led to her being imprisoned for 10 years before she fled the country . "
after living in a free country for so long i miss the simple pleasures of freedom " layla al-khafaji she now works for the united iraqi alliance , the electoral coalition that got the most votes in the 2005 election .
layla believes the key to building democracy in iraq is making the political process transparent to the public .
" there are people from saddam 's government who are trying to reinvent themselves to get back into government - but nobody trusts these people . "
outside work , socialising is difficult for someone with her profile and she spends most of her time with her family at home .
" because i have been on the tv a few times , i can not go out .
even if i want to buy a pair of shoes , i have to send someone out to get them for me . "
" after living in a free country for so long i miss the simple pleasures of freedom , " she says .
" like being able to walk , or to breathe fresh air . "
sa 'ad al-izzi , 32 , journalist , baghdad after the us-led invasion , sa 'ad al-izzi became a journalist because he wanted to tell the world the real story about iraq .
" unlike foreign correspondents i can walk around freely and so i report the tales of friends , relatives and ordinary people in the street , " he says .
a secular sunni , sa 'ad grew up in a military neighbourhood of baghdad .
he says that life for everybody revolved around war .
when the iran-iraq war finally ended in 1988 , " we thought it was going to be heaven . "
but his family 's optimism vanished with the invasion of kuwait three years later and the ensuing hardship of international embargoes and sanctions .
hopes ran high once again after saddam hussein fell from power , he adds .
but sa 'ad believes that violence and lawlessness during the occupation have made life far worse for many .
he lives with his mother and sister and worries constantly about their safety .
his sister has witnessed gun fights in the streets and narrowly escaped a car bomb explosion .
curfew confines him to his home in the evenings .
" after sunset , i go a little crazy as i ca n't go out .
too many mistakes have been made here .
life is very difficult . "
zeynab , teacher , baghdad primary school teacher zeynab spends all her spare time at home because that is where she feels safest .
" the moment i step out of my home to go to work i am overcome by fear .
i can never be sure if i will return home again .
" maybe it will be a car bomb or a suicide bomber or a roadside bomb , " she says .
she fears for her children 's safety , too .
" nowhere is safe now .
we hear about explosions in mosques , churches and schools . "
she moved her son from his secondary school because the school guard and one of the students was killed .
despite the dangers zeynab chooses to stay at her school and teach young children because she wants to play her role in rebuilding iraq .
but , she says , only when foreign troops leave iraq , will iraqis like her be able to rebuild the country for themselves .
mateen dooski , unemployed , dohuk , northern iraq mateen dooski , a 50 year old kurd , is currently unemployed after completing the construction of a commercial building which he oversaw . "
i could work for the government but the wages are low and there is so much corruption . "
mateen dooski " it was a big headache , " he says .
" it 's hard to get materials and the labour market has boomed so there is a shortage of workers and they demand high wages . "
despite no job , mateen manages to support his wife , who is a teacher , and five sons , aged from 10 to 22 with a pension from his teaching days , and properties that he lets out .
but finding a good job which is well paid is difficult .
" i was offered a post with the un high commissioner for refugees but i could not travel to irbil which is two hours away .
i could work for the government but the wages are low and there is so much corruption . "
he says the boredom is the worst thing about not working .
mateen tries to fill his time by spending time with family , watching the news and researching new projects or perhaps a new job .
although security is relatively good in dohuk , a popular iraqi holiday destination , mateen says that the level of services is worsening and fuel shortages mean everyday life is severely affected .
essam hamoudi , 26 , army translator , samawa essam hamoudi was delighted when us forces reached the southern town of samawa in 2003 .
" i regard their arrival as a liberation and not an invasion , " he says .
" we were in a state of degradation , ruled by a state which insulted us and treated us with no dignity or respect . "
from the first his encounters with the occupying forces were positive .
the us troops arrived at a time when there was no water in samawa .
essam says they were invaluable in helping to provide such basic resources .
according to essam , samawa has already seen the benefits of the foreign investment in iraq in the form of a brand new barracks for the army .
he works as a translator to the foreign army personnel who train officers in the iraqi army .
a devout shia muslim , he lives with his parents and four brothers and is engaged to be married .
his biggest hope for the future is prosperity and security for iraq - he is optimistic that his wish will be granted in his lifetime .

performed by a cast of 80 israeli actors in hebrew , mel brooks ' broadway farce the producers is taking israel by storm .
every night at the cameri theatre , musical-goers pack out the 920-seat venue to see dancing fuehrers and brown-shirts decked out in swastikas .
in an irony that mr brooks would probably appreciate , the musical - whose plot revolves around two producers ' plan to stage a nazi musical which will crash at the box office - is set to extend its original run by another 100 shows .
" if there 's one place in the world that has full licence to make fun of hitler , it 's here , " says the israeli director of the musical , micah levensohn .
" you hear wagner on the radio , we see holocaust documentaries almost every night on the tv , so why not show the producers ? "
while some israelis may find the prospect of a musical that features nazis distasteful , itzak cohen , who plays hitler in the show , says the producers does not make light of events in the world war ii .
i think for those who suffered in the camps or had loved ones that died during the war this would be too much chanan landau " the producers makes fun of everyone : old women , gay people , blondes , jews , producers and nazis .
i 'm making a mockery out of hitler .
i look a super-sized hitler - a hitler meets mcdonalds , " says the portly actor , sitting in his mirrored dressing room backstage .
the cameri theatre had been trying to perform the producers for years but it was only last year that it secured the rights , says theatre manager noam semel .
mixed reactions while mr semel says that " jewish audiences are very sophisticated " , he admits that some small changes were made to the producers in rehearsals to avoid unnecessarily upsetting people .
the musical is set to run for another 100 shows whenever the jewish characters bialystock and bloom mention the word " hitler " they spit and say the ancient hebrew curse " yimakh shmo " -lrb- " may his name be erased " -rrb- .
the put-downs of nazism are also more pointed than the original broadway production .
theatre staff were braced for protests on the opening night but they never materialised .
" we had never had a comedy involving hitler , " says mr levensohn , standing backstage after the show .
" but i was pleasantly surprised that nobody protested . "
but some of the audience who attended a performance of the producers say it was not to their taste .
chanan landau , 83 , and his wife rachael , 81 , fled germany in 1933 , the year hitler came to power .
they say that the musical would make uncomfortable viewing for some of their friends .
i think it 's important because it gives you a perspective of life ...
it shows that we 're survivors rutz aknin " i think for those who suffered in the camps or had loved ones that died during the war this would be too much , " says mr landau , " even if it does n't bother me . "
" while it was 60 years ago , there will never be enough time of these people to get over it , " adds his wife .
but rutz aknin says showing the producers in tel aviv shows that israeli society has moved on in the last 60 years .
" i think it 's important because it gives you a perspective of life .

in an irony that mr brooks would probably appreciate , the musical - whose plot revolves around two producers ' plan to stage a nazi musical which will crash at the box office - is set to extend its original run by another 100 shows .
" if there 's one place in the world that has full licence to make fun of hitler , it 's here , " says the israeli director of the musical , micah levensohn .
" you hear wagner on the radio , we see holocaust documentaries almost every night on the tv , so why not show the producers ? "
while some israelis may find the prospect of a musical that features nazis distasteful , itzak cohen , who plays hitler in the show , says the producers does not make light of events in the world war ii .
i think for those who suffered in the camps or had loved ones that died during the war this would be too much chanan landau " the producers makes fun of everyone : old women , gay people , blondes , jews , producers and nazis .
i 'm making a mockery out of hitler .
i look a super-sized hitler - a hitler meets mcdonalds , " says the portly actor , sitting in his mirrored dressing room backstage .
the cameri theatre had been trying to perform the producers for years but it was only last year that it secured the rights , says theatre manager noam semel .
mixed reactions while mr semel says that " jewish audiences are very sophisticated " , he admits that some small changes were made to the producers in rehearsals to avoid unnecessarily upsetting people .
the musical is set to run for another 100 shows whenever the jewish characters bialystock and bloom mention the word " hitler " they spit and say the ancient hebrew curse " yimakh shmo " -lrb- " may his name be erased " -rrb- .
the put-downs of nazism are also more pointed than the original broadway production .
theatre staff were braced for protests on the opening night but they never materialised .
" we had never had a comedy involving hitler , " says mr levensohn , standing backstage after the show .
" but i was pleasantly surprised that nobody protested . "
but some of the audience who attended a performance of the producers say it was not to their taste .
chanan landau , 83 , and his wife rachael , 81 , fled germany in 1933 , the year hitler came to power .
they say that the musical would make uncomfortable viewing for some of their friends .
i think it 's important because it gives you a perspective of life ...
it shows that we 're survivors rutz aknin " i think for those who suffered in the camps or had loved ones that died during the war this would be too much , " says mr landau , " even if it does n't bother me . "
" while it was 60 years ago , there will never be enough time of these people to get over it , " adds his wife .
but rutz aknin says showing the producers in tel aviv shows that israeli society has moved on in the last 60 years .
" i think it 's important because it gives you a perspective of life .
now that we can laugh about hitler and this makes us a stronger , " says the 51-year-old .
" it shows that we 're survivors . "

here , samiah ilamdi , 40 , a social worker from amadia , near dohuk , describes her work at a shelter for women who have suffered from domestic abuse . "
i 'm normally at work by 8am at the women 's rehabilitation and preparation centre in dohuk that i manage .
the big problem here is that traditionally women do not have rights .
many women are prisoners within their family and are not allowed to be human .
some women have been killed by their relatives for the crime of falling in love .
religion makes big problems , it does n't allow women to live their lives and they have to live like a servant .
for some , if they do n't cover their face , they are n't allowed to go to college , to socialise , to choose a husband by themself or even to have a job and many suffer from violence .
women in iraq do n't get to plan for the future - their family plan their lives for them .
more daily lives waria , businessman elwan , sculptor tara , ophthalmologist majid , teacher um mustufa , hairdresser yousif , gravedigger abdul , foreign worker ' lulu ' , civil engineer hawija policeman abu ali , falluja resident in kurdistan we have made many changes in the law to make it a better place for women to live compared to the rest of iraq .
at the shelter we try to give women a choice .
we offer them refuge and a place to think .
we can help them with a lawyer to divorce their husband .
there is also a teacher to help with education - many of the women are illiterate .
there is training available as well as help in finding a job .
they also get taught the law so they realise the modern role of women in society .
we also do this work in schools , allowing young women to protect themselves by knowing their rights .
on the run i have a girl , aged 10 , and two boys , 8 and 6 .
my husband is very supportive now about me working , but i had to make him understand .
i take my responsibilities at home seriously - i always cook my family their meals .
after my father 's home in kurdistan was blown-up three times , my family now all live in exile in europe and the us .
i am the only one left . "
three times i have been in prison .
they used to beat us very badly and try to make us sign confessions and ask us why we were not in the ba 'ath party " my husband is now a politician , but he used to be a leader with the peshmerga , for 30 years he lived in the mountains fighting saddam 's regime for 33 years .
saddam put a price on my husband 's head many , many times , but they never got him .
we used to live on the run all the time , living a hard life in the mountains .
three times i have been in prison .
they used to beat us very badly and try to make us sign confessions and ask us why we were not in the ba 'ath party .
but now life is better .
i hope that iraq can grow without saddam and his party or any terrorists .
i hope that women in kurdistan and iraq can help to rebuild iraq alongside their brothers and make their own decisions . "

for some , if they do n't cover their face , they are n't allowed to go to college , to socialise , to choose a husband by themself or even to have a job and many suffer from violence .
women in iraq do n't get to plan for the future - their family plan their lives for them .
more daily lives waria , businessman elwan , sculptor tara , ophthalmologist majid , teacher um mustufa , hairdresser yousif , gravedigger abdul , foreign worker ' lulu ' , civil engineer hawija policeman abu ali , falluja resident in kurdistan we have made many changes in the law to make it a better place for women to live compared to the rest of iraq .
at the shelter we try to give women a choice .
we offer them refuge and a place to think .
we can help them with a lawyer to divorce their husband .
there is also a teacher to help with education - many of the women are illiterate .
there is training available as well as help in finding a job .
they also get taught the law so they realise the modern role of women in society .
we also do this work in schools , allowing young women to protect themselves by knowing their rights .
on the run i have a girl , aged 10 , and two boys , 8 and 6 .
my husband is very supportive now about me working , but i had to make him understand .
i take my responsibilities at home seriously - i always cook my family their meals .
after my father 's home in kurdistan was blown-up three times , my family now all live in exile in europe and the us .
i am the only one left .
three times i have been in prison .
they used to beat us very badly and try to make us sign confessions and ask us why we were not in the ba 'ath party my husband is now a politician , but he used to be a leader with the peshmerga , for 30 years he lived in the mountains fighting saddam 's regime for 33 years .
saddam put a price on my husband 's head many , many times , but they never got him .
we used to live on the run all the time , living a hard life in the mountains .
three times i have been in prison .
they used to beat us very badly and try to make us sign confessions and ask us why we were not in the ba 'ath party .
but now life is better .
i hope that iraq can grow without saddam and his party or any terrorists .
i hope that women in kurdistan and iraq can help to rebuild iraq alongside their brothers and make their own decisions .

many women are prisoners within their family and are not allowed to be human .
some women have been killed by their relatives for the crime of falling in love .
religion makes big problems , it does n't allow women to live their lives and they have to live like a servant .
for some , if they do n't cover their face , they are n't allowed to go to college , to socialise , to choose a husband by themself or even to have a job and many suffer from violence .
women in iraq do n't get to plan for the future - their family plan their lives for them .
more daily lives waria , businessman elwan , sculptor tara , ophthalmologist majid , teacher um mustufa , hairdresser yousif , gravedigger abdul , foreign worker ' lulu ' , civil engineer hawija policeman abu ali , falluja resident in kurdistan we have made many changes in the law to make it a better place for women to live compared to the rest of iraq .
at the shelter we try to give women a choice .
we offer them refuge and a place to think .
we can help them with a lawyer to divorce their husband .
there is also a teacher to help with education - many of the women are illiterate .
there is training available as well as help in finding a job .
they also get taught the law so they realise the modern role of women in society .
we also do this work in schools , allowing young women to protect themselves by knowing their rights .
on the run i have a girl , aged 10 , and two boys , 8 and 6 .
my husband is very supportive now about me working , but i had to make him understand .
i take my responsibilities at home seriously - i always cook my family their meals .
after my father 's home in kurdistan was blown-up three times , my family now all live in exile in europe and the us .
i am the only one left .
three times i have been in prison .
they used to beat us very badly and try to make us sign confessions and ask us why we were not in the ba 'ath party my husband is now a politician , but he used to be a leader with the peshmerga , for 30 years he lived in the mountains fighting saddam 's regime for 33 years .
saddam put a price on my husband 's head many , many times , but they never got him .
we used to live on the run all the time , living a hard life in the mountains .
three times i have been in prison .
they used to beat us very badly and try to make us sign confessions and ask us why we were not in the ba 'ath party .
but now life is better .
i hope that iraq can grow without saddam and his party or any terrorists .
i hope that women in kurdistan and iraq can help to rebuild iraq alongside their brothers and make their own decisions .

radnorshire wildlife trust said about 500 fewer amorous amphibians had taken advantage of an overnight road closure near a lake in llandrindod wells .
it had been temporarily shut so breeding toads could search for love without being squashed by drivers .
about 1,500 were helped across the road compared to around 2,000 last year .
the mating season ends later this month .
wildlife trust workers carried the toads in buckets during the 15 days the road was closed .
the closure has become an annual occurrence .
julian jones of the trust in llandrindod wells , said 30 march proved the busiest night when 600 toads were assisted .
the lakeside road reopened on 3 april .
the level of consistency triggers something in the toads julian jones mr jones said : " from research , we know the toads need the temperature to be seven degrees celsius and that temperature needs to remain the same for several nights .
" the level of consistency triggers something in the toads .
" we know from research that toads and other amphibians seem sensitive to climate change . "
mr jones speculated that cold early spring weather may have deterred the toads , although their numbers in the area would not be affected next year .
during next year 's mating season ramps may be introduced to allow the toads to walk easily over the road 's curb stones .

as expected , it is holding the talks with eads , the franco-german group that owns the rest of airbus .
" discussions are at an early stage and a further announcement will be made if and when appropriate , " said bae .
it added that there would be no implications for airbus ' 13,000 uk staff if and when a sale goes through .
airbus ' uk operations design and build wings for its fleet of large commercial jets .
the sale would mean there would no longer be any british ownership of the huge manufacturing sites at broughton in north wales and filton near bristol .
focus on the us bae is expected to pocket up to £ 3bn -lrb- $ 5.25bn -rrb- from the sale .
airbus key facts the first ever airbus , an a300 , took off in october 1974 british aerospace joined the consortium in 1979 there are over 3,900 airbus jets in service airbus employs a total of 55,000 staff worldwide airbus turnover in 2005 was £ 15.3bn its chief executive mike turner confirmed that the firm wished to renew its focus on its core defence business , which is rapidly growing in the us .
" we believe that now is the right time for us to divest our airbus shareholding to allow us to concentrate on our core transatlantic defence and aerospace strategy , " said mr turner .
despite bae 's assurance that the uk airbus workforce will not be affected by a sale , unions said they were still concerned .
" we want to find out if production will remain in the uk or whether it will be shifted to countries where the new buyers are based , " said ian waddle , national officer of the amicus union .
airbus recently announced the creation of an extra 650 jobs at the broughton factory in north wales - the region 's biggest manufacturing site with 6,000 staff .
as well as the staff directly employed by airbus in britain , as many as 135,000 jobs at uk suppliers are thought to depend on it .
airbus sold a record 1,055 planes last year , giving it a larger share of new orders than us rival boeing .
global operations the airbus range includes the a350 , launched in october last year and due to enter into service in 2010 .
earlier this week , airbus unveiled the a350 's new interior , designed in collaboration with london-based firm priestman goode , at a trade fair in the german city of hamburg .
despite a bumper year for airbus sales in 2005 , bae 's commercial aerospace division saw its overall profits fall to £ 179m from £ 201m a year earlier because of weak demand for its regional jets .
bae 's move towards concentrating on its defence operations was reflected by last year 's acquisition of us firm united defense for £ 2.1bn.
its american operations now account for 35 % of bae 's total £ 14.8bn annual sales .
bae employs 90,000 people globally .

here , abu ali -lrb- not his real name -rrb- talks about the situation in the city of falluja , which has been a hotbed of resistance to the us-led occupation .
so much of the rights and aspirations and the work of the iraqi people has gone to waste from day one of the fall of baghdad .
iraqi citizens watch every day as their civilisation is destroyed and their institutions robbed , right under the nose of the occupation .
immense tragedy awaits our country .
this is what we and all lovers of our civilisation feel , regardless of people 's opinion of the former regime .
from day one of the occupation , there has been a feeling of the loss of our homeland .
we in falluja feel for baghdad , in all her suffering and future and great spirit .
we feel for her acutely .
no iraqi can ever accept his country being robbed and destroyed , regardless of political orientation .
falluja has paid a huge price for the position it took .
and this position is well worth the price we paid .
we chose to defend our country .
the first four us armoured vehicles entered falluja at precisely 1215 on 23 april 2003 .
i was there , and it was one of the most difficult moments in my entire life .
i tried to look away .
more daily lives waria , businessman elwan , sculptor tara , ophthalmologist majid , teacher um mustufa , hairdresser yousif , gravedigger abdul , foreign worker ' lulu ' , civil engineer hawija policeman samiah , social worker they came in quietly , but four days later the first demonstration against the occupation broke out .
it marched to the headquarters of the us forces , was blocked by the americans , and 17 demonstrators were martyred .
this was the first real confrontation with the occupation in falluja .
on the second day , demonstrators protested about what had happened the day before , and again us troops opened fire and three demonstrators were martyred .
preparation for confrontation began .
i was a member of the falluja local assembly , formed after the fall of baghdad .
i was one of 25 senior personalities in the assembly which managed things until october or november of 2003 .
we warned the occupation not to go too far in their mistakes .
we said the reaction would get bigger .
stop your mistakes , we told them .
they only heard the sound of bullets .
' under siege ' the people of falluja have the honour of leading the national resistance against the occupation , and this goes on today .
falluja is now under siege .
entering it is very difficult .
you need documents from the americans to the effect that you are from falluja , and it could take two hours just to get in .
electricity is on for two or three hours a day .
there is no political life .
demonstrations are not allowed .
you need the approval of the americans and the government for any meeting or conference or public meeting .
there is a daily military confrontation .
i feel threatened only by the occupation and iraqi security forces , not by the resistance .
i have five children .
i used to work in trade .
ours is a well-off family , historically .

it added that there would be no implications for airbus ' 13,000 uk staff if and when a sale goes through .

despite bae 's assurance that the uk airbus workforce will not be affected by a sale , unions said they were still concerned .
