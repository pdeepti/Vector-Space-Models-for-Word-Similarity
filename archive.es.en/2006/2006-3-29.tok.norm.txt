but germany still has catching up to do . going by the calculations of the world economic forum , germany 's it sector has its work cut out for it .
after placing 14 in the organization 's internationally-respected it index in 2004-2005 , germany slipped to 17th last year , according to a newly published survey .
the global information technology report , which measures the involvement of a country 's economy in the global information technology network , placed european countries like sweden and iceland ahead of germany .
the us placed first . the news should be incentive enough for the german government to devote full attention to a year-long ministry of education and research program push to promote germany 's it sector in 2006 .
the program includes school competitions designed to recruit the next generation of it workers , a vanishing group in germany . giving the branch direction the program " will raise awareness , it will awake interest in a branch that apparently has a difficult time explaining itself , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of bitkom , germany 's it lobbying organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry suffers from a dearth of qualified candidates the program could also provide the sort of guidance needed in the it industry .
august wilhelm scheer , professor at the institute for economic information at the university of saarbrücken , said the government needs to loosen the reins and give the it branch direction .
" in every country where there 's been a turnaround , be it finland , north ireland , or south korea , there is always a political concept behind it that wants to see the information technology area pushed forward , " he said . following the dot-com bubble burst , and a severe dearth of qualified employees that prompted german politicians to introduce a green card specifically for the it industry , the branch shows signs of recovery .
together with the overall improved economic climate , the munich-based ifo institute 's new economic index on tuesday mentioned an upswing in new jobs in the it sector .
a first good test when it comes to information technology , germany belongs " in the top group with a few other countries , " said matthias jarke , the head of the renowned fraunhofer institute for applied information technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial electronic toll collect system malfunctioned and was widely panned to prove it , germany this year plans to introduce a new health care card that is outfitted with a chip filled with comprehensive patient information .
the most advanced card of its kind in the world will link an estimated 80 million cards with two million completely different systems located in hospitals , doctor 's and insurance offices . " such … projects always have a positive effect on exports , " jarke said .
should the country pull it off , that is : a similar national effort to build high-tech toll collection system spearheaded by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler had major problems before it was finally introduced in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's quaero project aims to challenge google some europeans are concerned about us hegemony in the worldwide information market .

" mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.03.2006 primor : israeli talks with hamas could begin soon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small steps on daily issues will lead way to peace , according to primor congratulated by german chancellor angela merkel , ehud olmert is expected to put together a government quickly .
soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .
there is a large majority for these ideas between the center and left parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's action after the election could differ from his campaign ehud olmert made an announcement to the palestinians on the evening of the elections .
how will the new israeli government act toward the hamas administration ? during the campaigns the top candidates from all the parties said , " we will never speak with the hamas movement or a hamas government . "
that means we will have absolutely no negotiations with the palestinians since they would be conducted by a hamas government .
if anything we could only have one-sided developments . that was necessitated by the election .
as soon as the election was over , even the designated president ehud olmert said , " yes , we want to negotiate with the palestinians . "
he did not mention hamas specifically but who else would he negotiate with , if not the democratically elected palestinian government ?
he wants to negotiate with the palestinians and the labor party will force him to in any case .
and he said that only when the talks fail would we consider unilateral action such as pulling out of the occupied territories .
so things look optimistic . what time frame do you see these negotiations having before ehud olmert says he 's unilaterally pulling out ? there will not be direct negotiations right away because no one wants to lie to themselves . the israelis in terms of the hamas movement and the hamas movement in terms of their ideology not to recognize israel and to destroy israel .
it is going to become bit more complicated .
we would expect mediatory help behind the scenes from the egyptians dealing with the practical and pragmatic issues that have to do with daily life - especially improvements to the palestinians ' living conditions in the occupied territories . that will gradually develop into a peace process .
i do not know how long it will take , but i can say that it is in the interest of both sides .
the hamas movement needs israel to satisfy the palestinians who want improved living conditions right away .
and israel needs peace .
that is what the hamas movement can provide .
in august 2004 it put a ceasefire into effect and respected it .
attacks in israel today are conducted by other groups , not the hamas movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incoming hamas palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh needs to stick to the ceasefire i think pragmatic contact to solve daily problems will begin right away - as soon as the coalition is formed .
the egyptians will make sure it happens .
no on can predict hzow quickly that develops into a peace process . what can the new hamas government do now ? for israel there is one criteria and that is peace .
if hamas does not only keep to and respect its ceasefire but also as a government keeps other extremist groups in check , not to say to combat them , then that would be a sign to the israeli government . how do you interpret the ultra-nationalists ' good results ? the right has not disappeared .
the people who are right extremists or right nationalists or religious rightists still exist .
they are a little weaker and fewer in number , but they have not disappeared .
only the division of votes is a little different .
a different extreme right party profited when the likud party lost so much .
this is a different separation inside of the right . klaudia prevezanos interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de olmert claims israel victory , looks for partners despite capturing the most votes in israel 's election , ehud olmert 's kadima party will have to turn to partners to form a wider coalition if it wants to push ahead with fixing israel 's final borders .

" mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .

one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ? up until now , germany 's grand coalition of social democrats and conservative cdu / csu parties has been slow to tackle major reforms . chancellor angela merkel has instead reveled in her winning appearances on the international stage .
political aides waited patiently for last sunday 's three major state elections to pass . this wednesday evening , the waiting will be over .
merkel will meet with the coalition 's political elite to reach agreement on one of the country 's most pressing and complicated reform projects : the health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel , still eye to eye ?
next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . social democrats , conservatives far apart the differences between the two sides remain wide . the social democrats have favored a system which abolishes the division between public and private health care .
critics say patients with private insurance receive preferential treatment .
their " citizen 's insurance " would mean that every insurance company would be required to insure every citizen regardless of risk , but would also eliminate tax loopholes for big-earners and freelancers .
the fees would depend on income .
the higher a person 's salary , the higher the rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias platzeck has laid down some rules the conservatives are absolutely against the idea .
they want a solidarity-based system that would require every adult to pay the same insurance fee regardless of income . rather than abolish the public-private divide in health insurance , the conservatives would seek to increase competition between the two . spd leader matthias platzeck , who will be taking part in the meetings wednesday night , has already marked out a few " do-not-cross " lines , including no drastic cutbacks in services and leaving open the possibility of increasing the employer 's share of the monthly premium .
he also ruled out the conservatives ' solidarity-based system . going for some " basic understanding " but the spd has shown itself open to the conservative plan to finance childrens ' health insurance through taxes .
whether there is any money in state coffers for that sort of solidarity is anybody 's guess . the divide between the two major parties continues to be wide - but merkel and her coalition counterparts , labor minister franz müntefering and platzeck , have already shown they are willing to compromise : they were able to form the government coalition in the first place .

although it won the most seats of any party , the outcome was far less than what opinion polls had forecast ahead of the ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert visits the west bank olmert , who shot to power only 12 weeks ago when prime minister ariel sharon suffered a massive stroke , campaigned on a plan to dismantle dozens of settlements and remove tens of thousands of jews from the west bank .
even though a majority of the members of parliament -lrb- mp -rrb- favors some kind of pullout from the west bank , which has been occupied by israel for nearly 40 years , olmert will be hard pressed to find a suitable coalition partner to achieve his ambitious goal of separating from the palestinians and establishing the final borders of the jewish state . possible partners the center-left labor party , predicted to emerge as the second force in parliament , garnered 20 seats .
it now looks forward to extracting social and economic concessions in exchange for joining the government with kadima .

olmert will also most likely have to bring in the parliament 's two ultra-orthodox factions to secure enough seats in his coalition . the possible inclusion of he two religious parties shas and united torah judaism could make the coalition difficult as the two will likely want to ensure religious jews maintain the benefits and privileges so despised by meretz and unpopular with labor . however , robert rosenberg of haaretz newspaper told afp news sources that olmert " can rapidly form a relatively stable coalition , with the core comprised of kadima , labor and the pensioners , with meretz , united torah judaism and possibly shas on board . " redrawing israel 's borders what has become clear in the hours following the election is that the nationalist right that has dominated power since 1977 will be frozen out of the next government after likud , the traditional champion of the right , suffered a crushing defeat .

these elections are seen first and foremost as a referendum on the partitioning of land , " said political commentator ari shavit on israel 's channel one television . bildunterschrift : the removal of settlements is a major goal of kadima when all possible cooperating parties are taken together , those supporting a withdrawal from the west bank and a permanent definition of israel 's borders outweigh the opponents from the far-right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.03.2006 olmert claims israel victory , looks for partners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election was largely a vote on the drawing of israel 's borders despite capturing the most votes in israel 's election , ehud olmert 's kadima party will have to turn to partners to form a wider coalition if it wants to push ahead with fixing israel 's final borders . with 99.7 percent of polling stations accounted for , acting prime minister ehud olmert 's kadima party looks set to take 28 of 120 seats in parliament , the israel election commission reported early wednesday .
although it won the most seats of any party , the outcome was far less than what opinion polls had forecast ahead of the ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert visits the west bank olmert , who shot to power only 12 weeks ago when prime minister ariel sharon suffered a massive stroke , campaigned on a plan to dismantle dozens of settlements and remove tens of thousands of jews from the west bank .
even though a majority of the members of parliament -lrb- mp -rrb- favors some kind of pullout from the west bank , which has been occupied by israel for nearly 40 years , olmert will be hard pressed to find a suitable coalition partner to achieve his ambitious goal of separating from the palestinians and establishing the final borders of the jewish state . possible partners the center-left labor party , predicted to emerge as the second force in parliament , garnered 20 seats .
it now looks forward to extracting social and economic concessions in exchange for joining the government with kadima .
led by amir peretzs , the party has also made clear it would prefer a negotiated solution with the palestinians to unilateral steps as favored by kadima . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor party leader amir peretz between them kadima and labor lack enough seats to form a majority on their own and will have to look for partners among some of the smaller factions , including the fledgling pensioners ' list and the left-wing , secular meretz party .
olmert will also most likely have to bring in the parliament 's two ultra-orthodox factions to secure enough seats in his coalition . the possible inclusion of he two religious parties shas and united torah judaism could make the coalition difficult as the two will likely want to ensure religious jews maintain the benefits and privileges so despised by meretz and unpopular with labor . however , robert rosenberg of haaretz newspaper told afp news sources that olmert " can rapidly form a relatively stable coalition , with the core comprised of kadima , labor and the pensioners , with meretz , united torah judaism and possibly shas on board . " redrawing israel 's borders what has become clear in the hours following the election is that the nationalist right that has dominated power since 1977 will be frozen out of the next government after likud , the traditional champion of the right , suffered a crushing defeat . " the strength of kadima has managed to destroy the right wing .
these elections are seen first and foremost as a referendum on the partitioning of land , " said political commentator ari shavit on israel 's channel one television . bildunterschrift : the removal of settlements is a major goal of kadima when all possible cooperating parties are taken together , those supporting a withdrawal from the west bank and a permanent definition of israel 's borders outweigh the opponents from the far-right .
" this plan has close to 80 seats .
two thirds of the people !
that 's the most dramatic thing that happened , " boasted incoming kadima mp haim ramon after televisions published their exit polls . " the left is now two-thirds of the knesset .
if olmert has the courage , he can dismantle the settlements and make peace and retreat , as he wants .

but in an article in wednesday 's handelsblatt newspaper , müntefering announced that he was stopping the reform , accusing the conservative parties of wanting too much . " i stopped it after parts of the union parties began taking steps away from this point in the coalition agreement , " he wrote . unions invoke french protests conservative economics minister michael glos said earlier in the week that the dismantling of germany 's strict job protection laws does n't go far enough , echoing similar complaints in parts of the christian democratic union , and christian social union parties .

big mistake . after " moni "'s friend was fired after her new job 's trial period - not an uncommon occurrence in a country with over five million unemployed - she , like the thousands germany 's bloggers who share their personal details with anyone willing to read them , took a few minutes to put the particulars on her blog , gedankenträger . that 's when the transparency international germany set the lawyers loose . the group that dedicates itself to opening all government and business books for anyone to have a look demanded no one cast as much as quick gaze at the blog post describing the way moni 's friend was fired and threatened legal action if the single , unemployed mother did n't remove the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bloggers caused a headache for the transparency international pr machine no open arms waiting for moni " i assume you are aware of the legal as well as the financial consequences that would result for you , " the letter stated . moni posted the letter , too . though she deleted the lawyer 's name and the organization that sent it , the ti lawyers were not to be stopped and a second letter threatening legal action if the entry was n't removed landed on moni 's doorstep , claiming the second entry broke copyright laws . " to be honest i had actually expected that they would welcome a critical comment , " moni told netzeitung.de.
" after all , transparency international , as anyone can read on their web site , explicitly approves whistle blowing . " bloggers take to the case the lawyers might have been well-instructed to have left the long-ago archived post that had all but entered the internet ether alone .
it ended up being the organization 's response that convinced dozens of german bloggers to expose a double standard in a group set on to bring light to the dark corners of bureaucracy .
they reprinted the letter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing a trip before the judge , moni removed the posts apparently ti did n't enjoying being the most searched-for term at technorati.com , a blog search engine , and has since decided against pressing legal charges against moni , ti germany 's general manger dagmar schröder told tagesschau.de . " we simply asked our lawyer to get involved in the case , " she said .
" it 's definitely possible to debate if the extent of the action was appropriate . " when asked what ti 's next steps would be , jochen bäumel , a ti board member , replied " nothing . " " it does n't matter what we do , it will be wrong , " he added .
" maybe we should n't have reacted at all .

soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .
there is a large majority for these ideas between the center and left parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's action after the election could differ from his campaign ehud olmert made an announcement to the palestinians on the evening of the elections .
how will the new israeli government act toward the hamas administration ? during the campaigns the top candidates from all the parties said , " we will never speak with the hamas movement or a hamas government . "
that means we will have absolutely no negotiations with the palestinians since they would be conducted by a hamas government .
if anything we could only have one-sided developments . that was necessitated by the election .
as soon as the election was over , even the designated president ehud olmert said , " yes , we want to negotiate with the palestinians . "
he did not mention hamas specifically but who else would he negotiate with , if not the democratically elected palestinian government ?
he wants to negotiate with the palestinians and the labor party will force him to in any case .
and he said that only when the talks fail would we consider unilateral action such as pulling out of the occupied territories .
so things look optimistic . what time frame do you see these negotiations having before ehud olmert says he 's unilaterally pulling out ? there will not be direct negotiations right away because no one wants to lie to themselves . the israelis in terms of the hamas movement and the hamas movement in terms of their ideology not to recognize israel and to destroy israel .
it is going to become bit more complicated .
we would expect mediatory help behind the scenes from the egyptians dealing with the practical and pragmatic issues that have to do with daily life - especially improvements to the palestinians ' living conditions in the occupied territories . that will gradually develop into a peace process .
i do not know how long it will take , but i can say that it is in the interest of both sides .
the hamas movement needs israel to satisfy the palestinians who want improved living conditions right away .
and israel needs peace .
that is what the hamas movement can provide .
in august 2004 it put a ceasefire into effect and respected it .
attacks in israel today are conducted by other groups , not the hamas movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incoming hamas palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh needs to stick to the ceasefire i think pragmatic contact to solve daily problems will begin right away - as soon as the coalition is formed .
the egyptians will make sure it happens .
no on can predict hzow quickly that develops into a peace process . what can the new hamas government do now ? for israel there is one criteria and that is peace .
if hamas does not only keep to and respect its ceasefire but also as a government keeps other extremist groups in check , not to say to combat them , then that would be a sign to the israeli government . how do you interpret the ultra-nationalists ' good results ? the right has not disappeared .
the people who are right extremists or right nationalists or religious rightists still exist .
they are a little weaker and fewer in number , but they have not disappeared .
only the division of votes is a little different .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.03.2006 primor : israeli talks with hamas could begin soon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small steps on daily issues will lead way to peace , according to primor congratulated by german chancellor angela merkel , ehud olmert is expected to put together a government quickly .
soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .
there is a large majority for these ideas between the center and left parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's action after the election could differ from his campaign ehud olmert made an announcement to the palestinians on the evening of the elections .
how will the new israeli government act toward the hamas administration ? during the campaigns the top candidates from all the parties said , " we will never speak with the hamas movement or a hamas government . "
that means we will have absolutely no negotiations with the palestinians since they would be conducted by a hamas government .
if anything we could only have one-sided developments . that was necessitated by the election .
as soon as the election was over , even the designated president ehud olmert said , " yes , we want to negotiate with the palestinians . "
he did not mention hamas specifically but who else would he negotiate with , if not the democratically elected palestinian government ?
he wants to negotiate with the palestinians and the labor party will force him to in any case .
and he said that only when the talks fail would we consider unilateral action such as pulling out of the occupied territories .
so things look optimistic . what time frame do you see these negotiations having before ehud olmert says he 's unilaterally pulling out ? there will not be direct negotiations right away because no one wants to lie to themselves . the israelis in terms of the hamas movement and the hamas movement in terms of their ideology not to recognize israel and to destroy israel .
it is going to become bit more complicated .
we would expect mediatory help behind the scenes from the egyptians dealing with the practical and pragmatic issues that have to do with daily life - especially improvements to the palestinians ' living conditions in the occupied territories . that will gradually develop into a peace process .
i do not know how long it will take , but i can say that it is in the interest of both sides .
the hamas movement needs israel to satisfy the palestinians who want improved living conditions right away .
and israel needs peace .
that is what the hamas movement can provide .
in august 2004 it put a ceasefire into effect and respected it .
attacks in israel today are conducted by other groups , not the hamas movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incoming hamas palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh needs to stick to the ceasefire i think pragmatic contact to solve daily problems will begin right away - as soon as the coalition is formed .
the egyptians will make sure it happens .
no on can predict hzow quickly that develops into a peace process . what can the new hamas government do now ? for israel there is one criteria and that is peace .
if hamas does not only keep to and respect its ceasefire but also as a government keeps other extremist groups in check , not to say to combat them , then that would be a sign to the israeli government . how do you interpret the ultra-nationalists ' good results ? the right has not disappeared .
the people who are right extremists or right nationalists or religious rightists still exist .
they are a little weaker and fewer in number , but they have not disappeared .
only the division of votes is a little different .
a different extreme right party profited when the likud party lost so much .
this is a different separation inside of the right . klaudia prevezanos interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de olmert claims israel victory , looks for partners despite capturing the most votes in israel 's election , ehud olmert 's kadima party will have to turn to partners to form a wider coalition if it wants to push ahead with fixing israel 's final borders .

" mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .
reding hopes the european commission will adopt the proposal in june , following further consultation . jane conway -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's telefonica launches takeover bid for o2 spanish telecoms giant telefonica launched a friendly cash bid of 26.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- for british group 02 that also operates in germany , according to a joint statement released on monday .

but germany still has catching up to do . going by the calculations of the world economic forum , germany 's it sector has its work cut out for it .
after placing 14 in the organization 's internationally-respected it index in 2004-2005 , germany slipped to 17th last year , according to a newly published survey .
the global information technology report , which measures the involvement of a country 's economy in the global information technology network , placed european countries like sweden and iceland ahead of germany .
the us placed first . the news should be incentive enough for the german government to devote full attention to a year-long ministry of education and research program push to promote germany 's it sector in 2006 .
the program includes school competitions designed to recruit the next generation of it workers , a vanishing group in germany . giving the branch direction the program " will raise awareness , it will awake interest in a branch that apparently has a difficult time explaining itself , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of bitkom , germany 's it lobbying organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry suffers from a dearth of qualified candidates the program could also provide the sort of guidance needed in the it industry .
august wilhelm scheer , professor at the institute for economic information at the university of saarbrücken , said the government needs to loosen the reins and give the it branch direction .
" in every country where there 's been a turnaround , be it finland , north ireland , or south korea , there is always a political concept behind it that wants to see the information technology area pushed forward , " he said . following the dot-com bubble burst , and a severe dearth of qualified employees that prompted german politicians to introduce a green card specifically for the it industry , the branch shows signs of recovery .
together with the overall improved economic climate , the munich-based ifo institute 's new economic index on tuesday mentioned an upswing in new jobs in the it sector .
a first good test when it comes to information technology , germany belongs " in the top group with a few other countries , " said matthias jarke , the head of the renowned fraunhofer institute for applied information technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial electronic toll collect system malfunctioned and was widely panned to prove it , germany this year plans to introduce a new health care card that is outfitted with a chip filled with comprehensive patient information .
the most advanced card of its kind in the world will link an estimated 80 million cards with two million completely different systems located in hospitals , doctor 's and insurance offices . " such … projects always have a positive effect on exports , " jarke said .

" mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .

one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ? up until now , germany 's grand coalition of social democrats and conservative cdu / csu parties has been slow to tackle major reforms . chancellor angela merkel has instead reveled in her winning appearances on the international stage .
political aides waited patiently for last sunday 's three major state elections to pass . this wednesday evening , the waiting will be over .
merkel will meet with the coalition 's political elite to reach agreement on one of the country 's most pressing and complicated reform projects : the health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel , still eye to eye ?
next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . social democrats , conservatives far apart the differences between the two sides remain wide . the social democrats have favored a system which abolishes the division between public and private health care .
critics say patients with private insurance receive preferential treatment .
their " citizen 's insurance " would mean that every insurance company would be required to insure every citizen regardless of risk , but would also eliminate tax loopholes for big-earners and freelancers .
the fees would depend on income .
the higher a person 's salary , the higher the rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias platzeck has laid down some rules the conservatives are absolutely against the idea .
they want a solidarity-based system that would require every adult to pay the same insurance fee regardless of income . rather than abolish the public-private divide in health insurance , the conservatives would seek to increase competition between the two . spd leader matthias platzeck , who will be taking part in the meetings wednesday night , has already marked out a few " do-not-cross " lines , including no drastic cutbacks in services and leaving open the possibility of increasing the employer 's share of the monthly premium .

even though a majority of the members of parliament -lrb- mp -rrb- favors some kind of pullout from the west bank , which has been occupied by israel for nearly 40 years , olmert will be hard pressed to find a suitable coalition partner to achieve his ambitious goal of separating from the palestinians and establishing the final borders of the jewish state . possible partners the center-left labor party , predicted to emerge as the second force in parliament , garnered 20 seats .

olmert will also most likely have to bring in the parliament 's two ultra-orthodox factions to secure enough seats in his coalition . the possible inclusion of he two religious parties shas and united torah judaism could make the coalition difficult as the two will likely want to ensure religious jews maintain the benefits and privileges so despised by meretz and unpopular with labor . however , robert rosenberg of haaretz newspaper told afp news sources that olmert " can rapidly form a relatively stable coalition , with the core comprised of kadima , labor and the pensioners , with meretz , united torah judaism and possibly shas on board .

although it won the most seats of any party , the outcome was far less than what opinion polls had forecast ahead of the ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert visits the west bank olmert , who shot to power only 12 weeks ago when prime minister ariel sharon suffered a massive stroke , campaigned on a plan to dismantle dozens of settlements and remove tens of thousands of jews from the west bank .
even though a majority of the members of parliament -lrb- mp -rrb- favors some kind of pullout from the west bank , which has been occupied by israel for nearly 40 years , olmert will be hard pressed to find a suitable coalition partner to achieve his ambitious goal of separating from the palestinians and establishing the final borders of the jewish state . possible partners the center-left labor party , predicted to emerge as the second force in parliament , garnered 20 seats .
it now looks forward to extracting social and economic concessions in exchange for joining the government with kadima .

olmert will also most likely have to bring in the parliament 's two ultra-orthodox factions to secure enough seats in his coalition . the possible inclusion of he two religious parties shas and united torah judaism could make the coalition difficult as the two will likely want to ensure religious jews maintain the benefits and privileges so despised by meretz and unpopular with labor . however , robert rosenberg of haaretz newspaper told afp news sources that olmert " can rapidly form a relatively stable coalition , with the core comprised of kadima , labor and the pensioners , with meretz , united torah judaism and possibly shas on board . " redrawing israel 's borders what has become clear in the hours following the election is that the nationalist right that has dominated power since 1977 will be frozen out of the next government after likud , the traditional champion of the right , suffered a crushing defeat .

" mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .
reding hopes the european commission will adopt the proposal in june , following further consultation . jane conway -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's telefonica launches takeover bid for o2 spanish telecoms giant telefonica launched a friendly cash bid of 26.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- for british group 02 that also operates in germany , according to a joint statement released on monday .

" mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .

" mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .
reding hopes the european commission will adopt the proposal in june , following further consultation . jane conway -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's telefonica launches takeover bid for o2 spanish telecoms giant telefonica launched a friendly cash bid of 26.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- for british group 02 that also operates in germany , according to a joint statement released on monday .

soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .
there is a large majority for these ideas between the center and left parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's action after the election could differ from his campaign ehud olmert made an announcement to the palestinians on the evening of the elections .
how will the new israeli government act toward the hamas administration ? during the campaigns the top candidates from all the parties said , " we will never speak with the hamas movement or a hamas government . "
that means we will have absolutely no negotiations with the palestinians since they would be conducted by a hamas government .
if anything we could only have one-sided developments . that was necessitated by the election .
as soon as the election was over , even the designated president ehud olmert said , " yes , we want to negotiate with the palestinians . "
he did not mention hamas specifically but who else would he negotiate with , if not the democratically elected palestinian government ?
he wants to negotiate with the palestinians and the labor party will force him to in any case .
and he said that only when the talks fail would we consider unilateral action such as pulling out of the occupied territories .
so things look optimistic . what time frame do you see these negotiations having before ehud olmert says he 's unilaterally pulling out ? there will not be direct negotiations right away because no one wants to lie to themselves . the israelis in terms of the hamas movement and the hamas movement in terms of their ideology not to recognize israel and to destroy israel .
it is going to become bit more complicated .
we would expect mediatory help behind the scenes from the egyptians dealing with the practical and pragmatic issues that have to do with daily life - especially improvements to the palestinians ' living conditions in the occupied territories . that will gradually develop into a peace process .
i do not know how long it will take , but i can say that it is in the interest of both sides .
the hamas movement needs israel to satisfy the palestinians who want improved living conditions right away .
and israel needs peace .
that is what the hamas movement can provide .
in august 2004 it put a ceasefire into effect and respected it .
attacks in israel today are conducted by other groups , not the hamas movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incoming hamas palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh needs to stick to the ceasefire i think pragmatic contact to solve daily problems will begin right away - as soon as the coalition is formed .
the egyptians will make sure it happens .
no on can predict hzow quickly that develops into a peace process . what can the new hamas government do now ? for israel there is one criteria and that is peace .
if hamas does not only keep to and respect its ceasefire but also as a government keeps other extremist groups in check , not to say to combat them , then that would be a sign to the israeli government . how do you interpret the ultra-nationalists ' good results ? the right has not disappeared .
the people who are right extremists or right nationalists or religious rightists still exist .
they are a little weaker and fewer in number , but they have not disappeared .
only the division of votes is a little different .

müntefering is holding off on a labor reform as french police battled students protesting against flexible hire and fire laws , germany 's social democrat labor minister stunned coalition partners by stopping a similar measure agreed upon in germany . one of the grand coalition 's first labor market reforms - and the one most difficult for social democrats to swallow - was the decision to allow companies to hire and fire employees during their first two years of employment . among those agreeing to the reform was new labor minister , and former head of the spd party , franz müntefering .
but in an article in wednesday 's handelsblatt newspaper , müntefering announced that he was stopping the reform , accusing the conservative parties of wanting too much . " i stopped it after parts of the union parties began taking steps away from this point in the coalition agreement , " he wrote . unions invoke french protests conservative economics minister michael glos said earlier in the week that the dismantling of germany 's strict job protection laws does n't go far enough , echoing similar complaints in parts of the christian democratic union , and christian social union parties .

michael sommer , the head of the dgb union association , said that the same things french students are yelling into their microphones during the last two weeks of protest could be said in germany . " what is being fought against in france , is being planned here , " said sommer , in a newspaper interview . sommer and union representatives argue that the two year probation period puts workers in an uncertain situation and makes it difficult for them to get a bank loan or an apartment contract .
he has called for the governing coalition to further consider the job-protection laws reached in the coalition agreement . merkel , union urge patience sommer 's concerns received some support from current spd head hubertus heil .
" we do n't want a hire and fire society , " heil said earlier this week , responding to glos 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to end speculation conservative politicians were surprised at müntefering 's announcement .
the economics expert in the cdu parliamentary faction said that the issue was still up for discussion .
chancellor angela merkel appeared a bit exasperated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.03.2006 eu deliberates capping roaming charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using a mobile while on vacation could become a lot cheaper in a potential blow to mobile phone operators , the european commission has begun considering a proposal that could see roaming charges on mobile phones in the eu reduced . the eu 's commissioner in charge of communication , viviane reding , unveiled an outline for cutting the cost of using mobile phones abroad on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding reding said the new eu regulation would " ensure that operators do not charge operators from other countries substantially more than the actual cost . " mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .
reding hopes the european commission will adopt the proposal in june , following further consultation . jane conway -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's telefonica launches takeover bid for o2 spanish telecoms giant telefonica launched a friendly cash bid of 26.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- for british group 02 that also operates in germany , according to a joint statement released on monday .

soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .
there is a large majority for these ideas between the center and left parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's action after the election could differ from his campaign ehud olmert made an announcement to the palestinians on the evening of the elections .
how will the new israeli government act toward the hamas administration ? during the campaigns the top candidates from all the parties said , " we will never speak with the hamas movement or a hamas government . "
that means we will have absolutely no negotiations with the palestinians since they would be conducted by a hamas government .
if anything we could only have one-sided developments . that was necessitated by the election .
as soon as the election was over , even the designated president ehud olmert said , " yes , we want to negotiate with the palestinians . "
he did not mention hamas specifically but who else would he negotiate with , if not the democratically elected palestinian government ?
he wants to negotiate with the palestinians and the labor party will force him to in any case .
and he said that only when the talks fail would we consider unilateral action such as pulling out of the occupied territories .
so things look optimistic . what time frame do you see these negotiations having before ehud olmert says he 's unilaterally pulling out ? there will not be direct negotiations right away because no one wants to lie to themselves . the israelis in terms of the hamas movement and the hamas movement in terms of their ideology not to recognize israel and to destroy israel .
it is going to become bit more complicated .
we would expect mediatory help behind the scenes from the egyptians dealing with the practical and pragmatic issues that have to do with daily life - especially improvements to the palestinians ' living conditions in the occupied territories . that will gradually develop into a peace process .
i do not know how long it will take , but i can say that it is in the interest of both sides .
the hamas movement needs israel to satisfy the palestinians who want improved living conditions right away .
and israel needs peace .
that is what the hamas movement can provide .
in august 2004 it put a ceasefire into effect and respected it .
attacks in israel today are conducted by other groups , not the hamas movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incoming hamas palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh needs to stick to the ceasefire i think pragmatic contact to solve daily problems will begin right away - as soon as the coalition is formed .
the egyptians will make sure it happens .
no on can predict hzow quickly that develops into a peace process . what can the new hamas government do now ? for israel there is one criteria and that is peace .
if hamas does not only keep to and respect its ceasefire but also as a government keeps other extremist groups in check , not to say to combat them , then that would be a sign to the israeli government . how do you interpret the ultra-nationalists ' good results ? the right has not disappeared .
the people who are right extremists or right nationalists or religious rightists still exist .
they are a little weaker and fewer in number , but they have not disappeared .
only the division of votes is a little different .

big mistake . after " moni "'s friend was fired after her new job 's trial period - not an uncommon occurrence in a country with over five million unemployed - she , like the thousands germany 's bloggers who share their personal details with anyone willing to read them , took a few minutes to put the particulars on her blog , gedankenträger . that 's when the transparency international germany set the lawyers loose . the group that dedicates itself to opening all government and business books for anyone to have a look demanded no one cast as much as quick gaze at the blog post describing the way moni 's friend was fired and threatened legal action if the single , unemployed mother did n't remove the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bloggers caused a headache for the transparency international pr machine no open arms waiting for moni " i assume you are aware of the legal as well as the financial consequences that would result for you , " the letter stated . moni posted the letter , too . though she deleted the lawyer 's name and the organization that sent it , the ti lawyers were not to be stopped and a second letter threatening legal action if the entry was n't removed landed on moni 's doorstep , claiming the second entry broke copyright laws . " to be honest i had actually expected that they would welcome a critical comment , " moni told netzeitung.de.
" after all , transparency international , as anyone can read on their web site , explicitly approves whistle blowing . " bloggers take to the case the lawyers might have been well-instructed to have left the long-ago archived post that had all but entered the internet ether alone .
it ended up being the organization 's response that convinced dozens of german bloggers to expose a double standard in a group set on to bring light to the dark corners of bureaucracy .
they reprinted the letter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing a trip before the judge , moni removed the posts apparently ti did n't enjoying being the most searched-for term at technorati.com , a blog search engine , and has since decided against pressing legal charges against moni , ti germany 's general manger dagmar schröder told tagesschau.de . " we simply asked our lawyer to get involved in the case , " she said .
" it 's definitely possible to debate if the extent of the action was appropriate . " when asked what ti 's next steps would be , jochen bäumel , a ti board member , replied " nothing . " " it does n't matter what we do , it will be wrong , " he added .

müntefering is holding off on a labor reform as french police battled students protesting against flexible hire and fire laws , germany 's social democrat labor minister stunned coalition partners by stopping a similar measure agreed upon in germany . one of the grand coalition 's first labor market reforms - and the one most difficult for social democrats to swallow - was the decision to allow companies to hire and fire employees during their first two years of employment . among those agreeing to the reform was new labor minister , and former head of the spd party , franz müntefering .
but in an article in wednesday 's handelsblatt newspaper , müntefering announced that he was stopping the reform , accusing the conservative parties of wanting too much . " i stopped it after parts of the union parties began taking steps away from this point in the coalition agreement , " he wrote . unions invoke french protests conservative economics minister michael glos said earlier in the week that the dismantling of germany 's strict job protection laws does n't go far enough , echoing similar complaints in parts of the christian democratic union , and christian social union parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions against loosening job protection laws the prospect has inflamed union representatives .
michael sommer , the head of the dgb union association , said that the same things french students are yelling into their microphones during the last two weeks of protest could be said in germany . " what is being fought against in france , is being planned here , " said sommer , in a newspaper interview . sommer and union representatives argue that the two year probation period puts workers in an uncertain situation and makes it difficult for them to get a bank loan or an apartment contract .
he has called for the governing coalition to further consider the job-protection laws reached in the coalition agreement . merkel , union urge patience sommer 's concerns received some support from current spd head hubertus heil .
" we do n't want a hire and fire society , " heil said earlier this week , responding to glos 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to end speculation conservative politicians were surprised at müntefering 's announcement .
the economics expert in the cdu parliamentary faction said that the issue was still up for discussion .

although it won the most seats of any party , the outcome was far less than what opinion polls had forecast ahead of the ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert visits the west bank olmert , who shot to power only 12 weeks ago when prime minister ariel sharon suffered a massive stroke , campaigned on a plan to dismantle dozens of settlements and remove tens of thousands of jews from the west bank .
even though a majority of the members of parliament -lrb- mp -rrb- favors some kind of pullout from the west bank , which has been occupied by israel for nearly 40 years , olmert will be hard pressed to find a suitable coalition partner to achieve his ambitious goal of separating from the palestinians and establishing the final borders of the jewish state . possible partners the center-left labor party , predicted to emerge as the second force in parliament , garnered 20 seats .
it now looks forward to extracting social and economic concessions in exchange for joining the government with kadima .
led by amir peretzs , the party has also made clear it would prefer a negotiated solution with the palestinians to unilateral steps as favored by kadima . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor party leader amir peretz between them kadima and labor lack enough seats to form a majority on their own and will have to look for partners among some of the smaller factions , including the fledgling pensioners ' list and the left-wing , secular meretz party .
olmert will also most likely have to bring in the parliament 's two ultra-orthodox factions to secure enough seats in his coalition . the possible inclusion of he two religious parties shas and united torah judaism could make the coalition difficult as the two will likely want to ensure religious jews maintain the benefits and privileges so despised by meretz and unpopular with labor . however , robert rosenberg of haaretz newspaper told afp news sources that olmert " can rapidly form a relatively stable coalition , with the core comprised of kadima , labor and the pensioners , with meretz , united torah judaism and possibly shas on board . " redrawing israel 's borders what has become clear in the hours following the election is that the nationalist right that has dominated power since 1977 will be frozen out of the next government after likud , the traditional champion of the right , suffered a crushing defeat . " the strength of kadima has managed to destroy the right wing .
these elections are seen first and foremost as a referendum on the partitioning of land , " said political commentator ari shavit on israel 's channel one television . bildunterschrift : the removal of settlements is a major goal of kadima when all possible cooperating parties are taken together , those supporting a withdrawal from the west bank and a permanent definition of israel 's borders outweigh the opponents from the far-right .
" this plan has close to 80 seats .
two thirds of the people !
that 's the most dramatic thing that happened , " boasted incoming kadima mp haim ramon after televisions published their exit polls . " the left is now two-thirds of the knesset .
if olmert has the courage , he can dismantle the settlements and make peace and retreat , as he wants .
he has tremendous power in the knesset , " said arab israeli mp abdel malek dehamsheh . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exit polls : kadima wins narrow victory in israel election the ruling kadima party was on course to narrowly beat its rivals in israel 's election on tuesday , a crucial vote seen as a referendum on plans to finalize the borders of the jewish state .

although it won the most seats of any party , the outcome was far less than what opinion polls had forecast ahead of the ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert visits the west bank olmert , who shot to power only 12 weeks ago when prime minister ariel sharon suffered a massive stroke , campaigned on a plan to dismantle dozens of settlements and remove tens of thousands of jews from the west bank .
even though a majority of the members of parliament -lrb- mp -rrb- favors some kind of pullout from the west bank , which has been occupied by israel for nearly 40 years , olmert will be hard pressed to find a suitable coalition partner to achieve his ambitious goal of separating from the palestinians and establishing the final borders of the jewish state . possible partners the center-left labor party , predicted to emerge as the second force in parliament , garnered 20 seats .
it now looks forward to extracting social and economic concessions in exchange for joining the government with kadima .
led by amir peretzs , the party has also made clear it would prefer a negotiated solution with the palestinians to unilateral steps as favored by kadima . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor party leader amir peretz between them kadima and labor lack enough seats to form a majority on their own and will have to look for partners among some of the smaller factions , including the fledgling pensioners ' list and the left-wing , secular meretz party .
olmert will also most likely have to bring in the parliament 's two ultra-orthodox factions to secure enough seats in his coalition . the possible inclusion of he two religious parties shas and united torah judaism could make the coalition difficult as the two will likely want to ensure religious jews maintain the benefits and privileges so despised by meretz and unpopular with labor . however , robert rosenberg of haaretz newspaper told afp news sources that olmert " can rapidly form a relatively stable coalition , with the core comprised of kadima , labor and the pensioners , with meretz , united torah judaism and possibly shas on board . " redrawing israel 's borders what has become clear in the hours following the election is that the nationalist right that has dominated power since 1977 will be frozen out of the next government after likud , the traditional champion of the right , suffered a crushing defeat . " the strength of kadima has managed to destroy the right wing .
these elections are seen first and foremost as a referendum on the partitioning of land , " said political commentator ari shavit on israel 's channel one television . bildunterschrift : the removal of settlements is a major goal of kadima when all possible cooperating parties are taken together , those supporting a withdrawal from the west bank and a permanent definition of israel 's borders outweigh the opponents from the far-right .
" this plan has close to 80 seats .
two thirds of the people !
that 's the most dramatic thing that happened , " boasted incoming kadima mp haim ramon after televisions published their exit polls . " the left is now two-thirds of the knesset .
if olmert has the courage , he can dismantle the settlements and make peace and retreat , as he wants .
he has tremendous power in the knesset , " said arab israeli mp abdel malek dehamsheh . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exit polls : kadima wins narrow victory in israel election the ruling kadima party was on course to narrowly beat its rivals in israel 's election on tuesday , a crucial vote seen as a referendum on plans to finalize the borders of the jewish state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.03.2006 eu deliberates capping roaming charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using a mobile while on vacation could become a lot cheaper in a potential blow to mobile phone operators , the european commission has begun considering a proposal that could see roaming charges on mobile phones in the eu reduced . the eu 's commissioner in charge of communication , viviane reding , unveiled an outline for cutting the cost of using mobile phones abroad on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding reding said the new eu regulation would " ensure that operators do not charge operators from other countries substantially more than the actual cost . " mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .
reding hopes the european commission will adopt the proposal in june , following further consultation . jane conway -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's telefonica launches takeover bid for o2 spanish telecoms giant telefonica launched a friendly cash bid of 26.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- for british group 02 that also operates in germany , according to a joint statement released on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.03.2006 when transparency international gets cloudy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international does n't want others to have the key to its information unhappy when a recently-fired employee 's complaints ended up on a blog , transparency international hired lawyers to force the postings off the internet .
big mistake . after " moni "'s friend was fired after her new job 's trial period - not an uncommon occurrence in a country with over five million unemployed - she , like the thousands germany 's bloggers who share their personal details with anyone willing to read them , took a few minutes to put the particulars on her blog , gedankenträger . that 's when the transparency international germany set the lawyers loose . the group that dedicates itself to opening all government and business books for anyone to have a look demanded no one cast as much as quick gaze at the blog post describing the way moni 's friend was fired and threatened legal action if the single , unemployed mother did n't remove the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bloggers caused a headache for the transparency international pr machine no open arms waiting for moni " i assume you are aware of the legal as well as the financial consequences that would result for you , " the letter stated . moni posted the letter , too . though she deleted the lawyer 's name and the organization that sent it , the ti lawyers were not to be stopped and a second letter threatening legal action if the entry was n't removed landed on moni 's doorstep , claiming the second entry broke copyright laws . " to be honest i had actually expected that they would welcome a critical comment , " moni told netzeitung.de.
" after all , transparency international , as anyone can read on their web site , explicitly approves whistle blowing . " bloggers take to the case the lawyers might have been well-instructed to have left the long-ago archived post that had all but entered the internet ether alone .
it ended up being the organization 's response that convinced dozens of german bloggers to expose a double standard in a group set on to bring light to the dark corners of bureaucracy .
they reprinted the letter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing a trip before the judge , moni removed the posts apparently ti did n't enjoying being the most searched-for term at technorati.com , a blog search engine , and has since decided against pressing legal charges against moni , ti germany 's general manger dagmar schröder told tagesschau.de . " we simply asked our lawyer to get involved in the case , " she said .
" it 's definitely possible to debate if the extent of the action was appropriate . " when asked what ti 's next steps would be , jochen bäumel , a ti board member , replied " nothing . " " it does n't matter what we do , it will be wrong , " he added .

" mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .
reding hopes the european commission will adopt the proposal in june , following further consultation . jane conway -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's telefonica launches takeover bid for o2 spanish telecoms giant telefonica launched a friendly cash bid of 26.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- for british group 02 that also operates in germany , according to a joint statement released on monday .

so far eu aid could only be used to help farmers who have had an outbreak of avian influenza on their own property , or who can not send the produce to market because of veterinary restrictions . " this unprecedented situation can no longer be dealt with using the existing tools , " said agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said .
" that is why we want to extend the scope of the existing regulations to allow eu co-financing of special market measures . " under the proposal , the commission would pick up half the cost of measures to help the market , hit by a drop in consumer confidence as the bird flu outbreaks spread across the eu . in effect by april ? if member states and the european parliament give the green light to the proposal , it could go into effect by the end of april .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.03.2006 eu deliberates capping roaming charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using a mobile while on vacation could become a lot cheaper in a potential blow to mobile phone operators , the european commission has begun considering a proposal that could see roaming charges on mobile phones in the eu reduced . the eu 's commissioner in charge of communication , viviane reding , unveiled an outline for cutting the cost of using mobile phones abroad on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding reding said the new eu regulation would " ensure that operators do not charge operators from other countries substantially more than the actual cost . " mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .
reding hopes the european commission will adopt the proposal in june , following further consultation . jane conway -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's telefonica launches takeover bid for o2 spanish telecoms giant telefonica launched a friendly cash bid of 26.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- for british group 02 that also operates in germany , according to a joint statement released on monday .

one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ? up until now , germany 's grand coalition of social democrats and conservative cdu / csu parties has been slow to tackle major reforms . chancellor angela merkel has instead reveled in her winning appearances on the international stage .
political aides waited patiently for last sunday 's three major state elections to pass . this wednesday evening , the waiting will be over .
merkel will meet with the coalition 's political elite to reach agreement on one of the country 's most pressing and complicated reform projects : the health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel , still eye to eye ?

he also ruled out the conservatives ' solidarity-based system . going for some " basic understanding " but the spd has shown itself open to the conservative plan to finance childrens ' health insurance through taxes .
whether there is any money in state coffers for that sort of solidarity is anybody 's guess . the divide between the two major parties continues to be wide - but merkel and her coalition counterparts , labor minister franz müntefering and platzeck , have already shown they are willing to compromise : they were able to form the government coalition in the first place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.03.2006 when transparency international gets cloudy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international does n't want others to have the key to its information unhappy when a recently-fired employee 's complaints ended up on a blog , transparency international hired lawyers to force the postings off the internet .
big mistake . after " moni "'s friend was fired after her new job 's trial period - not an uncommon occurrence in a country with over five million unemployed - she , like the thousands germany 's bloggers who share their personal details with anyone willing to read them , took a few minutes to put the particulars on her blog , gedankenträger . that 's when the transparency international germany set the lawyers loose . the group that dedicates itself to opening all government and business books for anyone to have a look demanded no one cast as much as quick gaze at the blog post describing the way moni 's friend was fired and threatened legal action if the single , unemployed mother did n't remove the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bloggers caused a headache for the transparency international pr machine no open arms waiting for moni " i assume you are aware of the legal as well as the financial consequences that would result for you , " the letter stated . moni posted the letter , too . though she deleted the lawyer 's name and the organization that sent it , the ti lawyers were not to be stopped and a second letter threatening legal action if the entry was n't removed landed on moni 's doorstep , claiming the second entry broke copyright laws . " to be honest i had actually expected that they would welcome a critical comment , " moni told netzeitung.de.
" after all , transparency international , as anyone can read on their web site , explicitly approves whistle blowing . " bloggers take to the case the lawyers might have been well-instructed to have left the long-ago archived post that had all but entered the internet ether alone .
it ended up being the organization 's response that convinced dozens of german bloggers to expose a double standard in a group set on to bring light to the dark corners of bureaucracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.03.2006 eu deliberates capping roaming charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using a mobile while on vacation could become a lot cheaper in a potential blow to mobile phone operators , the european commission has begun considering a proposal that could see roaming charges on mobile phones in the eu reduced . the eu 's commissioner in charge of communication , viviane reding , unveiled an outline for cutting the cost of using mobile phones abroad on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding reding said the new eu regulation would " ensure that operators do not charge operators from other countries substantially more than the actual cost . " mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .
reding hopes the european commission will adopt the proposal in june , following further consultation . jane conway -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's telefonica launches takeover bid for o2 spanish telecoms giant telefonica launched a friendly cash bid of 26.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- for british group 02 that also operates in germany , according to a joint statement released on monday .

soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .
there is a large majority for these ideas between the center and left parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's action after the election could differ from his campaign ehud olmert made an announcement to the palestinians on the evening of the elections .
how will the new israeli government act toward the hamas administration ? during the campaigns the top candidates from all the parties said , " we will never speak with the hamas movement or a hamas government . "
that means we will have absolutely no negotiations with the palestinians since they would be conducted by a hamas government .
if anything we could only have one-sided developments . that was necessitated by the election .
as soon as the election was over , even the designated president ehud olmert said , " yes , we want to negotiate with the palestinians . "
he did not mention hamas specifically but who else would he negotiate with , if not the democratically elected palestinian government ?
he wants to negotiate with the palestinians and the labor party will force him to in any case .
and he said that only when the talks fail would we consider unilateral action such as pulling out of the occupied territories .
so things look optimistic . what time frame do you see these negotiations having before ehud olmert says he 's unilaterally pulling out ? there will not be direct negotiations right away because no one wants to lie to themselves . the israelis in terms of the hamas movement and the hamas movement in terms of their ideology not to recognize israel and to destroy israel .
it is going to become bit more complicated .
we would expect mediatory help behind the scenes from the egyptians dealing with the practical and pragmatic issues that have to do with daily life - especially improvements to the palestinians ' living conditions in the occupied territories . that will gradually develop into a peace process .
i do not know how long it will take , but i can say that it is in the interest of both sides .
the hamas movement needs israel to satisfy the palestinians who want improved living conditions right away .
and israel needs peace .
that is what the hamas movement can provide .
in august 2004 it put a ceasefire into effect and respected it .
attacks in israel today are conducted by other groups , not the hamas movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incoming hamas palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh needs to stick to the ceasefire i think pragmatic contact to solve daily problems will begin right away - as soon as the coalition is formed .
the egyptians will make sure it happens .
no on can predict hzow quickly that develops into a peace process . what can the new hamas government do now ? for israel there is one criteria and that is peace .
if hamas does not only keep to and respect its ceasefire but also as a government keeps other extremist groups in check , not to say to combat them , then that would be a sign to the israeli government . how do you interpret the ultra-nationalists ' good results ? the right has not disappeared .
the people who are right extremists or right nationalists or religious rightists still exist .
they are a little weaker and fewer in number , but they have not disappeared .
only the division of votes is a little different .

müntefering is holding off on a labor reform as french police battled students protesting against flexible hire and fire laws , germany 's social democrat labor minister stunned coalition partners by stopping a similar measure agreed upon in germany . one of the grand coalition 's first labor market reforms - and the one most difficult for social democrats to swallow - was the decision to allow companies to hire and fire employees during their first two years of employment . among those agreeing to the reform was new labor minister , and former head of the spd party , franz müntefering .
but in an article in wednesday 's handelsblatt newspaper , müntefering announced that he was stopping the reform , accusing the conservative parties of wanting too much . " i stopped it after parts of the union parties began taking steps away from this point in the coalition agreement , " he wrote . unions invoke french protests conservative economics minister michael glos said earlier in the week that the dismantling of germany 's strict job protection laws does n't go far enough , echoing similar complaints in parts of the christian democratic union , and christian social union parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions against loosening job protection laws the prospect has inflamed union representatives .
michael sommer , the head of the dgb union association , said that the same things french students are yelling into their microphones during the last two weeks of protest could be said in germany . " what is being fought against in france , is being planned here , " said sommer , in a newspaper interview . sommer and union representatives argue that the two year probation period puts workers in an uncertain situation and makes it difficult for them to get a bank loan or an apartment contract .
he has called for the governing coalition to further consider the job-protection laws reached in the coalition agreement . merkel , union urge patience sommer 's concerns received some support from current spd head hubertus heil .
" we do n't want a hire and fire society , " heil said earlier this week , responding to glos 's comments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to end speculation conservative politicians were surprised at müntefering 's announcement .

so far eu aid could only be used to help farmers who have had an outbreak of avian influenza on their own property , or who can not send the produce to market because of veterinary restrictions . " this unprecedented situation can no longer be dealt with using the existing tools , " said agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said .
" that is why we want to extend the scope of the existing regulations to allow eu co-financing of special market measures . " under the proposal , the commission would pick up half the cost of measures to help the market , hit by a drop in consumer confidence as the bird flu outbreaks spread across the eu . in effect by april ? if member states and the european parliament give the green light to the proposal , it could go into effect by the end of april .
then member states would have to submit proposals on aid to support the market to the commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry sales have fallen since bird flu was detected in eu countries " in my view , the most sensible approach would be to compensate farmers for measures which temporarily reduce production , " said fischer boel .
" i hope that the european parliament and ... agriculture ministers will adopt this measure quickly , to allow the aid to flow as soon as possible , " she added . commission spokesman for agriculture michael mann said that there " is some slack " in his department 's budget that could be tapped into but declined to say how much money would be needed since that depended on how much member states asked for . france and italy have been leading efforts to convince brussels to take action to calm the crisis .
following a string of first outbreaks in the eu , italy reported a 70 percent drop in poultry sales and france saw sales fall 15 percent . mann said that the commission had no centralized information about poultry sales and was relying on what member states reported . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .

this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . despite the criticism , christian socialist union politician peter ramsauer said he was optimistic that the coalition could find a compromise , at least when it came to health care reform . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

merkel will meet with the coalition 's political elite to reach agreement on one of the country 's most pressing and complicated reform projects : the health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel , still eye to eye ?
next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . social democrats , conservatives far apart the differences between the two sides remain wide . the social democrats have favored a system which abolishes the division between public and private health care .
critics say patients with private insurance receive preferential treatment .
their " citizen 's insurance " would mean that every insurance company would be required to insure every citizen regardless of risk , but would also eliminate tax loopholes for big-earners and freelancers .
the fees would depend on income .
the higher a person 's salary , the higher the rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias platzeck has laid down some rules the conservatives are absolutely against the idea .
they want a solidarity-based system that would require every adult to pay the same insurance fee regardless of income . rather than abolish the public-private divide in health insurance , the conservatives would seek to increase competition between the two . spd leader matthias platzeck , who will be taking part in the meetings wednesday night , has already marked out a few " do-not-cross " lines , including no drastic cutbacks in services and leaving open the possibility of increasing the employer 's share of the monthly premium .
he also ruled out the conservatives ' solidarity-based system . going for some " basic understanding " but the spd has shown itself open to the conservative plan to finance childrens ' health insurance through taxes .
whether there is any money in state coffers for that sort of solidarity is anybody 's guess . the divide between the two major parties continues to be wide - but merkel and her coalition counterparts , labor minister franz müntefering and platzeck , have already shown they are willing to compromise : they were able to form the government coalition in the first place .
but what about merkel 's goals in the talks ?
she wants the parties to reach some sort of " basic understanding . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de health care in germany - a matter of class ?

soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .
there is a large majority for these ideas between the center and left parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's action after the election could differ from his campaign ehud olmert made an announcement to the palestinians on the evening of the elections .
how will the new israeli government act toward the hamas administration ? during the campaigns the top candidates from all the parties said , " we will never speak with the hamas movement or a hamas government . "
that means we will have absolutely no negotiations with the palestinians since they would be conducted by a hamas government .
if anything we could only have one-sided developments . that was necessitated by the election .
as soon as the election was over , even the designated president ehud olmert said , " yes , we want to negotiate with the palestinians . "

he wants to negotiate with the palestinians and the labor party will force him to in any case .
and he said that only when the talks fail would we consider unilateral action such as pulling out of the occupied territories .

i do not know how long it will take , but i can say that it is in the interest of both sides .
the hamas movement needs israel to satisfy the palestinians who want improved living conditions right away .

soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.03.2006 eu deliberates capping roaming charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using a mobile while on vacation could become a lot cheaper in a potential blow to mobile phone operators , the european commission has begun considering a proposal that could see roaming charges on mobile phones in the eu reduced . the eu 's commissioner in charge of communication , viviane reding , unveiled an outline for cutting the cost of using mobile phones abroad on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding reding said the new eu regulation would " ensure that operators do not charge operators from other countries substantially more than the actual cost . " mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .
reding hopes the european commission will adopt the proposal in june , following further consultation . jane conway -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's telefonica launches takeover bid for o2 spanish telecoms giant telefonica launched a friendly cash bid of 26.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- for british group 02 that also operates in germany , according to a joint statement released on monday .

" mobile operators worried but mobile phone operators say the eu regulation outline does not take into account market variations across europe .
philipp schindera , a spokesperson for t-mobile international , criticized the lack of detail in the eu proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : southern european beaches are attracting many more people than nothern european countries " it does n't take into account that you have an unbalanced situation in europe , " schindera said .
" there are many more people who travel from northern to southern europe than the other way around , and this means for example , that t-mobile pays more to operators in the south than it gets back from them , because generally people in the south do n't go north for their vacations . " the proposal includes suggestions that could see calls made from a mobile abroad being charged at the same rates as if they were made at home .
so , for example , a german who travels to britain with his mobile phone will pay the same to call people within britain as he would if he were using his mobile in germany , calling people within the german states . telecom groups , however , say existing competition and regulatory tools are adequate . " we think we have strong competition among all mobile operators , so we do n't see a need for regulation from the eu , " schindera said .
" we have said in the past that the market can handle the issue itself , and you can see that the rates have already come down . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobile phone operators suffer if they have to forego roaming charges ?
mobile phone operators have argued that cutting roaming costs would severely impact their profits .
currently , operators rely on roaming charges for between 8 and 15 percent of their revenue . they argue that the normal reason for regulating a market is if it is failing in some way , which is not the case here . not reflecting competition the eu says mobile operators have had long enough to reduce costs , and have done disappointingly little so far .
at an eu summit on friday , eu leaders agreed that cuts in roaming charges would boost competitiveness in the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's looking for more competition on the cell phone market in 2004 , brussels began launching probes into roaming charges .
shortly afterwards , it formally charged t-mobile and vodafone for overcharging customers in germany . in october 2005 , reding launched an eu website , drawing consumers ' attention to charges travellers can expect to incur when they use mobiles abroad .
however , despite operator claims that prices have gone down since 2005 , the european commission is still not satisfied that prices reflect competition in the mobile market . the european member states and parliament will have to give approval before any new regulations are put into place .

soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .
there is a large majority for these ideas between the center and left parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's action after the election could differ from his campaign ehud olmert made an announcement to the palestinians on the evening of the elections .
how will the new israeli government act toward the hamas administration ? during the campaigns the top candidates from all the parties said , " we will never speak with the hamas movement or a hamas government . "
that means we will have absolutely no negotiations with the palestinians since they would be conducted by a hamas government .
if anything we could only have one-sided developments . that was necessitated by the election .
as soon as the election was over , even the designated president ehud olmert said , " yes , we want to negotiate with the palestinians . "
he did not mention hamas specifically but who else would he negotiate with , if not the democratically elected palestinian government ?
he wants to negotiate with the palestinians and the labor party will force him to in any case .
and he said that only when the talks fail would we consider unilateral action such as pulling out of the occupied territories .
so things look optimistic . what time frame do you see these negotiations having before ehud olmert says he 's unilaterally pulling out ? there will not be direct negotiations right away because no one wants to lie to themselves . the israelis in terms of the hamas movement and the hamas movement in terms of their ideology not to recognize israel and to destroy israel .
it is going to become bit more complicated .
we would expect mediatory help behind the scenes from the egyptians dealing with the practical and pragmatic issues that have to do with daily life - especially improvements to the palestinians ' living conditions in the occupied territories . that will gradually develop into a peace process .
i do not know how long it will take , but i can say that it is in the interest of both sides .
the hamas movement needs israel to satisfy the palestinians who want improved living conditions right away .
and israel needs peace .
that is what the hamas movement can provide .
in august 2004 it put a ceasefire into effect and respected it .
attacks in israel today are conducted by other groups , not the hamas movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incoming hamas palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh needs to stick to the ceasefire i think pragmatic contact to solve daily problems will begin right away - as soon as the coalition is formed .
the egyptians will make sure it happens .
no on can predict hzow quickly that develops into a peace process . what can the new hamas government do now ? for israel there is one criteria and that is peace .
if hamas does not only keep to and respect its ceasefire but also as a government keeps other extremist groups in check , not to say to combat them , then that would be a sign to the israeli government . how do you interpret the ultra-nationalists ' good results ? the right has not disappeared .
the people who are right extremists or right nationalists or religious rightists still exist .
they are a little weaker and fewer in number , but they have not disappeared .
only the division of votes is a little different .
a different extreme right party profited when the likud party lost so much .
this is a different separation inside of the right . klaudia prevezanos interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de olmert claims israel victory , looks for partners despite capturing the most votes in israel 's election , ehud olmert 's kadima party will have to turn to partners to form a wider coalition if it wants to push ahead with fixing israel 's final borders .

so far eu aid could only be used to help farmers who have had an outbreak of avian influenza on their own property , or who can not send the produce to market because of veterinary restrictions . " this unprecedented situation can no longer be dealt with using the existing tools , " said agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said .
" that is why we want to extend the scope of the existing regulations to allow eu co-financing of special market measures . " under the proposal , the commission would pick up half the cost of measures to help the market , hit by a drop in consumer confidence as the bird flu outbreaks spread across the eu . in effect by april ? if member states and the european parliament give the green light to the proposal , it could go into effect by the end of april .
then member states would have to submit proposals on aid to support the market to the commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry sales have fallen since bird flu was detected in eu countries " in my view , the most sensible approach would be to compensate farmers for measures which temporarily reduce production , " said fischer boel .
" i hope that the european parliament and ... agriculture ministers will adopt this measure quickly , to allow the aid to flow as soon as possible , " she added . commission spokesman for agriculture michael mann said that there " is some slack " in his department 's budget that could be tapped into but declined to say how much money would be needed since that depended on how much member states asked for . france and italy have been leading efforts to convince brussels to take action to calm the crisis .
following a string of first outbreaks in the eu , italy reported a 70 percent drop in poultry sales and france saw sales fall 15 percent . mann said that the commission had no centralized information about poultry sales and was relying on what member states reported . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .

but the opposition urged the government to attach the budget to an overall general change in its labor policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in the bundestag the budget , put forth by social democrat finance minister peer steinbrück , is a reform that allows for growth , merkel said . " we need to reduce our mountains of debt , but we ca n't do everything at once , " the chancellor told the bundestag . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free-market liberal fdp party , called for the new government to " move away from the social democrat concept .

" the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .
" next year we are planning to invest considerably more and notably drive our deficit below the eu 's 3 percent limit . " staggering national debt the fresh borrowing , however , will increase germany 's national debt to a staggering 900 billion euros .
this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . despite the criticism , christian socialist union politician peter ramsauer said he was optimistic that the coalition could find a compromise , at least when it came to health care reform . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.03.2006 primor : israeli talks with hamas could begin soon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small steps on daily issues will lead way to peace , according to primor congratulated by german chancellor angela merkel , ehud olmert is expected to put together a government quickly .
soon after he will begin talks with hamas , israel 's former ambassador to germany told dw-world.de. ari primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
he is currently the director of the center for european studies at the university of herzliya . dw-world.de : the kadima party did worse than expected before the election .
how difficult will that make building a government ? avi primor : building a government will not be as easy as predicted .
still , the right is weaker and , importantly , is divided , which makes it impossible for it to form part of a coalition , but it can still keep a center-left coalition from coming together .
that means we will have a coalition made from the kadima and labor parties , along with a few smaller parties .
i assume that a solid coalition with a majority in parliament will be formed in a short time . how do you explain that the kadima party won 10 seats fewer than expected ? the experts have always said that the kadima party would not do as well as the polls predicted .
in addition to that , the party 's candidate made a couple of tactical mistakes that cost him a few seats . but what we see is that a majority of the israeli population wants to be separate from the palestinians or have negotiations with the palestinians and , if possible , even peace .
at any rate it wants the end of occupation and vacating of settlements .
there is a large majority for these ideas between the center and left parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's action after the election could differ from his campaign ehud olmert made an announcement to the palestinians on the evening of the elections .
how will the new israeli government act toward the hamas administration ? during the campaigns the top candidates from all the parties said , " we will never speak with the hamas movement or a hamas government . "
that means we will have absolutely no negotiations with the palestinians since they would be conducted by a hamas government .
if anything we could only have one-sided developments . that was necessitated by the election .
as soon as the election was over , even the designated president ehud olmert said , " yes , we want to negotiate with the palestinians . "
he did not mention hamas specifically but who else would he negotiate with , if not the democratically elected palestinian government ?
he wants to negotiate with the palestinians and the labor party will force him to in any case .
and he said that only when the talks fail would we consider unilateral action such as pulling out of the occupied territories .
so things look optimistic . what time frame do you see these negotiations having before ehud olmert says he 's unilaterally pulling out ? there will not be direct negotiations right away because no one wants to lie to themselves . the israelis in terms of the hamas movement and the hamas movement in terms of their ideology not to recognize israel and to destroy israel .
it is going to become bit more complicated .
we would expect mediatory help behind the scenes from the egyptians dealing with the practical and pragmatic issues that have to do with daily life - especially improvements to the palestinians ' living conditions in the occupied territories . that will gradually develop into a peace process .
i do not know how long it will take , but i can say that it is in the interest of both sides .
the hamas movement needs israel to satisfy the palestinians who want improved living conditions right away .
and israel needs peace .
that is what the hamas movement can provide .
in august 2004 it put a ceasefire into effect and respected it .
attacks in israel today are conducted by other groups , not the hamas movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incoming hamas palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh needs to stick to the ceasefire i think pragmatic contact to solve daily problems will begin right away - as soon as the coalition is formed .
the egyptians will make sure it happens .
no on can predict hzow quickly that develops into a peace process . what can the new hamas government do now ? for israel there is one criteria and that is peace .
if hamas does not only keep to and respect its ceasefire but also as a government keeps other extremist groups in check , not to say to combat them , then that would be a sign to the israeli government . how do you interpret the ultra-nationalists ' good results ? the right has not disappeared .
the people who are right extremists or right nationalists or religious rightists still exist .
they are a little weaker and fewer in number , but they have not disappeared .
only the division of votes is a little different .
a different extreme right party profited when the likud party lost so much .
this is a different separation inside of the right . klaudia prevezanos interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de olmert claims israel victory , looks for partners despite capturing the most votes in israel 's election , ehud olmert 's kadima party will have to turn to partners to form a wider coalition if it wants to push ahead with fixing israel 's final borders .
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- exit polls : kadima wins narrow victory in israel election the ruling kadima party was on course to narrowly beat its rivals in israel 's election on tuesday , a crucial vote seen as a referendum on plans to finalize the borders of the jewish state .
-lrb- march 28 , 2006 -rrb- eu awaits results of israeli poll as members of the " quartet " of mediators in the middle east conflict , germany and the eu have a keen interest in the outcome of israel 's parliamentary elections .
but will they provide new impetus for the peace process ?

" in every country where there 's been a turnaround , be it finland , north ireland , or south korea , there is always a political concept behind it that wants to see the information technology area pushed forward , " he said . following the dot-com bubble burst , and a severe dearth of qualified employees that prompted german politicians to introduce a green card specifically for the it industry , the branch shows signs of recovery .
together with the overall improved economic climate , the munich-based ifo institute 's new economic index on tuesday mentioned an upswing in new jobs in the it sector .

the most advanced card of its kind in the world will link an estimated 80 million cards with two million completely different systems located in hospitals , doctor 's and insurance offices . " such … projects always have a positive effect on exports , " jarke said .

so far eu aid could only be used to help farmers who have had an outbreak of avian influenza on their own property , or who can not send the produce to market because of veterinary restrictions . " this unprecedented situation can no longer be dealt with using the existing tools , " said agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said .
" that is why we want to extend the scope of the existing regulations to allow eu co-financing of special market measures . " under the proposal , the commission would pick up half the cost of measures to help the market , hit by a drop in consumer confidence as the bird flu outbreaks spread across the eu . in effect by april ? if member states and the european parliament give the green light to the proposal , it could go into effect by the end of april .
then member states would have to submit proposals on aid to support the market to the commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry sales have fallen since bird flu was detected in eu countries " in my view , the most sensible approach would be to compensate farmers for measures which temporarily reduce production , " said fischer boel .
" i hope that the european parliament and ... agriculture ministers will adopt this measure quickly , to allow the aid to flow as soon as possible , " she added . commission spokesman for agriculture michael mann said that there " is some slack " in his department 's budget that could be tapped into but declined to say how much money would be needed since that depended on how much member states asked for . france and italy have been leading efforts to convince brussels to take action to calm the crisis .
following a string of first outbreaks in the eu , italy reported a 70 percent drop in poultry sales and france saw sales fall 15 percent . mann said that the commission had no centralized information about poultry sales and was relying on what member states reported . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .

but the opposition urged the government to attach the budget to an overall general change in its labor policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in the bundestag the budget , put forth by social democrat finance minister peer steinbrück , is a reform that allows for growth , merkel said . " we need to reduce our mountains of debt , but we ca n't do everything at once , " the chancellor told the bundestag . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free-market liberal fdp party , called for the new government to " move away from the social democrat concept . "
he added that the current coalition relies too much on the " old social democrat war chest of labor policies " that have led to the current figure of five million jobless in germany . as per the plan , the german government will again be living beyond its means in 2006:50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- in this year 's budget of 261 billion euros are not covered by state revenues . lots of borrowing that 's why the steinbrück plan relies heavily on fresh borrowing - totaling about 38 billion euros this year - and on selling off state property to meet the expense . in order to be able to do that he has declared a state of fiscal emergency that allows him to ignore a clause in the constitution stipulating that new government debts must not overshoot investment spending by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag plenary was nearly full on the second day of budget debates the finance minister told parliament on tuesday that the measure was needed to boost the economy and gain financial room to maneuver for greater consolidation in 2007 . " the 2006 budget is intended to create stronger economic growth and so provide the necessary tailwind to achieve our ambitious goals in 2007 , " he said .
" next year we are planning to invest considerably more and notably drive our deficit below the eu 's 3 percent limit . " staggering national debt the fresh borrowing , however , will increase germany 's national debt to a staggering 900 billion euros .
this mountain of debt alone requires servicing by the state to the tune of 40 billion euros in the current year .
meanwhile these interest payments coupled with staff expenditures , state contributions to the pensions system and huge spending on social welfare make up two-thirds of the entire budget . but steinbrück warned against populist calls from the opposition demanding sweeping cuts to these costs . despite the criticism , christian socialist union politician peter ramsauer said he was optimistic that the coalition could find a compromise , at least when it came to health care reform . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

although it won the most seats of any party , the outcome was far less than what opinion polls had forecast ahead of the ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert visits the west bank olmert , who shot to power only 12 weeks ago when prime minister ariel sharon suffered a massive stroke , campaigned on a plan to dismantle dozens of settlements and remove tens of thousands of jews from the west bank .
even though a majority of the members of parliament -lrb- mp -rrb- favors some kind of pullout from the west bank , which has been occupied by israel for nearly 40 years , olmert will be hard pressed to find a suitable coalition partner to achieve his ambitious goal of separating from the palestinians and establishing the final borders of the jewish state . possible partners the center-left labor party , predicted to emerge as the second force in parliament , garnered 20 seats .
it now looks forward to extracting social and economic concessions in exchange for joining the government with kadima .
led by amir peretzs , the party has also made clear it would prefer a negotiated solution with the palestinians to unilateral steps as favored by kadima . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor party leader amir peretz between them kadima and labor lack enough seats to form a majority on their own and will have to look for partners among some of the smaller factions , including the fledgling pensioners ' list and the left-wing , secular meretz party .
olmert will also most likely have to bring in the parliament 's two ultra-orthodox factions to secure enough seats in his coalition . the possible inclusion of he two religious parties shas and united torah judaism could make the coalition difficult as the two will likely want to ensure religious jews maintain the benefits and privileges so despised by meretz and unpopular with labor . however , robert rosenberg of haaretz newspaper told afp news sources that olmert " can rapidly form a relatively stable coalition , with the core comprised of kadima , labor and the pensioners , with meretz , united torah judaism and possibly shas on board . " redrawing israel 's borders what has become clear in the hours following the election is that the nationalist right that has dominated power since 1977 will be frozen out of the next government after likud , the traditional champion of the right , suffered a crushing defeat . " the strength of kadima has managed to destroy the right wing .
these elections are seen first and foremost as a referendum on the partitioning of land , " said political commentator ari shavit on israel 's channel one television . bildunterschrift : the removal of settlements is a major goal of kadima when all possible cooperating parties are taken together , those supporting a withdrawal from the west bank and a permanent definition of israel 's borders outweigh the opponents from the far-right .
" this plan has close to 80 seats .
two thirds of the people !
that 's the most dramatic thing that happened , " boasted incoming kadima mp haim ramon after televisions published their exit polls . " the left is now two-thirds of the knesset .
if olmert has the courage , he can dismantle the settlements and make peace and retreat , as he wants .
he has tremendous power in the knesset , " said arab israeli mp abdel malek dehamsheh . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exit polls : kadima wins narrow victory in israel election the ruling kadima party was on course to narrowly beat its rivals in israel 's election on tuesday , a crucial vote seen as a referendum on plans to finalize the borders of the jewish state .

although it won the most seats of any party , the outcome was far less than what opinion polls had forecast ahead of the ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud olmert visits the west bank olmert , who shot to power only 12 weeks ago when prime minister ariel sharon suffered a massive stroke , campaigned on a plan to dismantle dozens of settlements and remove tens of thousands of jews from the west bank .
even though a majority of the members of parliament -lrb- mp -rrb- favors some kind of pullout from the west bank , which has been occupied by israel for nearly 40 years , olmert will be hard pressed to find a suitable coalition partner to achieve his ambitious goal of separating from the palestinians and establishing the final borders of the jewish state . possible partners the center-left labor party , predicted to emerge as the second force in parliament , garnered 20 seats .
it now looks forward to extracting social and economic concessions in exchange for joining the government with kadima .

olmert will also most likely have to bring in the parliament 's two ultra-orthodox factions to secure enough seats in his coalition . the possible inclusion of he two religious parties shas and united torah judaism could make the coalition difficult as the two will likely want to ensure religious jews maintain the benefits and privileges so despised by meretz and unpopular with labor . however , robert rosenberg of haaretz newspaper told afp news sources that olmert " can rapidly form a relatively stable coalition , with the core comprised of kadima , labor and the pensioners , with meretz , united torah judaism and possibly shas on board .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2006 merkel 's first big health-care test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what changes lie in store for germany 's doctors and patients ?
one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ? up until now , germany 's grand coalition of social democrats and conservative cdu / csu parties has been slow to tackle major reforms . chancellor angela merkel has instead reveled in her winning appearances on the international stage .
political aides waited patiently for last sunday 's three major state elections to pass . this wednesday evening , the waiting will be over .
merkel will meet with the coalition 's political elite to reach agreement on one of the country 's most pressing and complicated reform projects : the health care system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel , still eye to eye ?
next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . social democrats , conservatives far apart the differences between the two sides remain wide . the social democrats have favored a system which abolishes the division between public and private health care .
critics say patients with private insurance receive preferential treatment .
their " citizen 's insurance " would mean that every insurance company would be required to insure every citizen regardless of risk , but would also eliminate tax loopholes for big-earners and freelancers .
the fees would depend on income .
the higher a person 's salary , the higher the rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias platzeck has laid down some rules the conservatives are absolutely against the idea .
they want a solidarity-based system that would require every adult to pay the same insurance fee regardless of income . rather than abolish the public-private divide in health insurance , the conservatives would seek to increase competition between the two . spd leader matthias platzeck , who will be taking part in the meetings wednesday night , has already marked out a few " do-not-cross " lines , including no drastic cutbacks in services and leaving open the possibility of increasing the employer 's share of the monthly premium .
he also ruled out the conservatives ' solidarity-based system . going for some " basic understanding " but the spd has shown itself open to the conservative plan to finance childrens ' health insurance through taxes .
whether there is any money in state coffers for that sort of solidarity is anybody 's guess . the divide between the two major parties continues to be wide - but merkel and her coalition counterparts , labor minister franz müntefering and platzeck , have already shown they are willing to compromise : they were able to form the government coalition in the first place .
but what about merkel 's goals in the talks ?
she wants the parties to reach some sort of " basic understanding . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de health care in germany - a matter of class ?
most agree that germany 's creaking health care system needs reform .
cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care .

so far eu aid could only be used to help farmers who have had an outbreak of avian influenza on their own property , or who can not send the produce to market because of veterinary restrictions .

" that is why we want to extend the scope of the existing regulations to allow eu co-financing of special market measures . " under the proposal , the commission would pick up half the cost of measures to help the market , hit by a drop in consumer confidence as the bird flu outbreaks spread across the eu . in effect by april ? if member states and the european parliament give the green light to the proposal , it could go into effect by the end of april .
then member states would have to submit proposals on aid to support the market to the commission .

following a string of first outbreaks in the eu , italy reported a 70 percent drop in poultry sales and france saw sales fall 15 percent . mann said that the commission had no centralized information about poultry sales and was relying on what member states reported . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .

but germany still has catching up to do . going by the calculations of the world economic forum , germany 's it sector has its work cut out for it .
after placing 14 in the organization 's internationally-respected it index in 2004-2005 , germany slipped to 17th last year , according to a newly published survey .
the global information technology report , which measures the involvement of a country 's economy in the global information technology network , placed european countries like sweden and iceland ahead of germany .
the us placed first . the news should be incentive enough for the german government to devote full attention to a year-long ministry of education and research program push to promote germany 's it sector in 2006 .
the program includes school competitions designed to recruit the next generation of it workers , a vanishing group in germany . giving the branch direction the program " will raise awareness , it will awake interest in a branch that apparently has a difficult time explaining itself , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of bitkom , germany 's it lobbying organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry suffers from a dearth of qualified candidates the program could also provide the sort of guidance needed in the it industry .
august wilhelm scheer , professor at the institute for economic information at the university of saarbrücken , said the government needs to loosen the reins and give the it branch direction .
" in every country where there 's been a turnaround , be it finland , north ireland , or south korea , there is always a political concept behind it that wants to see the information technology area pushed forward , " he said . following the dot-com bubble burst , and a severe dearth of qualified employees that prompted german politicians to introduce a green card specifically for the it industry , the branch shows signs of recovery .
together with the overall improved economic climate , the munich-based ifo institute 's new economic index on tuesday mentioned an upswing in new jobs in the it sector .
a first good test when it comes to information technology , germany belongs " in the top group with a few other countries , " said matthias jarke , the head of the renowned fraunhofer institute for applied information technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial electronic toll collect system malfunctioned and was widely panned to prove it , germany this year plans to introduce a new health care card that is outfitted with a chip filled with comprehensive patient information .
the most advanced card of its kind in the world will link an estimated 80 million cards with two million completely different systems located in hospitals , doctor 's and insurance offices . " such … projects always have a positive effect on exports , " jarke said .
should the country pull it off , that is : a similar national effort to build high-tech toll collection system spearheaded by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler had major problems before it was finally introduced in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : europe 's quaero project aims to challenge google some europeans are concerned about us hegemony in the worldwide information market .

the conclusion for the moment is that it would be too risky .

the scottish society for the prevention of cruelty to animals -lrb- sspca -rrb- said it had seen increasing numbers of bunnies dumped after the holidays .
sspca centres were overwhelmed with 690 abandoned pet rabbits last year - up by more than 100 on the previous year .
sspca vet ian futter said : " rabbits do not make ideal pets for young children . "
the warning comes after two cruelty cases involving rabbits this year .
in january , eight were abandoned near a main road in oban .
one of the rabbits died from exposure .
senior sspca inspector john mcavoy managed to catch five and a nearby family caught two , which they decided to keep .

he was rescued and taken to the dundee animal welfare centre for re-homing .
mr futter said rabbits had become almost as popular as dogs and cats .
he said : " rabbits are now the third most popular pet in the uk but contrary to popular belief , rabbits do not make ideal pets for young children .
" they are fragile creatures , requiring social interaction , daily exercise and plenty of attention .
" being prey animals , most rabbits will feel threatened or insecure when picked up and held .
rabbits do , however , make excellent pets in the right hands - but not child-size hands . "
diane stewart , manager of lothian animal welfare centre , said : " rabbits are not seasonal pets .
' baby rabbits ' " many people get them for children in the spring , but come winter they still need feeding and the hutch cleaning-out regularly .
" people get baby rabbits because they are appealing .
but as soon as they grow older , the family loses interest . "
mr futter added : " rabbits are actually more of a welfare issue than dogs and cats .
" there are thousands of rabbits out there - sitting in hutches at the bottom of gardens - suffering unnecessarily from total boredom .
" this is worse than physical pain because there is no end to it .
" they are intelligent and make great pets but owners must be responsible for their mental as well as their physical wellbeing .
they are social creatures and need social interaction . "

the scottish society for the prevention of cruelty to animals -lrb- sspca -rrb- said it had seen increasing numbers of bunnies dumped after the holidays .
sspca centres were overwhelmed with 690 abandoned pet rabbits last year - up by more than 100 on the previous year .
sspca vet ian futter said : " rabbits do not make ideal pets for young children . "
the warning comes after two cruelty cases involving rabbits this year .
in january , eight were abandoned near a main road in oban .
one of the rabbits died from exposure .
senior sspca inspector john mcavoy managed to catch five and a nearby family caught two , which they decided to keep .
the five captured by insp mcavoy were taken to the society 's inverness animal welfare centre , where they were later re-homed .
he is still investigating the abandonment .
rabbits are actually more of a welfare issue than dogs and cats sspca vet ian futter also in january , a domestic rabbit was dumped in a plastic carrier bag in the meadows in marchmont , edinburgh .
he was rescued and taken to the dundee animal welfare centre for re-homing .
mr futter said rabbits had become almost as popular as dogs and cats .
he said : " rabbits are now the third most popular pet in the uk but contrary to popular belief , rabbits do not make ideal pets for young children .
" they are fragile creatures , requiring social interaction , daily exercise and plenty of attention .
" being prey animals , most rabbits will feel threatened or insecure when picked up and held .
rabbits do , however , make excellent pets in the right hands - but not child-size hands . "
diane stewart , manager of lothian animal welfare centre , said : " rabbits are not seasonal pets .
' baby rabbits ' " many people get them for children in the spring , but come winter they still need feeding and the hutch cleaning-out regularly .
" people get baby rabbits because they are appealing .
but as soon as they grow older , the family loses interest . "
mr futter added : " rabbits are actually more of a welfare issue than dogs and cats .
" there are thousands of rabbits out there - sitting in hutches at the bottom of gardens - suffering unnecessarily from total boredom .
" this is worse than physical pain because there is no end to it .
" they are intelligent and make great pets but owners must be responsible for their mental as well as their physical wellbeing .
they are social creatures and need social interaction . "

this is the first time medical professionals have been jailed in such a case .
under indian laws , ultrasound tests on a pregnant woman to determine the gender of the foetus are illegal .
it has been estimated that 10m female foetuses may have been terminated in india in the past 20 years .
dr anil sabhani and kartar singh were caught in a sting operation in the northern state of haryana .
government officials sent in three pregnant women as decoy patients to find out if the clinic would carry out abortions based on sex selection .
audio and video evidence showed the doctor telling one woman that tests had revealed that she was carrying a " female foetus and it would be taken care of " . "
the judgement is historical " dr vinay agarwal , indian medical association a cultural preference for sons over daughters has skewed india 's sex ratio .
but convictions are rare due to lax and corrupt officials and the slow judicial system .
the government brought in laws 12 years ago to stop the practice of aborting female foetuses .
' social evil ' the president of the indian medical association -lrb- ima -rrb- , a grouping of doctors , dr vinay agarwal said the convictions were " historical " .
" the medical profession is doing all it can though we have to address this as a social evil .
people should be proud to have a girl child , " he said .
the northern states of punjab and haryana have some of the worst gender ratios in india .
there are about 861 women for every 1,000 men in haryana , according to the census .
the national average is 927 women to 1,000 men .
the national average has gone down from 972 in 1901 to just 933 in 2001 , according to reports .
earlier this year researchers in india and canada said in the lancet journal that prenatal selection and selective abortion was causing the loss of 500,000 girl births a year .
if this is true , 10m female births may have been lost in india over the past two decades .
indian doctors , however , disputed the report saying pre-birth gender checks had waned since a supreme court crackdown in 2001 .
tradition leading campaigners say many of india 's fertility clinics continue to offer a seemingly legitimate facade for a multi-billion pound racket and that gender determination is still big business in india .
experts in india say female foeticide is mostly linked to socio-economic factors .
it is an idea that many say carries over from the time india was a predominantly agrarian society where boys were considered an extra pair of hands on the farm .
the girl child has traditionally been considered inferior and a liability - a bride 's dowry can cripple a poor family financially .

indian doctors , however , disputed the report saying pre-birth gender checks had waned since a supreme court crackdown in 2001 .
tradition leading campaigners say many of india 's fertility clinics continue to offer a seemingly legitimate facade for a multi-billion pound racket and that gender determination is still big business in india .
experts in india say female foeticide is mostly linked to socio-economic factors .

it has been estimated that 10m female foetuses may have been terminated in india in the past 20 years .
dr anil sabhani and kartar singh were caught in a sting operation in the northern state of haryana .

there are about 861 women for every 1,000 men in haryana , according to the census .

the christmas spending spree did not continue into the new year , it warned , and consumer spending was expected to remain depressed in months to come .
pre-tax pre-exceptional profits fell to £ 43.7m from £ 54.9m , the company said .
icelandic group baugur , one of the largest foreign investors in the uk high street , has recently built up a 10 % stake in woolworths .
early last year , private equity firm apax abandoned a bid approach for woolworth , and there has been persistent speculation that baugur could make an offer .
under pressure the uk firm , which currently has 800 stores , said demand was below the levels seen during 2004 for most of last year , with sales of clothing suffering the worst because of price cutting from rival stores .
sales of entertainment products were hampered by a lack of major new releases and price deflation , though toy sales fared well and beat last year 's levels with stronger profit margins .
woolworths said its entertainment wholesale and publishing businesses , which includes euk and its 2entertain joint venture with the bbc , enjoyed a 14.9 % rise in profits to £ 56.4m.
" this was a year in which the tough conditions on the high street overshadowed the continued improvements in the underlying infrastructure of our business and a creditable trading performance , " said chief executive trevor bish-jones .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- social change slows polish birth rates bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 29 march 2006 , 07:43 gmt 08:43 uk social change slows polish birth rates in the latest in our series about motherhood and the role of the state in encouraging couples to have more children , the bbc 's adam easton in poland assesses why fertility rates are tumbling in this apparently family-oriented nation .
if you asked many people which countries are the most catholic and traditional in europe , they would probably answer either ireland or poland .
and in many respects they would be right .
according to surveys , around two-thirds of poles go to church every sunday and 70 % say that family and children are the most important things in their lives .
but while birth rates have been falling steadily across the continent for decades , the fertility rate in ireland is now 1.98 , not too far off the population replacement level of 2.1 .
in poland , it 's just 1.23 , among the bottom five in europe .
the country 's population actually fell by almost half a million over the last six years .
estimates suggest there will be four million fewer poles by 2030 .
so why are family-oriented poles having fewer babies ?
it is partly because there is a difference between what people say and what they do .
and it is also because polish society has been undergoing profound changes in recent decades .
' wife , where 's my dinner ? '
first , more and more young people , especially women , are going to college and university .
" women are becoming more and more demanding .
they want to get a job and career first so they 're not dependent on their husband later , " says 34-year-old anna jurczak , who has six-month-old twin boys .
" twenty years ago you had to get married young but in our generation , my friends and i , first of all we want to find a good job and then we can find someone we can love . "
and women are getting more choosy when it comes to picking a suitable husband , she says .
have your say " the decline in birth rates parallels the decline in the traditional family " mike , liverpool , uk send us your comments " i married when i was 29 .
i looked for a husband for a long time .
i was looking for somebody who could go to the kitchen and get his own food and find his own socks and underwear .
" i did n't want to be like my parents from the countryside .
they work together in the fields and when they come back home my father just sits down and says , ' wife , where 's my dinner ? '
there 's no partnership there .
i wanted my relationship to be based on partnership . "
another dramatic change came with the transition from communism to a market-based economy .
under communism unemployment officially did n't exist .
now , at 18 % , it 's the highest in the european union .
" when we got married my job was n't stable and that 's why we kept postponing a decision to start a family .
but because i was getting older we decided to have a child regardless , " anna says .
money worries as well as concerns about job security , there is a chronic housing shortage and many young people live with their parents because they can not afford a flat .
the cost of raising a family is also increasing .
fertility rate in europe 2.1 children per woman is considered to be the population replacement level .
these are national averages ireland : 1.99 france : 1.90 norway : 1.81 sweden 1.75 uk : 1.74 netherlands : 1.73 germany : 1.37 italy : 1.33 spain : 1.32 greece : 1.29 source : eurostat - 2004 figures at-a-glance : national policies " i used to earn quite a good salary and my husband still does so we could get a mortgage and buy a flat in warsaw .
but we have to watch all our pennies and economise .
for the time being i still have clothes handed down from my sister 's children .
the other day i went to a shop and bought two baby suits and i spent 52 zlotys -lsb- 13 euros ; $ 16 -rsb- .
it 's a lot for us .
of course i can buy in second-hand shops and i do , " anna says .
another reason why women are reluctant to break their career to start a family is because they fear they wo n't be able to get their jobs back after taking maternity leave .
" my friend came back from maternity leave and she was immediately sacked , allegedly because she had n't instructed her replacement well enough before she took leave .
i 'll look for a job again when my children are old enough but i 'm very pessimistic , " says anna .
it is a problem the new conservative government acknowledges .
" polish women have problems keeping their jobs when they are young because employers think , ' ah , maybe she 's going to be pregnant soon ' , and secondly , when a woman has a child employers often think she will be a worse worker , " says joanna kluzik-rostkowska , the new under-secretary for women and the family . "
we have big plans .
the ' baby bonus ' is only the first step " joanna kluzik-rostkowska under-secretary for women and the family the government has promised to build more flats for first-time buyers and introduce family-oriented legislation .
to encourage people to have more children it recently introduced a new law which gives couples a 1,000-zloty " baby bonus " for each child they have .
" we have big plans .
the ' baby bonus ' is only the first step .
we plan to extend maternity leave by two weeks , improve the running of public kindergartens , and we 're discussing the possibility of introducing tax breaks for parents , " mrs kluzik-rostkowska says .
more help needed professor irena kotowska of the institute of statistics and demography at the warsaw school of economics thinks the baby bonus is not " serious support " .
" the first thing to do is to help parents combine work and family duties , which means improving state-run child care centres , there is a huge shortage there , " she says .
just 20 % of working mothers use public kindergartens , while 40 % rely on family members to care for their children .
" then education needs to be more affordable and working practices should be organised to make them more family-friendly , " she says .
mrs kluzik-rostkowska admits it will not be easy to reverse poland 's falling birth rate .
" it 's a very big problem and i think we have a lot of work ahead of us .
i am an optimist and i think it will take about 15 years before we can start to reverse this trend , " she says .
anna says her husband does not want any more children because it is too expensive .
" i 'd like a daughter , so we 'll see what happens , " she says .

if you asked many people which countries are the most catholic and traditional in europe , they would probably answer either ireland or poland .
and in many respects they would be right .
women 's expectations of men are changing , says anna jurczak according to surveys , around two-thirds of poles go to church every sunday and 70 % say that family and children are the most important things in their lives .
but while birth rates have been falling steadily across the continent for decades , the fertility rate in ireland is now 1.98 , not too far off the population replacement level of 2.1 .
in poland , it 's just 1.23 , among the bottom five in europe .
the country 's population actually fell by almost half a million over the last six years .
estimates suggest there will be four million fewer poles by 2030 .
so why are family-oriented poles having fewer babies ?
it is partly because there is a difference between what people say and what they do .
and it is also because polish society has been undergoing profound changes in recent decades .
' wife , where 's my dinner ? '
first , more and more young people , especially women , are going to college and university .
" women are becoming more and more demanding .
they want to get a job and career first so they 're not dependent on their husband later , " says 34-year-old anna jurczak , who has six-month-old twin boys .
" twenty years ago you had to get married young but in our generation , my friends and i , first of all we want to find a good job and then we can find someone we can love . "
and women are getting more choosy when it comes to picking a suitable husband , she says .

i looked for a husband for a long time .
i was looking for somebody who could go to the kitchen and get his own food and find his own socks and underwear .
" i did n't want to be like my parents from the countryside .
they work together in the fields and when they come back home my father just sits down and says , ' wife , where 's my dinner ? '
there 's no partnership there .
i wanted my relationship to be based on partnership . "
another dramatic change came with the transition from communism to a market-based economy .
under communism unemployment officially did n't exist .
now , at 18 % , it 's the highest in the european union .
" when we got married my job was n't stable and that 's why we kept postponing a decision to start a family .
but because i was getting older we decided to have a child regardless , " anna says .
money worries as well as concerns about job security , there is a chronic housing shortage and many young people live with their parents because they can not afford a flat .
the cost of raising a family is also increasing .

another reason why women are reluctant to break their career to start a family is because they fear they wo n't be able to get their jobs back after taking maternity leave .

food and farming alliance sustain spokesman richard watts said : " unless kids are protected from junk food adverts during programmes like x factor , the bill or i 'm a celebrity ... new rules will be meaningless . "
a coalition of multi-national food companies , advertising agencies and the broadcast media , the food advertising unit , said advertising targeting children needed to change .
but other measures would be needed to change eating habits and tackle childhood obesity in the long term , it added .
food and drink federation director general melanie leech said the food and drink manufacturing industry recognised " a range of concerns relating to advertising and promotion to children " .
" as set out in our food and health manifesto , we are committed to working with ofcom and government , and we will study the detail of the consultation and respond in due course , " she said .

men missing out on health screening as a relatively healthy 40-year-old male it strikes me that there is too little being done to alert men to the potentially life-threatening cancers that are out there .
send us your views there are various screening procedures set up for women - breast screening , smear testing and in most medical centres these days there are also well woman clinics offering additional guidance on various women 's health-related checks .
a few years back we had a premiership football player very publicly diagnosed as having testicular cancer .
during that time , and for a few weeks after , we had some very good reporting on the subject but in the main there is nothing in the press or in local community health bulletins about this potentially life-threatening condition .
the same goes for male prostate cancer .
i heard billy connolly say he 'd been for a prostate test once and apart from the week or two after that , these male afflictions are suddenly not fashionable or worthy of being reported on .
early warning for those that do n't know , the football player went on to make a full recovery after treatment and still enjoys playing the game to this day .
i am not for a second suggesting that there are too many " women 's issues " , far from it , i 'm also taking part in the moonbeams walk for breast cancer this year .
but male issues should be brought to the fore and people should be made aware that screening and self-checking is the best way possible to get an early diagnosis and perhaps the early treatment that might just go to saving a life . "
we males are being left behind " what i find astounding is that with such a male orientated parliament , both in scotland and the uk , and also such a large male influence in the medical world , why are there not people screaming and shouting from the rafters about male check-ups ?
is it down to cost ?
are there political correctness procedures in place to stop any men only issues ?
we males are being left behind and far from these subjects being avoided we should be asking our msps and mps to ensure there is an equal balance in targeting male age groups that might benefit from regular screening schedules .
the cost benefit to the health service would surely be great if all of the people that get diagnosed too late are found and treated earlier .
less palliative care , less devastated families living with the spectre of these male illnesses and possibly other things picked up earlier .

the house of commons culture , media and sport committee has urged the government to offer vulnerable groups more financial and practical help .
plans to switch to digital tv by 2012 are expected to cost the " average household " between £ 80 and £ 570 .
help the aged welcomed the proposals outlined in the " robust " report .
the committee 's report said the government needed to do more to tell the public why they had chosen to proceed with analogue switch-off and what options were available .
it added that the government 's assistance programme was " too restricted " and failed to acknowledge those who are in genuine need .
analogue switch-off will start in 2008 and be completed by 2012 it called for a comprehensive awareness campaign to let older people know that analogue switch-off would begin in 2008 .
committee chairman john whittingdale said : " currently there are too many people who do not qualify for government assistance , yet are in genuine need .
" if switch-off is to be a success , there must be no-one who wakes up on the day to discover that they are watching a blank screen . "
the government said it would carefully consider the committee 's recommendations and ensure that " no-one gets left behind " .
culture minister james purnell said there would be " a comprehensive package of help for those who independent research tells us are most in need of it - over-75s and people with significant disabilities " .
mr purnell said digital tv offered " more choice and better quality " and would be " affordable for the vast majority of people " .
but he pointed out that a quarter of the uk population could not currently receive digital services through an aerial .
" only by switching over fully to digital can we address this .
so it 's not just the right decision , it 's the fair one . "
the committee also called for a dedicated " digital minister " to oversee the switchover .
' visible champion ' " the problem is for those people who are n't planning to do it , do n't want to do it , ca n't afford to do it or do n't understand the technology , " bbc media correspondent torin douglas told radio five live .
" what they say is needed is a minister who will lead from the front , who will be a ' visible champion ' to show that if something is going wrong , they will take action and make sure it gets put right . "
ford ennals , chief executive of digital uk - the industry group co-ordinating the change to digital - said : " digital uk is very aware of the need to explain to consumers the reasons for switchover and their options for going digital .
" we will launch our first national programme of information and support in may .

splits were sold as a low-risk way to invest in shares , but when markets fell sharply in 2000 , investors lost money .
they will share in £ 143m set aside after a deal in 2004 , between the investment firms concerned and the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- .
the first payout will be set at 40p in the pound , which will see investors being offered £ 115m .
the rest of the money will be paid in a second tranche later this year which may come to a further 9p in the pound .
the average loss per investment was £ 6,400 , but the average loss per person was £ 11,400 , as many applicants held more than one investment .
but investors will not be compensated for all the losses they suffered .
the company set up to channel the payments to the investors , fund distribution ltd , says it has identified losses among the claimants amounting to £ 291m .
turned down some applicants had their claims turned down .
about 3,000 did not qualify , because they had not invested in the type of fund covered by the compensation scheme - zero dividend preference shares - which must have been held between 1 july 2000 and 30 june 2002 .
and 10,000 other people either made money on their investments or their losses were less than the £ 250 lower limit set for compensation .
fund distribution 's offer will be sent out this week and the applicants will have six weeks to decide whether they are going to accept .
if they do , they will have to surrender their right to make any other claims , either through the courts or to the financial ombudsman service .
investors who chose to accept their offer will need to return the formal acceptance forms by 4.30 pm on monday , 15 may 2006 or the offer will lapse .
payment will be made about four weeks after the acceptances have been received .
scandal the scandal of the split capital investment trusts emerged a few years ago , when the shaky nature of their investment policies was exposed by the sudden three-year long slump in share prices .
the investment trusts had been sold to thousands of private investors , who were often given the impression they were relatively safe investments when , in fact , they were very risky .
the fsa launched an investigation into split-caps in may 2002 .
the investigation was huge and involved 780 files of evidence , detailing 27,000 taped conversations and more than 70 interviews .
the fsa presented its evidence to the firms in an effort to shame them into offering compensation , because at the time the investments were sold , the fsa did not regulate the investment trust industry .
after months of negotiations , 20 split-cap firms finally agreed , in december 2004 , to pay into a compensation fund worth £ 143m .

health officials issued the alert after a male member of staff at the university hospital of north durham tested positive for the virus .
it is feared he could have spread the bug between 13 and 17 march .
although rare , measles is easily spread through normal contact and can be serious for children , pregnant women and those with weak immune systems .
the county durham and darlington acute hospitals nhs trust said the staff member involved did not work in obstetrics , gynaecology , or paediatric departments .
raised temperature bob aitken , medical director at the trust , said : " although unfortunately some people may already have been infected with measles while visiting the hospital this month , we want to minimise the chances of the infection being passed to anyone else .
" we would urge members of the public to be vigilant for the signs of this illness so that they can seek advice from their gp by telephone . "
it usually takes about two weeks from catching measles to becoming ill .
early symptoms include raised temperature , a cough and red and watery eyes .
spots associated with measles normally appear a few days later on the neck or hairline .
a trust spokesman said : " if people show these symptoms they should not attend their gp surgery , gp walk-in centre , or hospital a & e unit , as measles is easily spread to others at this stage .
" if someone is very unwell , they can of course attend a & e , but is important that on arrival they mention they have a rash and have possibly had contact with a case of measles . "

health officials issued the alert after a male member of staff at the university hospital of north durham tested positive for the virus .
it is feared he could have spread the bug between 13 and 17 march .
although rare , measles is easily spread through normal contact and can be serious for children , pregnant women and those with weak immune systems .
the county durham and darlington acute hospitals nhs trust said the staff member involved did not work in obstetrics , gynaecology , or paediatric departments .
raised temperature bob aitken , medical director at the trust , said : " although unfortunately some people may already have been infected with measles while visiting the hospital this month , we want to minimise the chances of the infection being passed to anyone else .
" we would urge members of the public to be vigilant for the signs of this illness so that they can seek advice from their gp by telephone . "
it usually takes about two weeks from catching measles to becoming ill .
early symptoms include raised temperature , a cough and red and watery eyes .
spots associated with measles normally appear a few days later on the neck or hairline .
a trust spokesman said : " if people show these symptoms they should not attend their gp surgery , gp walk-in centre , or hospital a & e unit , as measles is easily spread to others at this stage .
" if someone is very unwell , they can of course attend a & e , but is important that on arrival they mention they have a rash and have possibly had contact with a case of measles . "

' unacceptable ' in the light of the delays , the uk government had now decided to let doctors use alternative computer systems , said accenture chief financial officer mike mcgrath .

speaking in new zealand , he said it was important to develop machines which produced fewer emissions , while maintaining economic growth .
mr blair promised to push for an international framework to supersede the kyoto protocol when it expires .
the speech came after the government admitted it was unlikely to meet its target for cutting greenhouse gases .
as part of the prime minister 's marathon diplomatic mission , he is due to visit indonesia on wednesday .
developing world downing street said mr blair had identified 2006 as the year to get an international consensus on the goal of stabilising the earth 's temperature .
in his speech in auckland , the prime minister said the framework to replace kyoto - which expires at the end of 2012 - must include china , india and the us . "
there is more that government can and will do to meet the target " margaret beckett , environment secretary uk misses the climate bus solutions needed to be applicable to the developing world , he added .
the bbc 's political editor nick robinson said mr blair 's move was " essentially pushing to one side all hopes that america would be chivvied or bullied to signing up to the kyoto agreement " .
it was " pushing aside hopes that newly developed countries like china and india can be brought in , too " , he said .
the prime minister says a less ambitious agreement which " stabilises climate change , and stabilises greenhouse emissions " is a real priority this year , our correspondent said .
new policies a government report published on tuesday said the uk was unlikely to meet its target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 % by 2010 .
the climate change programme review projects that new and existing policies would deliver a cut of 15 to18 % .
the government wants people to cut their personal emissions and is promising a stricter emissions cap for industry .
have your say " the cost is too high and there are no incentives ! "
karen , nottingham , uk send us your comments it is also pledging £ 80m over next three years for microgeneration projects and tighter building regulations .
environment secretary margaret beckett said the government was not giving up on the 20 % goal , but said more had to be done to reach it .
she added : " this programme contains a package of far-reaching measures that will affect all the major sectors and sources of uk emissions .
" but it is not the last word .
there is more that government can and will do to meet the target . "
' short-term pressures ' meanwhile , downing street has revealed the carbon dioxide emissions from the prime minister 's plane will be " offset " by making an investment in " energy-saving technology " in the developing world .
from april , all ministerial flights will follow suit , it was added .
friends of the earth director tony juniper accused the government of failing to take the " tough action " on climate change .
he said : " once again the government has caved in to short-term political pressures and produced a totally inadequate response .
" this pathetic strategy will not deliver the government 's promise to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 % by 2010 , and will further undermine the prime minister 's reputation on this issue . "
shadow environment secretary peter ainsworth said the review was " a grim admission of failure " , adding : " worse still , it fails to chart a course which will get us back on track .
" the government 's efforts to tackle climate change remain piecemeal , timid and half-hearted . "
liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell said : " the review is nine months late and a failure .
this is much bigger than a sidelined labour manifesto pledge and a whitehall turf-war .
" the prime minister must call his ministers to account .
he must explain to the nation how he will get britain back on target to reduce climate change . "

speaking in new zealand , he said it was important to develop machines which produced fewer emissions , while maintaining economic growth .
mr blair promised to push for an international framework to supersede the kyoto protocol when it expires .
the speech came after the government admitted it was unlikely to meet its target for cutting greenhouse gases .
as part of the prime minister 's marathon diplomatic mission , he is due to visit indonesia on wednesday .

the shows in december will be their only planned uk performance .
tickets have gone to fans as far away as russia itself , as well as the usa , the middle east and france .
the capacity of the cardiff venue has had to be reduced from 1,900 to 1,650 because of the size of the orchestra needed to play wagner 's music .

among the few lucky enough to buy top price tickets are retired patent attorney david mere and his translator wife kathleen , from near berne in switzerland .
the couple have not visited wales millennium centre before , but they are certain that the trip will be value for money .
" someone told me the other day the millennium centre is absolutely fabulous and we 're greatly looking forward to it , " said mrs mere .
" some people think paying £ 100 to watch football is value for money - for us £ 750 to watch the ring cycle is not expensive .
" it 's rare to get a chance to see the four operas in four consecutive days with a large enough ensemble for key cast members to be able to rest between performances .
" one works hard and one spends one 's money on the things one loves , " she added .

fans from across the world have bought seats costing as much as £ 750 for the performance by russia 's mariinsky theatre - formerly the kirov opera .
the shows in december will be their only planned uk performance .
tickets have gone to fans as far away as russia itself , as well as the usa , the middle east and france .
the capacity of the cardiff venue has had to be reduced from 1,900 to 1,650 because of the size of the orchestra needed to play wagner 's music .
tickets went on sale at 1000 bst on monday , and had all gone by 1400 bst .
the cheapest were £ 80 , while the top price of £ 750 buys a so-called " superseat " which will include a champagne reception with the cast .
among the few lucky enough to buy top price tickets are retired patent attorney david mere and his translator wife kathleen , from near berne in switzerland .
the couple have not visited wales millennium centre before , but they are certain that the trip will be value for money .
" someone told me the other day the millennium centre is absolutely fabulous and we 're greatly looking forward to it , " said mrs mere .
" some people think paying £ 100 to watch football is value for money - for us £ 750 to watch the ring cycle is not expensive .
" it 's rare to get a chance to see the four operas in four consecutive days with a large enough ensemble for key cast members to be able to rest between performances .
" one works hard and one spends one 's money on the things one loves , " she added .
millennium centre chief executive judith isherwood said : " we always expected to sell out the ring cycle .
" but we have been absolutely thrilled that it sold out so quickly .
the cycle is described as a mythical masterpiece ' " it is hugely exciting for us and will undoubtedly consolidate wales millennium centre 's place on the international cultural map . "

here is the full text of deputy assistant commission john yates ' letter to tony wright , chairman of the commons public administration committee .
re : honours -lrb- prevention of abuses -rrb- act 1925 i refer to our telephone conversation of friday evening concerning the above .
for the record , in that conversation i registered my concerns in relation to the proposed public affairs select committee meeting commencing on tuesday 28th march 2006 .
i indicated to you that many of the individuals that you wished to hear evidence from may be the very people that could be central to our criminal inquiry , either as witnesses or suspects .
my concerns were that your scrutiny could be viewed as an abuse of process in terms of fairness in any future potential criminal trial .
i have consulted closely with senior lawyers from the crown prosecution service about this matter .
they share my concerns and are happy for them to be articulated in this letter .
i do , of course , recognise that our enquiries are at a very early stage and that charges are not imminent .
i therefore concede that these matters can not be considered sub-judice at this stage .
i also recognise the authority of parliament to consider and scrutinise these matters under article 9 of the 1689 bill of rights .
i would however ask you to take into account the recommendations contained in the report by the joint committee on parliamentary privilege dated 9th april 1999 -lrb- hc 214 1998/1999 -rrb- .
in this report , the joint committee concluded that " corruption , a serious and insidious offence , could only be dealt with effectively by using the police and the courts .
prosecution through the courts is the only credible remedy and the only credible deterrent for any briber " .
whilst it may be too early for us to widen our investigation into the arena of corruption , i certainly have not ruled this out .
i would argue , therefore , that the principle articulated in the joint committee report remains a valid one for you to consider .
i am more than happy to assist you personally on these matters and would be content , if necessary , to provide a briefing around the structure and terms of reference of my investigation to the committee if you thought this would be helpful .
i would be very grateful if you could inform me , at your earliest convenience , whether and to what extent you intend to continue with your inquiry .
please do not hesitate to contact me if there are any other matters that require clarification .

here is the full text of deputy assistant commission john yates ' letter to tony wright , chairman of the commons public administration committee .
re : honours -lrb- prevention of abuses -rrb- act 1925 i refer to our telephone conversation of friday evening concerning the above .
for the record , in that conversation i registered my concerns in relation to the proposed public affairs select committee meeting commencing on tuesday 28th march 2006 .
i indicated to you that many of the individuals that you wished to hear evidence from may be the very people that could be central to our criminal inquiry , either as witnesses or suspects .
my concerns were that your scrutiny could be viewed as an abuse of process in terms of fairness in any future potential criminal trial .
i have consulted closely with senior lawyers from the crown prosecution service about this matter .
they share my concerns and are happy for them to be articulated in this letter .
i do , of course , recognise that our enquiries are at a very early stage and that charges are not imminent .
i therefore concede that these matters can not be considered sub-judice at this stage .
i also recognise the authority of parliament to consider and scrutinise these matters under article 9 of the 1689 bill of rights .
i would however ask you to take into account the recommendations contained in the report by the joint committee on parliamentary privilege dated 9th april 1999 -lrb- hc 214 1998/1999 -rrb- .
in this report , the joint committee concluded that " corruption , a serious and insidious offence , could only be dealt with effectively by using the police and the courts .
prosecution through the courts is the only credible remedy and the only credible deterrent for any briber " .
whilst it may be too early for us to widen our investigation into the arena of corruption , i certainly have not ruled this out .
i would argue , therefore , that the principle articulated in the joint committee report remains a valid one for you to consider .
i am more than happy to assist you personally on these matters and would be content , if necessary , to provide a briefing around the structure and terms of reference of my investigation to the committee if you thought this would be helpful .
i would be very grateful if you could inform me , at your earliest convenience , whether and to what extent you intend to continue with your inquiry .
please do not hesitate to contact me if there are any other matters that require clarification .
