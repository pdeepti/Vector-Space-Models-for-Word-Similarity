" two-thirds -lrb- of eu members -rrb- are behind the constitution , " he said .
" i believe everyone should feel an obligation because of that . " if it is to be saved , and we urgently need it , everyone has to move their position .
but some have to move more than others , " he added . without naming other countries , he admitted to having seen encouraging signs out of warsaw and paris . votes for and against bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france was among the countries that voted against the constitution in may , finland 's parliament voted in favor of the constitution , while romania and bulgaria - which are expected to enter the european union in 2007 - will join the 15 who have ratified it for a two-thirds majority , steinmeier said . all eu members would have to ratify the constitution for it to be valid . the treaty was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu after expansion into eastern europe raised its size to 25 countries , but fears over enlargement , particularly turkey 's bid to join the bloc , were seen as the major reason for the rejection of the constitution . constitutional road map would be a success hopes are high that germany can get europe on track after the french and dutch rejections plunged the bloc into crisis last year . steinmeier , whose spd governs in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , wanted to push down expectations for a breakthrough during germany 's six months with the eu presidency 's gavel , which begin jan .
1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't want expectations too high last week merkel said her government would lay out a " vision " by the end of its presidency to try and unite all sides without watering down the original charter . " i 'm against cherry picking , we must n't just quickly pick out what we think is easiest and leave the rest lying , but tackle things with ambition , " it would be a success for the eu if member states could reach agreement on a blueprint calling for continued work on the treaty . " there will not be a final result at the end of the german presidency , but rather , if things go well , there will be a decision to continue work for a constitution that is connected to a decision about model and schedule , " he said . steinmeier 's colleague and spd party head kurt beck agreed , saying " natural and cultural sensitivities -lrb- as seen in holland and france 's rejection of the constitution -rrb- could be added into a preamble in the eu constitution . " " our goal is nevertheless ambitious , " beck said .
" we do n't need any compromises on formula but rather a solution that makes europe able to work and fit for the future . " steinmeier said germany 's task would be to serve as a mediator in getting a road map on track .
he said germany should listen to eu members ' views and hold off on making its own suggestions until the end of the presidency . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

" like its neighbors , the small but wealthy country has made its borders tighter , " commented freiburg 's badische zeitung newspaper , from just over the border .
" however , if one looks closely , the law also includes improvements for asylum seekers and immigrants .
for example , rejected asylum seekers who for humanitarian reasons will not be deported are to receive a work permit .
a provision for hardship cases also entitles them to a residence permit if they have been successfully integrated .
this double strategy unexpectedly brought the right-wing populist -lrb- justice minister christoph -rrb- blocher great acclamation .
everyday practice will show which of the two sides of the new law will have the stronger effect . " " is the blocherization of switzerland now a threat ?
asked the südkurier , another german daily working from near the border , in constance .
" the -lrb- voters ' -rrb- decision is certainly problematic , but due to the entirely different democratic system , a shift to the right ca n't be read from it .
referendums in the confederation are always snapshots .
in contrast to 1992 , this time the right managed to put the issue of asylum abuse in the forefront .
thus , voters who think little of blocher also said yes .
every nation certainly has the right to enact clear regulations so that legislation regarding guests is n't taken advantage of .
nevertheless , there is unease .
among every stream of refugees there are persecuted people who must be helped without bureaucracy .
switzerland is battening down the hatches against them too - confident that others will come to their assistance .
the germans , for example . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in italy : switzerland plans to rely on its neighbors to avoid accepting refugees " amnesty international and the un refugee organization have reacted to the tightening of the asylum and foreigner legislation with criticism , " wrote spanish daily el mundo .
" the new regulation , among other things , allows illegal immigrants who show up in switzerland to be arrested .
the result of the referendum is understandable , however , if one takes into account that every fifth inhabitant of switzerland is of foreign origin .
thus , the proportion of foreigners is far higher than the average in the european union .
there is , as one minister put it , not room for everyone there . " " europe is so coveted among refugees as well as by migrants , because it is europe : because of its prosperity , but also its code of values - which are closely tied , " commented austria 's der standard newspaper .
" at the same time , europe is still far from finding a common answer to the asylum and migration problem .
that was demonstrated again just recently at the meeting of eu interior and justice ministers in tampere .
attempts to dismantle the principle of unanimity and to come to a common asylum and immigration policy through majority decisions still fail due to broad resistance .
many countries do n't want to cede sovereign rights , because they believe they will cope with the problems better irregardless of other states . " " such overwhelming majorities for the legislation on foreigners and especially for the revision of asylum law were not expected , " the neue zürcher zeitung pointed out .
" and , in as far as votes on migration policies are n't only about concrete contents but also about general attitudes to foreigners , the massive double yes ca n't leave liberal supporters pleased .
if the approval of tightening asylum law expresses more than concerns about administrative difficulties with a couple thousand rejected applicants without travel documents , it opens up a broad field for interpretation .
crime , the loss of economic and cultural certainties or islam as a bogeyman are common keywords in explanation attempts .
but more precise analyses and conclusions are tasks for more than just the day of the referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocher and his party got their way " there can be no argument about it : a good two-thirds of the voters said yes to the new asylum law , " wrote zurich 's tages-anzeiger .
" the discontent is too great about foreigners who deceive the authorities to get admission to switzerland , the paradise of prosperity .
the abuse dominated the discussion - the opponents failed to lead it in other directions and experienced a crushing defeat . … the clear result will namely give a boost to those powers within the -lrb- blocher 's -rrb- swiss people 's party , who want to take advantage of the still diffuse fears of the foreign in order to reap election successes .
" thus , the swiss people 's party will in the future only make an issue of abuse and attempt to torpedo the integration of the foreigners who live here , " the paper continued .
" the other mainstream parties must not let that happen .
for , yesterday the people also clearly said yes to the new law on foreigners that is supposed to improve integration . … if the double yes leads to the center parties relegating the abuse discussion to the past and embracing integration , good will also have come from yesterday 's result .

" i should like to reiterate all the esteem and the profound respect that i have for muslim believers , " the pontiff told the ambassadors and charge d 'affaires he invited to his summer residence south of rome . his audience included envoys from iran , turkey and morocco and was the latest step in a diplomatic offensive by the vatican aimed at mollifying muslim anger over recent comments by the pope . " in a world marked by relativism and too often excluding the transcendence and universality of reason , we are in great need of an authentic dialogue between religions and between cultures , capable of assisting us , in a spirit of fruitful co-operation , to overcome all the tensions together , " the pope said . in a speech on sept .
12 while visiting his native germany , benedict quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " " i am profoundly convinced that in the current world situation it is imperative that christians and muslims engage with one another in order to address the numerous challenges that present themselves to humanity , " the pope said . " christians and muslims must learn to work together ... in order to guard against all forms of intolerance and to oppose all manifestations of violence , " he added . trying to " build bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's meeting with muslims monday took less than a half hour the meeting at castel gandolfo , which had been heavily promoted by the vatican as a major step in reaffirming the pope 's commitment to inter-religious harmony , lasted barely 30 minutes . after his address , the pope shook hands and exchanged a few words with the assembled envoys , some of whom expressed satisfaction with the meeting . " i think it is time to put what happened behind us and build bridges among all the civilizations , " said iraqi ambassador albert yelda , who nevertheless defended the anger that had surfaced over the pope 's comments earlier this month . " many muslims around the world were offended , " yelda said .
" they expressed their feelings and they were right to do so .
everybody has a right to express his feelings . " a furor erupted in the muslim world following the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in germany , in which he quoted the medieval emperor who equated islam with violence . since then , thousands of muslims in iran , afghanistan and the gaza strip have protested against the pope 's remarks . while insisting that the content of his lecture had been misinterpreted , the pope sought to calm the situation last week , repeatedly saying he was " deeply sorry " for any offence muslims might have taken from his comments . the italian paper la repubblica reported that in the over 2,000-year-old history of the catholic church , a pope has never had to publicly express regret over his statements several times . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an instrument of suppression or harmless clothing of choice ?
the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this is certainly a serious blow to maglev , but hopefully german officials will get to the heart of what caused the tragedy .
their will be attempts to stop maglev , but if handled openly and correctly , it will go on and grow and be better for the experience .
every new technology has its first-use tragedies , i.e. , the airplane , the rocket , the space shuttle , even the automobile . - georg kniss , usa the transrapid project should not be abandoned because of the untypical absence of a failsafe mechanism / technology . - william wirthmann i 'm sorry to hear about the crash of the transrapid and express my sympathy to the victims and their families .
but considering the human error angle of the crash and the relatively accident-free operation over the > 20 years they have been testing it and the operation in shanghai , the casualty number is relatively low and the survival rate -lrb- ~ 30 percent -rrb- relatively high , comparing the incident to airplane , car / bus and conventional railway crashes . - best of all : there was no fire -lrb- because there is no fuel on board -rrb- .
this looks like a typical screw-up , just like the only two accidents of the wuppertaler schwebebahn were .
the service car was on the transrapid track by stupid negligence .
another detail that probably contributed to the casualty number : in the shots of transrapid interiors i could not detect seat belts .
one can not offer any new cars without them , every airplane has them .
the interior safety standards of the transrapid should be at least as good as the tüv and most other safety control bodies worldwide require for cars : seatbelts and airbags .
another well-known safety enhancement : all seats should face backwards !
anything less is criminal negligence .
too bad that now it 's going to be even less likely that we will see a transrapid line in germany , but you can bet there will be many in asia .
the chinese are already talking about one from beijing to singapore via bangkok and kuala lumpur and a possible extension to india , and on to europe .
i 'd love to take the transrapid -lrb- or its chinese copy -rrb- to propel me from my old home town köln to bangkok and shanghai at 500 km / h before i die !
if the trans-siberian railway could be built almost 100 years ago , why not now a trans-eurasian-express ?
airplanes are old tech , airports now are protective detention camps for travelers , with ever-bigger , megalomaniac super-jumbo airplanes serving as paddy wagons .
everybody i know hates to fly .
the new transportation systems have to be clean , fast , frequent , punctual , energy-efficient , environmentally and ethically acceptable , comfortable , low-hassle and humane .
only the maglev principle will make this possible . - dr jerry hess , san diego , ca , usa i love all types of trains , and i think that the transrapid represents the future of high-speed railway .
i hope that siemens will continue the researches in this field despite all difficulties . - doru pop-beg i am very sad regarding this crash with the maglev train .
it is a pity because this " projekt zukunft " is very good for big cities and to link airport to downtown . - rogerio petres , belo horizonte , brazil compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany optimistic about train technology despite setback after a german maglev train crash last week , industry experts are optimistic that the technology remains attractive to investors , especially those who wish to expand the transrapid system in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2006 switzerland battens down the hatches against foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 400 opponents of the new law demonstrated in zurich after the referendum swiss voters on sunday approved legislation that would give their country some of the most restrictive legislation on asylum seekers in europe , sparking criticism from papers around europe . " like its neighbors , the small but wealthy country has made its borders tighter , " commented freiburg 's badische zeitung newspaper , from just over the border .
" however , if one looks closely , the law also includes improvements for asylum seekers and immigrants .
for example , rejected asylum seekers who for humanitarian reasons will not be deported are to receive a work permit .
a provision for hardship cases also entitles them to a residence permit if they have been successfully integrated .
this double strategy unexpectedly brought the right-wing populist -lrb- justice minister christoph -rrb- blocher great acclamation .
everyday practice will show which of the two sides of the new law will have the stronger effect . " " is the blocherization of switzerland now a threat ?
asked the südkurier , another german daily working from near the border , in constance .
" the -lrb- voters ' -rrb- decision is certainly problematic , but due to the entirely different democratic system , a shift to the right ca n't be read from it .
referendums in the confederation are always snapshots .
in contrast to 1992 , this time the right managed to put the issue of asylum abuse in the forefront .
thus , voters who think little of blocher also said yes .
every nation certainly has the right to enact clear regulations so that legislation regarding guests is n't taken advantage of .
nevertheless , there is unease .
among every stream of refugees there are persecuted people who must be helped without bureaucracy .
switzerland is battening down the hatches against them too - confident that others will come to their assistance .
the germans , for example . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in italy : switzerland plans to rely on its neighbors to avoid accepting refugees " amnesty international and the un refugee organization have reacted to the tightening of the asylum and foreigner legislation with criticism , " wrote spanish daily el mundo .
" the new regulation , among other things , allows illegal immigrants who show up in switzerland to be arrested .
the result of the referendum is understandable , however , if one takes into account that every fifth inhabitant of switzerland is of foreign origin .
thus , the proportion of foreigners is far higher than the average in the european union .
there is , as one minister put it , not room for everyone there . " " europe is so coveted among refugees as well as by migrants , because it is europe : because of its prosperity , but also its code of values - which are closely tied , " commented austria 's der standard newspaper .
" at the same time , europe is still far from finding a common answer to the asylum and migration problem .
that was demonstrated again just recently at the meeting of eu interior and justice ministers in tampere .
attempts to dismantle the principle of unanimity and to come to a common asylum and immigration policy through majority decisions still fail due to broad resistance .
many countries do n't want to cede sovereign rights , because they believe they will cope with the problems better irregardless of other states . " " such overwhelming majorities for the legislation on foreigners and especially for the revision of asylum law were not expected , " the neue zürcher zeitung pointed out .
" and , in as far as votes on migration policies are n't only about concrete contents but also about general attitudes to foreigners , the massive double yes ca n't leave liberal supporters pleased .
if the approval of tightening asylum law expresses more than concerns about administrative difficulties with a couple thousand rejected applicants without travel documents , it opens up a broad field for interpretation .
crime , the loss of economic and cultural certainties or islam as a bogeyman are common keywords in explanation attempts .
but more precise analyses and conclusions are tasks for more than just the day of the referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocher and his party got their way " there can be no argument about it : a good two-thirds of the voters said yes to the new asylum law , " wrote zurich 's tages-anzeiger .
" the discontent is too great about foreigners who deceive the authorities to get admission to switzerland , the paradise of prosperity .
the abuse dominated the discussion - the opponents failed to lead it in other directions and experienced a crushing defeat . … the clear result will namely give a boost to those powers within the -lrb- blocher 's -rrb- swiss people 's party , who want to take advantage of the still diffuse fears of the foreign in order to reap election successes .
" thus , the swiss people 's party will in the future only make an issue of abuse and attempt to torpedo the integration of the foreigners who live here , " the paper continued .
" the other mainstream parties must not let that happen .
for , yesterday the people also clearly said yes to the new law on foreigners that is supposed to improve integration . … if the double yes leads to the center parties relegating the abuse discussion to the past and embracing integration , good will also have come from yesterday 's result .

" two-thirds -lrb- of eu members -rrb- are behind the constitution , " he said .
" i believe everyone should feel an obligation because of that . " if it is to be saved , and we urgently need it , everyone has to move their position .
but some have to move more than others , " he added . without naming other countries , he admitted to having seen encouraging signs out of warsaw and paris . votes for and against bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france was among the countries that voted against the constitution in may , finland 's parliament voted in favor of the constitution , while romania and bulgaria - which are expected to enter the european union in 2007 - will join the 15 who have ratified it for a two-thirds majority , steinmeier said . all eu members would have to ratify the constitution for it to be valid . the treaty was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu after expansion into eastern europe raised its size to 25 countries , but fears over enlargement , particularly turkey 's bid to join the bloc , were seen as the major reason for the rejection of the constitution . constitutional road map would be a success hopes are high that germany can get europe on track after the french and dutch rejections plunged the bloc into crisis last year . steinmeier , whose spd governs in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , wanted to push down expectations for a breakthrough during germany 's six months with the eu presidency 's gavel , which begin jan .
1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't want expectations too high last week merkel said her government would lay out a " vision " by the end of its presidency to try and unite all sides without watering down the original charter . " i 'm against cherry picking , we must n't just quickly pick out what we think is easiest and leave the rest lying , but tackle things with ambition , " it would be a success for the eu if member states could reach agreement on a blueprint calling for continued work on the treaty . " there will not be a final result at the end of the german presidency , but rather , if things go well , there will be a decision to continue work for a constitution that is connected to a decision about model and schedule , " he said . steinmeier 's colleague and spd party head kurt beck agreed , saying " natural and cultural sensitivities -lrb- as seen in holland and france 's rejection of the constitution -rrb- could be added into a preamble in the eu constitution . " " our goal is nevertheless ambitious , " beck said .
" we do n't need any compromises on formula but rather a solution that makes europe able to work and fit for the future . " steinmeier said germany 's task would be to serve as a mediator in getting a road map on track .
he said germany should listen to eu members ' views and hold off on making its own suggestions until the end of the presidency . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .
" we 're envisaging an integrated security mechanism that incorporates all vehicles on the track , including maintenance cars .
we 'll have a more sophisticated safety system in place . " mixed feelings for transrapid in china fortunately for the transrapid operators , most passengers in shanghai are putting last week 's accident in germany down to human error and are not afraid of an accident of this kind happening with the transrapid trains in commercial use . " i ' sure that the accident in germany will have no impact on the future of the transrapid here in china , " said one passenger .
" after all , we 're not talking about any technical failure of the high speed train itself .
i 'm in favor of building more such transrapid tracks in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's maglev caught fire in august however , the shanghai line has not been without its own problems .
on aug.11 , the train heading to the city 's main international airport caught fire after a fault in an electrical storage compartment beneath the passenger cabin .
the fire generated large amounts of smoke , but there were no deaths or injuries . operational costs for the transrapid have also been found to be extremely high .
the operation in shanghai , for which germany provided 10 percent of the $ 1 billion -lrb- 783 million euros -rrb- budget , is still running at a deficit with no real turnaround in sight . despite lending cachet to shanghai 's ambitions of becoming a center for regional business , the train has largely been a commercial failure , according to most economic observers . cut-price fares have recently been introduced to attract more customers after passengers complained that they had to travel far from downtown shanghai to board the train and that its tickets were too expensive .
the system 's operator , shanghai maglev transport development co . , had already slashed the ticket prices by one-third soon after its opening due to a drop in demand . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans discuss future of train technology after crash germany 's transport minister met with experts sunday to discuss the ramifications of a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people friday .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .

welcome to the potential age of voting booths in pubs . there have been some inspired projects in history : junior sword-swallowing kits and amateur bear wrestling to name but a single pair .
however , not many can come close to the city of bremen 's idea of allowing polling booths to be set up in bars . with a local election on the horizon , the city 's authorities are hoping to increase voter numbers by making the possibility of casting votes ever easier . after recognizing the similarities between pulling a draught beer and pulling an election lever they 're considering bringing polling booths to the places errant citizens tend to hide to escape the drudgery of politics - the local drinking hole . imagine the scene : a citizen of bremen has adjourned to a local hostelry to escape the incessant loudspeakers in the streets , grotesque party placards of grinning candidates and reams of wasteful propaganda forced upon him as he attempts to keep democracy from infringing on his drinking time . drinkers to become politicians ' prey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're a real friend , you are ... i 'm voting for you ... "
up pops candidate a by the citizen 's side in the bar .
" why the long face ? " says candidate a.
" i hate elections , " says the citizen .
" tell me about it , " says candidate a and motions to the barkeeper to refresh the citizen 's drink . a sorry tale of dashed hopes , a country going to the dogs and several beers later and candidate a is suddenly the citizen 's best friend .
" let 's teach those politicians a lesson , " says candidate a and leads the citizen to the polling booth in the corner by the jukebox .
you can guess what happens next . while voting for the candidate that buys you the most beer may be one of the consequences , others clearly include the fact that rational decisions are rarely made under the influence of alcohol and the fact that politicians may start hanging out in bars more often than they already do , leading to the question : who 's running the country ?
either no one or a bunch of drunks . christian weber of the bremen social democratic party told monday 's süddeutsche zeitung that elections needed an image makeover . " we want to give elections more of an event feel , " he said as he revealed that the city was also considering putting polling booths in petrol stations and shopping areas .
presumably drivers getting away from it all will be targeted as they refuel and mother 's wrestling with screaming toddlers will vote for whoever just to get on with the chore at hand . such an idea is certainly well worth a " democracy in action " award . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor spotted down at the pub in wales it has emerged in news reports that newly ex-chancellor gerhard schröder is busy working on his english in a remote part of wales - and enjoying a pint or two at the local pub .

" i should like to reiterate all the esteem and the profound respect that i have for muslim believers , " the pontiff told the ambassadors and charge d 'affaires he invited to his summer residence south of rome . his audience included envoys from iran , turkey and morocco and was the latest step in a diplomatic offensive by the vatican aimed at mollifying muslim anger over recent comments by the pope . " in a world marked by relativism and too often excluding the transcendence and universality of reason , we are in great need of an authentic dialogue between religions and between cultures , capable of assisting us , in a spirit of fruitful co-operation , to overcome all the tensions together , " the pope said . in a speech on sept .
12 while visiting his native germany , benedict quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " " i am profoundly convinced that in the current world situation it is imperative that christians and muslims engage with one another in order to address the numerous challenges that present themselves to humanity , " the pope said . " christians and muslims must learn to work together ... in order to guard against all forms of intolerance and to oppose all manifestations of violence , " he added . trying to " build bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's meeting with muslims monday took less than a half hour the meeting at castel gandolfo , which had been heavily promoted by the vatican as a major step in reaffirming the pope 's commitment to inter-religious harmony , lasted barely 30 minutes . after his address , the pope shook hands and exchanged a few words with the assembled envoys , some of whom expressed satisfaction with the meeting . " i think it is time to put what happened behind us and build bridges among all the civilizations , " said iraqi ambassador albert yelda , who nevertheless defended the anger that had surfaced over the pope 's comments earlier this month . " many muslims around the world were offended , " yelda said .
" they expressed their feelings and they were right to do so .
everybody has a right to express his feelings . " a furor erupted in the muslim world following the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in germany , in which he quoted the medieval emperor who equated islam with violence . since then , thousands of muslims in iran , afghanistan and the gaza strip have protested against the pope 's remarks . while insisting that the content of his lecture had been misinterpreted , the pope sought to calm the situation last week , repeatedly saying he was " deeply sorry " for any offence muslims might have taken from his comments . the italian paper la repubblica reported that in the over 2,000-year-old history of the catholic church , a pope has never had to publicly express regret over his statements several times . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?
or are you also i n favor of offeri n g cou n tries like ukrai n e a n d others a cha n ce to joi n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its advances , romania can still do with a bit of modernization , basescu says it is difficult to evaluate when - or whether - the eu should offer the option of membership to ukraine .
what is certain is that before the eu thinks about ukraine , it has to first solve one of the biggest problems .
it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .
before the european union can think about ukraine it has to find a solution to guarantee security of the black sea . mr. preside n t , you 've had a career as a ship 's captai n .
i n our last i n terview - also here i n berli n - i asked you if you were co n fide n t you could steer the roma n ia n ship i n to the port of europe .
now it seems you have succeeded .
are you glad ? i feel we 've reached the next stage .
but the romanian ship will only be safely in port when romania becomes modern . we wish you all the best for that regatta . alexa n der kudascheff i n terviewed traia n basescu -lrb- wi n -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets conditions for bulgarian , romanian memberships eu commission president jose barroso on tuesday presented a list of conditions sofia and bucharest must fulfill so they can attain eu membership by 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 germany optimistic about train technology despite setback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has the only maglev train in commercial use and was looking to expand after a german maglev train crash last week , industry experts are optimistic that the technology remains attractive to investors , especially those who wish to expand the transrapid system in china . while the investigation into the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people in germany on friday continues , experts are trying to assess the implications for further developing the cutting-edge monorail technology . industry leaders and politicians have been trying for decades to build transrapid routes in germany and sell more of the technology abroad .
now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .
" we 're envisaging an integrated security mechanism that incorporates all vehicles on the track , including maintenance cars .
we 'll have a more sophisticated safety system in place . " mixed feelings for transrapid in china fortunately for the transrapid operators , most passengers in shanghai are putting last week 's accident in germany down to human error and are not afraid of an accident of this kind happening with the transrapid trains in commercial use .

" thus , the swiss people 's party will in the future only make an issue of abuse and attempt to torpedo the integration of the foreigners who live here , " the paper continued .
" the other mainstream parties must not let that happen .
for , yesterday the people also clearly said yes to the new law on foreigners that is supposed to improve integration . … if the double yes leads to the center parties relegating the abuse discussion to the past and embracing integration , good will also have come from yesterday 's result .

" two-thirds -lrb- of eu members -rrb- are behind the constitution , " he said .
" i believe everyone should feel an obligation because of that . " if it is to be saved , and we urgently need it , everyone has to move their position .
but some have to move more than others , " he added . without naming other countries , he admitted to having seen encouraging signs out of warsaw and paris . votes for and against bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france was among the countries that voted against the constitution in may , finland 's parliament voted in favor of the constitution , while romania and bulgaria - which are expected to enter the european union in 2007 - will join the 15 who have ratified it for a two-thirds majority , steinmeier said . all eu members would have to ratify the constitution for it to be valid . the treaty was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu after expansion into eastern europe raised its size to 25 countries , but fears over enlargement , particularly turkey 's bid to join the bloc , were seen as the major reason for the rejection of the constitution . constitutional road map would be a success hopes are high that germany can get europe on track after the french and dutch rejections plunged the bloc into crisis last year . steinmeier , whose spd governs in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , wanted to push down expectations for a breakthrough during germany 's six months with the eu presidency 's gavel , which begin jan .

" i 'm against cherry picking , we must n't just quickly pick out what we think is easiest and leave the rest lying , but tackle things with ambition , " it would be a success for the eu if member states could reach agreement on a blueprint calling for continued work on the treaty . " there will not be a final result at the end of the german presidency , but rather , if things go well , there will be a decision to continue work for a constitution that is connected to a decision about model and schedule , " he said . steinmeier 's colleague and spd party head kurt beck agreed , saying " natural and cultural sensitivities -lrb- as seen in holland and france 's rejection of the constitution -rrb- could be added into a preamble in the eu constitution . " " our goal is nevertheless ambitious , " beck said .
" we do n't need any compromises on formula but rather a solution that makes europe able to work and fit for the future . " steinmeier said germany 's task would be to serve as a mediator in getting a road map on track .

1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .

romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .

dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .

and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .

1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an instrument of suppression or harmless clothing of choice ?
the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

" two-thirds -lrb- of eu members -rrb- are behind the constitution , " he said .
" i believe everyone should feel an obligation because of that . " if it is to be saved , and we urgently need it , everyone has to move their position .
but some have to move more than others , " he added . without naming other countries , he admitted to having seen encouraging signs out of warsaw and paris . votes for and against bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france was among the countries that voted against the constitution in may , finland 's parliament voted in favor of the constitution , while romania and bulgaria - which are expected to enter the european union in 2007 - will join the 15 who have ratified it for a two-thirds majority , steinmeier said . all eu members would have to ratify the constitution for it to be valid . the treaty was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu after expansion into eastern europe raised its size to 25 countries , but fears over enlargement , particularly turkey 's bid to join the bloc , were seen as the major reason for the rejection of the constitution . constitutional road map would be a success hopes are high that germany can get europe on track after the french and dutch rejections plunged the bloc into crisis last year . steinmeier , whose spd governs in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , wanted to push down expectations for a breakthrough during germany 's six months with the eu presidency 's gavel , which begin jan .
1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't want expectations too high last week merkel said her government would lay out a " vision " by the end of its presidency to try and unite all sides without watering down the original charter . " i 'm against cherry picking , we must n't just quickly pick out what we think is easiest and leave the rest lying , but tackle things with ambition , " it would be a success for the eu if member states could reach agreement on a blueprint calling for continued work on the treaty . " there will not be a final result at the end of the german presidency , but rather , if things go well , there will be a decision to continue work for a constitution that is connected to a decision about model and schedule , " he said . steinmeier 's colleague and spd party head kurt beck agreed , saying " natural and cultural sensitivities -lrb- as seen in holland and france 's rejection of the constitution -rrb- could be added into a preamble in the eu constitution . " " our goal is nevertheless ambitious , " beck said .
" we do n't need any compromises on formula but rather a solution that makes europe able to work and fit for the future . " steinmeier said germany 's task would be to serve as a mediator in getting a road map on track .

" the planning was okay because the experiences we gained from the cologne youth day , " he said .
" we learned to respond to large amounts of people moving quickly and suddenly .

" i should like to reiterate all the esteem and the profound respect that i have for muslim believers , " the pontiff told the ambassadors and charge d 'affaires he invited to his summer residence south of rome . his audience included envoys from iran , turkey and morocco and was the latest step in a diplomatic offensive by the vatican aimed at mollifying muslim anger over recent comments by the pope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.09.2006 bremen considers the wisdom of voting in bars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you bet i need a drink with candidates like those guys it is illegal to drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol but determining the fate of a city or even a country is another thing .
welcome to the potential age of voting booths in pubs . there have been some inspired projects in history : junior sword-swallowing kits and amateur bear wrestling to name but a single pair .
however , not many can come close to the city of bremen 's idea of allowing polling booths to be set up in bars . with a local election on the horizon , the city 's authorities are hoping to increase voter numbers by making the possibility of casting votes ever easier . after recognizing the similarities between pulling a draught beer and pulling an election lever they 're considering bringing polling booths to the places errant citizens tend to hide to escape the drudgery of politics - the local drinking hole . imagine the scene : a citizen of bremen has adjourned to a local hostelry to escape the incessant loudspeakers in the streets , grotesque party placards of grinning candidates and reams of wasteful propaganda forced upon him as he attempts to keep democracy from infringing on his drinking time . drinkers to become politicians ' prey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're a real friend , you are ... i 'm voting for you ... "
up pops candidate a by the citizen 's side in the bar .
" why the long face ? " says candidate a.
" i hate elections , " says the citizen .
" tell me about it , " says candidate a and motions to the barkeeper to refresh the citizen 's drink . a sorry tale of dashed hopes , a country going to the dogs and several beers later and candidate a is suddenly the citizen 's best friend .
" let 's teach those politicians a lesson , " says candidate a and leads the citizen to the polling booth in the corner by the jukebox .
you can guess what happens next . while voting for the candidate that buys you the most beer may be one of the consequences , others clearly include the fact that rational decisions are rarely made under the influence of alcohol and the fact that politicians may start hanging out in bars more often than they already do , leading to the question : who 's running the country ?
either no one or a bunch of drunks . christian weber of the bremen social democratic party told monday 's süddeutsche zeitung that elections needed an image makeover . " we want to give elections more of an event feel , " he said as he revealed that the city was also considering putting polling booths in petrol stations and shopping areas .
presumably drivers getting away from it all will be targeted as they refuel and mother 's wrestling with screaming toddlers will vote for whoever just to get on with the chore at hand . such an idea is certainly well worth a " democracy in action " award . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor spotted down at the pub in wales it has emerged in news reports that newly ex-chancellor gerhard schröder is busy working on his english in a remote part of wales - and enjoying a pint or two at the local pub .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .

about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

" i 'm against cherry picking , we must n't just quickly pick out what we think is easiest and leave the rest lying , but tackle things with ambition , " it would be a success for the eu if member states could reach agreement on a blueprint calling for continued work on the treaty . " there will not be a final result at the end of the german presidency , but rather , if things go well , there will be a decision to continue work for a constitution that is connected to a decision about model and schedule , " he said . steinmeier 's colleague and spd party head kurt beck agreed , saying " natural and cultural sensitivities -lrb- as seen in holland and france 's rejection of the constitution -rrb- could be added into a preamble in the eu constitution . " " our goal is nevertheless ambitious , " beck said .
" we do n't need any compromises on formula but rather a solution that makes europe able to work and fit for the future . " steinmeier said germany 's task would be to serve as a mediator in getting a road map on track .

what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .

in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?

it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .

dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .

you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 germany optimistic about train technology despite setback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has the only maglev train in commercial use and was looking to expand after a german maglev train crash last week , industry experts are optimistic that the technology remains attractive to investors , especially those who wish to expand the transrapid system in china . while the investigation into the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people in germany on friday continues , experts are trying to assess the implications for further developing the cutting-edge monorail technology . industry leaders and politicians have been trying for decades to build transrapid routes in germany and sell more of the technology abroad .
now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .
" we 're envisaging an integrated security mechanism that incorporates all vehicles on the track , including maintenance cars .
we 'll have a more sophisticated safety system in place . " mixed feelings for transrapid in china fortunately for the transrapid operators , most passengers in shanghai are putting last week 's accident in germany down to human error and are not afraid of an accident of this kind happening with the transrapid trains in commercial use . " i ' sure that the accident in germany will have no impact on the future of the transrapid here in china , " said one passenger .
" after all , we 're not talking about any technical failure of the high speed train itself .
i 'm in favor of building more such transrapid tracks in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's maglev caught fire in august however , the shanghai line has not been without its own problems .
on aug.11 , the train heading to the city 's main international airport caught fire after a fault in an electrical storage compartment beneath the passenger cabin .
the fire generated large amounts of smoke , but there were no deaths or injuries . operational costs for the transrapid have also been found to be extremely high .
the operation in shanghai , for which germany provided 10 percent of the $ 1 billion -lrb- 783 million euros -rrb- budget , is still running at a deficit with no real turnaround in sight . despite lending cachet to shanghai 's ambitions of becoming a center for regional business , the train has largely been a commercial failure , according to most economic observers . cut-price fares have recently been introduced to attract more customers after passengers complained that they had to travel far from downtown shanghai to board the train and that its tickets were too expensive .
the system 's operator , shanghai maglev transport development co . , had already slashed the ticket prices by one-third soon after its opening due to a drop in demand . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans discuss future of train technology after crash germany 's transport minister met with experts sunday to discuss the ramifications of a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people friday .
china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology .

now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .
" we 're envisaging an integrated security mechanism that incorporates all vehicles on the track , including maintenance cars .
we 'll have a more sophisticated safety system in place . " mixed feelings for transrapid in china fortunately for the transrapid operators , most passengers in shanghai are putting last week 's accident in germany down to human error and are not afraid of an accident of this kind happening with the transrapid trains in commercial use . " i ' sure that the accident in germany will have no impact on the future of the transrapid here in china , " said one passenger .
" after all , we 're not talking about any technical failure of the high speed train itself .
i 'm in favor of building more such transrapid tracks in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's maglev caught fire in august however , the shanghai line has not been without its own problems .
on aug.11 , the train heading to the city 's main international airport caught fire after a fault in an electrical storage compartment beneath the passenger cabin .
the fire generated large amounts of smoke , but there were no deaths or injuries . operational costs for the transrapid have also been found to be extremely high .
the operation in shanghai , for which germany provided 10 percent of the $ 1 billion -lrb- 783 million euros -rrb- budget , is still running at a deficit with no real turnaround in sight . despite lending cachet to shanghai 's ambitions of becoming a center for regional business , the train has largely been a commercial failure , according to most economic observers . cut-price fares have recently been introduced to attract more customers after passengers complained that they had to travel far from downtown shanghai to board the train and that its tickets were too expensive .
the system 's operator , shanghai maglev transport development co . , had already slashed the ticket prices by one-third soon after its opening due to a drop in demand . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans discuss future of train technology after crash germany 's transport minister met with experts sunday to discuss the ramifications of a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people friday .

" like its neighbors , the small but wealthy country has made its borders tighter , " commented freiburg 's badische zeitung newspaper , from just over the border .
" however , if one looks closely , the law also includes improvements for asylum seekers and immigrants .
for example , rejected asylum seekers who for humanitarian reasons will not be deported are to receive a work permit .
a provision for hardship cases also entitles them to a residence permit if they have been successfully integrated .
this double strategy unexpectedly brought the right-wing populist -lrb- justice minister christoph -rrb- blocher great acclamation .
everyday practice will show which of the two sides of the new law will have the stronger effect . " " is the blocherization of switzerland now a threat ?
asked the südkurier , another german daily working from near the border , in constance .
" the -lrb- voters ' -rrb- decision is certainly problematic , but due to the entirely different democratic system , a shift to the right ca n't be read from it .
referendums in the confederation are always snapshots .
in contrast to 1992 , this time the right managed to put the issue of asylum abuse in the forefront .
thus , voters who think little of blocher also said yes .
every nation certainly has the right to enact clear regulations so that legislation regarding guests is n't taken advantage of .
nevertheless , there is unease .
among every stream of refugees there are persecuted people who must be helped without bureaucracy .
switzerland is battening down the hatches against them too - confident that others will come to their assistance .
the germans , for example . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in italy : switzerland plans to rely on its neighbors to avoid accepting refugees " amnesty international and the un refugee organization have reacted to the tightening of the asylum and foreigner legislation with criticism , " wrote spanish daily el mundo .
" the new regulation , among other things , allows illegal immigrants who show up in switzerland to be arrested .
the result of the referendum is understandable , however , if one takes into account that every fifth inhabitant of switzerland is of foreign origin .
thus , the proportion of foreigners is far higher than the average in the european union .
there is , as one minister put it , not room for everyone there . " " europe is so coveted among refugees as well as by migrants , because it is europe : because of its prosperity , but also its code of values - which are closely tied , " commented austria 's der standard newspaper .
" at the same time , europe is still far from finding a common answer to the asylum and migration problem .
that was demonstrated again just recently at the meeting of eu interior and justice ministers in tampere .
attempts to dismantle the principle of unanimity and to come to a common asylum and immigration policy through majority decisions still fail due to broad resistance .
many countries do n't want to cede sovereign rights , because they believe they will cope with the problems better irregardless of other states . " " such overwhelming majorities for the legislation on foreigners and especially for the revision of asylum law were not expected , " the neue zürcher zeitung pointed out .
" and , in as far as votes on migration policies are n't only about concrete contents but also about general attitudes to foreigners , the massive double yes ca n't leave liberal supporters pleased .
if the approval of tightening asylum law expresses more than concerns about administrative difficulties with a couple thousand rejected applicants without travel documents , it opens up a broad field for interpretation .
crime , the loss of economic and cultural certainties or islam as a bogeyman are common keywords in explanation attempts .
but more precise analyses and conclusions are tasks for more than just the day of the referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocher and his party got their way " there can be no argument about it : a good two-thirds of the voters said yes to the new asylum law , " wrote zurich 's tages-anzeiger .
" the discontent is too great about foreigners who deceive the authorities to get admission to switzerland , the paradise of prosperity .
the abuse dominated the discussion - the opponents failed to lead it in other directions and experienced a crushing defeat . … the clear result will namely give a boost to those powers within the -lrb- blocher 's -rrb- swiss people 's party , who want to take advantage of the still diffuse fears of the foreign in order to reap election successes .
" thus , the swiss people 's party will in the future only make an issue of abuse and attempt to torpedo the integration of the foreigners who live here , " the paper continued .
" the other mainstream parties must not let that happen .
for , yesterday the people also clearly said yes to the new law on foreigners that is supposed to improve integration . … if the double yes leads to the center parties relegating the abuse discussion to the past and embracing integration , good will also have come from yesterday 's result .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.09.2006 high hopes for transrapid 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accidents are part of testing future technologies , some readers say dw-world.de 's readers expressed the hope that the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people on friday would not spell the end for the transrapid project . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this is certainly a serious blow to maglev , but hopefully german officials will get to the heart of what caused the tragedy .
their will be attempts to stop maglev , but if handled openly and correctly , it will go on and grow and be better for the experience .
every new technology has its first-use tragedies , i.e. , the airplane , the rocket , the space shuttle , even the automobile . - georg kniss , usa the transrapid project should not be abandoned because of the untypical absence of a failsafe mechanism / technology . - william wirthmann i 'm sorry to hear about the crash of the transrapid and express my sympathy to the victims and their families .
but considering the human error angle of the crash and the relatively accident-free operation over the > 20 years they have been testing it and the operation in shanghai , the casualty number is relatively low and the survival rate -lrb- ~ 30 percent -rrb- relatively high , comparing the incident to airplane , car / bus and conventional railway crashes . - best of all : there was no fire -lrb- because there is no fuel on board -rrb- .
this looks like a typical screw-up , just like the only two accidents of the wuppertaler schwebebahn were .
the service car was on the transrapid track by stupid negligence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an instrument of suppression or harmless clothing of choice ?
the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 germany optimistic about train technology despite setback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has the only maglev train in commercial use and was looking to expand after a german maglev train crash last week , industry experts are optimistic that the technology remains attractive to investors , especially those who wish to expand the transrapid system in china . while the investigation into the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people in germany on friday continues , experts are trying to assess the implications for further developing the cutting-edge monorail technology . industry leaders and politicians have been trying for decades to build transrapid routes in germany and sell more of the technology abroad .
now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .
" we 're envisaging an integrated security mechanism that incorporates all vehicles on the track , including maintenance cars .
we 'll have a more sophisticated safety system in place . " mixed feelings for transrapid in china fortunately for the transrapid operators , most passengers in shanghai are putting last week 's accident in germany down to human error and are not afraid of an accident of this kind happening with the transrapid trains in commercial use . " i ' sure that the accident in germany will have no impact on the future of the transrapid here in china , " said one passenger .
" after all , we 're not talking about any technical failure of the high speed train itself .
i 'm in favor of building more such transrapid tracks in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's maglev caught fire in august however , the shanghai line has not been without its own problems .
on aug.11 , the train heading to the city 's main international airport caught fire after a fault in an electrical storage compartment beneath the passenger cabin .
the fire generated large amounts of smoke , but there were no deaths or injuries . operational costs for the transrapid have also been found to be extremely high .
the operation in shanghai , for which germany provided 10 percent of the $ 1 billion -lrb- 783 million euros -rrb- budget , is still running at a deficit with no real turnaround in sight . despite lending cachet to shanghai 's ambitions of becoming a center for regional business , the train has largely been a commercial failure , according to most economic observers . cut-price fares have recently been introduced to attract more customers after passengers complained that they had to travel far from downtown shanghai to board the train and that its tickets were too expensive .
the system 's operator , shanghai maglev transport development co . , had already slashed the ticket prices by one-third soon after its opening due to a drop in demand . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans discuss future of train technology after crash germany 's transport minister met with experts sunday to discuss the ramifications of a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people friday .
china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.09.2006 " we have fulfilled all obligations " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basescu was elected as romanian president in december 2004 on tuesday , the eu will say whether romania and bulgaria are ready to join the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?

what is certain is that before the eu thinks about ukraine , it has to first solve one of the biggest problems .
it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .
before the european union can think about ukraine it has to find a solution to guarantee security of the black sea . mr. preside n t , you 've had a career as a ship 's captai n .
i n our last i n terview - also here i n berli n - i asked you if you were co n fide n t you could steer the roma n ia n ship i n to the port of europe .
now it seems you have succeeded .
are you glad ? i feel we 've reached the next stage .

" two-thirds -lrb- of eu members -rrb- are behind the constitution , " he said .
" i believe everyone should feel an obligation because of that . " if it is to be saved , and we urgently need it , everyone has to move their position .
but some have to move more than others , " he added . without naming other countries , he admitted to having seen encouraging signs out of warsaw and paris . votes for and against bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france was among the countries that voted against the constitution in may , finland 's parliament voted in favor of the constitution , while romania and bulgaria - which are expected to enter the european union in 2007 - will join the 15 who have ratified it for a two-thirds majority , steinmeier said . all eu members would have to ratify the constitution for it to be valid . the treaty was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu after expansion into eastern europe raised its size to 25 countries , but fears over enlargement , particularly turkey 's bid to join the bloc , were seen as the major reason for the rejection of the constitution . constitutional road map would be a success hopes are high that germany can get europe on track after the french and dutch rejections plunged the bloc into crisis last year . steinmeier , whose spd governs in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , wanted to push down expectations for a breakthrough during germany 's six months with the eu presidency 's gavel , which begin jan .
1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't want expectations too high last week merkel said her government would lay out a " vision " by the end of its presidency to try and unite all sides without watering down the original charter . " i 'm against cherry picking , we must n't just quickly pick out what we think is easiest and leave the rest lying , but tackle things with ambition , " it would be a success for the eu if member states could reach agreement on a blueprint calling for continued work on the treaty . " there will not be a final result at the end of the german presidency , but rather , if things go well , there will be a decision to continue work for a constitution that is connected to a decision about model and schedule , " he said . steinmeier 's colleague and spd party head kurt beck agreed , saying " natural and cultural sensitivities -lrb- as seen in holland and france 's rejection of the constitution -rrb- could be added into a preamble in the eu constitution . " " our goal is nevertheless ambitious , " beck said .
" we do n't need any compromises on formula but rather a solution that makes europe able to work and fit for the future . " steinmeier said germany 's task would be to serve as a mediator in getting a road map on track .
he said germany should listen to eu members ' views and hold off on making its own suggestions until the end of the presidency . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .
" we 're envisaging an integrated security mechanism that incorporates all vehicles on the track , including maintenance cars .
we 'll have a more sophisticated safety system in place . " mixed feelings for transrapid in china fortunately for the transrapid operators , most passengers in shanghai are putting last week 's accident in germany down to human error and are not afraid of an accident of this kind happening with the transrapid trains in commercial use . " i ' sure that the accident in germany will have no impact on the future of the transrapid here in china , " said one passenger .
" after all , we 're not talking about any technical failure of the high speed train itself .
i 'm in favor of building more such transrapid tracks in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's maglev caught fire in august however , the shanghai line has not been without its own problems .
on aug.11 , the train heading to the city 's main international airport caught fire after a fault in an electrical storage compartment beneath the passenger cabin .
the fire generated large amounts of smoke , but there were no deaths or injuries . operational costs for the transrapid have also been found to be extremely high .
the operation in shanghai , for which germany provided 10 percent of the $ 1 billion -lrb- 783 million euros -rrb- budget , is still running at a deficit with no real turnaround in sight . despite lending cachet to shanghai 's ambitions of becoming a center for regional business , the train has largely been a commercial failure , according to most economic observers . cut-price fares have recently been introduced to attract more customers after passengers complained that they had to travel far from downtown shanghai to board the train and that its tickets were too expensive .
the system 's operator , shanghai maglev transport development co . , had already slashed the ticket prices by one-third soon after its opening due to a drop in demand . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans discuss future of train technology after crash germany 's transport minister met with experts sunday to discuss the ramifications of a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people friday .

1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?

what is certain is that before the eu thinks about ukraine , it has to first solve one of the biggest problems .
it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .
before the european union can think about ukraine it has to find a solution to guarantee security of the black sea . mr. preside n t , you 've had a career as a ship 's captai n .
i n our last i n terview - also here i n berli n - i asked you if you were co n fide n t you could steer the roma n ia n ship i n to the port of europe .
now it seems you have succeeded .
are you glad ? i feel we 've reached the next stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an instrument of suppression or harmless clothing of choice ?
the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

" two-thirds -lrb- of eu members -rrb- are behind the constitution , " he said .
" i believe everyone should feel an obligation because of that . " if it is to be saved , and we urgently need it , everyone has to move their position .
but some have to move more than others , " he added . without naming other countries , he admitted to having seen encouraging signs out of warsaw and paris . votes for and against bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france was among the countries that voted against the constitution in may , finland 's parliament voted in favor of the constitution , while romania and bulgaria - which are expected to enter the european union in 2007 - will join the 15 who have ratified it for a two-thirds majority , steinmeier said . all eu members would have to ratify the constitution for it to be valid . the treaty was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu after expansion into eastern europe raised its size to 25 countries , but fears over enlargement , particularly turkey 's bid to join the bloc , were seen as the major reason for the rejection of the constitution . constitutional road map would be a success hopes are high that germany can get europe on track after the french and dutch rejections plunged the bloc into crisis last year . steinmeier , whose spd governs in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , wanted to push down expectations for a breakthrough during germany 's six months with the eu presidency 's gavel , which begin jan .

" i 'm against cherry picking , we must n't just quickly pick out what we think is easiest and leave the rest lying , but tackle things with ambition , " it would be a success for the eu if member states could reach agreement on a blueprint calling for continued work on the treaty . " there will not be a final result at the end of the german presidency , but rather , if things go well , there will be a decision to continue work for a constitution that is connected to a decision about model and schedule , " he said . steinmeier 's colleague and spd party head kurt beck agreed , saying " natural and cultural sensitivities -lrb- as seen in holland and france 's rejection of the constitution -rrb- could be added into a preamble in the eu constitution . " " our goal is nevertheless ambitious , " beck said .
" we do n't need any compromises on formula but rather a solution that makes europe able to work and fit for the future . " steinmeier said germany 's task would be to serve as a mediator in getting a road map on track .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.09.2006 high hopes for transrapid 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accidents are part of testing future technologies , some readers say dw-world.de 's readers expressed the hope that the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people on friday would not spell the end for the transrapid project . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this is certainly a serious blow to maglev , but hopefully german officials will get to the heart of what caused the tragedy .
their will be attempts to stop maglev , but if handled openly and correctly , it will go on and grow and be better for the experience .
every new technology has its first-use tragedies , i.e. , the airplane , the rocket , the space shuttle , even the automobile . - georg kniss , usa the transrapid project should not be abandoned because of the untypical absence of a failsafe mechanism / technology . - william wirthmann i 'm sorry to hear about the crash of the transrapid and express my sympathy to the victims and their families .
but considering the human error angle of the crash and the relatively accident-free operation over the > 20 years they have been testing it and the operation in shanghai , the casualty number is relatively low and the survival rate -lrb- ~ 30 percent -rrb- relatively high , comparing the incident to airplane , car / bus and conventional railway crashes . - best of all : there was no fire -lrb- because there is no fuel on board -rrb- .
this looks like a typical screw-up , just like the only two accidents of the wuppertaler schwebebahn were .
the service car was on the transrapid track by stupid negligence .
another detail that probably contributed to the casualty number : in the shots of transrapid interiors i could not detect seat belts .
one can not offer any new cars without them , every airplane has them .
the interior safety standards of the transrapid should be at least as good as the tüv and most other safety control bodies worldwide require for cars : seatbelts and airbags .
another well-known safety enhancement : all seats should face backwards !
anything less is criminal negligence .
too bad that now it 's going to be even less likely that we will see a transrapid line in germany , but you can bet there will be many in asia .
the chinese are already talking about one from beijing to singapore via bangkok and kuala lumpur and a possible extension to india , and on to europe .
i 'd love to take the transrapid -lrb- or its chinese copy -rrb- to propel me from my old home town köln to bangkok and shanghai at 500 km / h before i die !
if the trans-siberian railway could be built almost 100 years ago , why not now a trans-eurasian-express ?
airplanes are old tech , airports now are protective detention camps for travelers , with ever-bigger , megalomaniac super-jumbo airplanes serving as paddy wagons .
everybody i know hates to fly .
the new transportation systems have to be clean , fast , frequent , punctual , energy-efficient , environmentally and ethically acceptable , comfortable , low-hassle and humane .
only the maglev principle will make this possible . - dr jerry hess , san diego , ca , usa i love all types of trains , and i think that the transrapid represents the future of high-speed railway .
i hope that siemens will continue the researches in this field despite all difficulties . - doru pop-beg i am very sad regarding this crash with the maglev train .
it is a pity because this " projekt zukunft " is very good for big cities and to link airport to downtown . - rogerio petres , belo horizonte , brazil compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany optimistic about train technology despite setback after a german maglev train crash last week , industry experts are optimistic that the technology remains attractive to investors , especially those who wish to expand the transrapid system in china .
-lrb- 25.09.2006 -rrb- germans discuss future of train technology after crash germany 's transport minister met with experts sunday to discuss the ramifications of a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people friday .
china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology .
-lrb- 24.09.2006 -rrb- germany mulls consequences of transrapid crash as german officials were trying to figure out what caused the tranrapid train crash that killed 23 on friday , the state premier of lower saxony said lack of a failsafe system was reponsible for the disaster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an instrument of suppression or harmless clothing of choice ?
the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .

dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?

what is certain is that before the eu thinks about ukraine , it has to first solve one of the biggest problems .
it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .
before the european union can think about ukraine it has to find a solution to guarantee security of the black sea . mr. preside n t , you 've had a career as a ship 's captai n .

1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?
or are you also i n favor of offeri n g cou n tries like ukrai n e a n d others a cha n ce to joi n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its advances , romania can still do with a bit of modernization , basescu says it is difficult to evaluate when - or whether - the eu should offer the option of membership to ukraine .
what is certain is that before the eu thinks about ukraine , it has to first solve one of the biggest problems .
it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .
before the european union can think about ukraine it has to find a solution to guarantee security of the black sea . mr. preside n t , you 've had a career as a ship 's captai n .
i n our last i n terview - also here i n berli n - i asked you if you were co n fide n t you could steer the roma n ia n ship i n to the port of europe .
now it seems you have succeeded .
are you glad ? i feel we 've reached the next stage .
but the romanian ship will only be safely in port when romania becomes modern . we wish you all the best for that regatta . alexa n der kudascheff i n terviewed traia n basescu -lrb- wi n -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets conditions for bulgarian , romanian memberships eu commission president jose barroso on tuesday presented a list of conditions sofia and bucharest must fulfill so they can attain eu membership by 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.09.2006 high hopes for transrapid 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accidents are part of testing future technologies , some readers say dw-world.de 's readers expressed the hope that the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people on friday would not spell the end for the transrapid project . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this is certainly a serious blow to maglev , but hopefully german officials will get to the heart of what caused the tragedy .
their will be attempts to stop maglev , but if handled openly and correctly , it will go on and grow and be better for the experience .
every new technology has its first-use tragedies , i.e. , the airplane , the rocket , the space shuttle , even the automobile . - georg kniss , usa the transrapid project should not be abandoned because of the untypical absence of a failsafe mechanism / technology . - william wirthmann i 'm sorry to hear about the crash of the transrapid and express my sympathy to the victims and their families .
but considering the human error angle of the crash and the relatively accident-free operation over the > 20 years they have been testing it and the operation in shanghai , the casualty number is relatively low and the survival rate -lrb- ~ 30 percent -rrb- relatively high , comparing the incident to airplane , car / bus and conventional railway crashes . - best of all : there was no fire -lrb- because there is no fuel on board -rrb- .
this looks like a typical screw-up , just like the only two accidents of the wuppertaler schwebebahn were .
the service car was on the transrapid track by stupid negligence .
another detail that probably contributed to the casualty number : in the shots of transrapid interiors i could not detect seat belts .
one can not offer any new cars without them , every airplane has them .
the interior safety standards of the transrapid should be at least as good as the tüv and most other safety control bodies worldwide require for cars : seatbelts and airbags .
another well-known safety enhancement : all seats should face backwards !
anything less is criminal negligence .
too bad that now it 's going to be even less likely that we will see a transrapid line in germany , but you can bet there will be many in asia .
the chinese are already talking about one from beijing to singapore via bangkok and kuala lumpur and a possible extension to india , and on to europe .
i 'd love to take the transrapid -lrb- or its chinese copy -rrb- to propel me from my old home town köln to bangkok and shanghai at 500 km / h before i die !
if the trans-siberian railway could be built almost 100 years ago , why not now a trans-eurasian-express ?
airplanes are old tech , airports now are protective detention camps for travelers , with ever-bigger , megalomaniac super-jumbo airplanes serving as paddy wagons .
everybody i know hates to fly .
the new transportation systems have to be clean , fast , frequent , punctual , energy-efficient , environmentally and ethically acceptable , comfortable , low-hassle and humane .
only the maglev principle will make this possible . - dr jerry hess , san diego , ca , usa i love all types of trains , and i think that the transrapid represents the future of high-speed railway .
i hope that siemens will continue the researches in this field despite all difficulties . - doru pop-beg i am very sad regarding this crash with the maglev train .
it is a pity because this " projekt zukunft " is very good for big cities and to link airport to downtown . - rogerio petres , belo horizonte , brazil compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany optimistic about train technology despite setback after a german maglev train crash last week , industry experts are optimistic that the technology remains attractive to investors , especially those who wish to expand the transrapid system in china .
-lrb- 25.09.2006 -rrb- germans discuss future of train technology after crash germany 's transport minister met with experts sunday to discuss the ramifications of a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people friday .
china reportedly is no longer interested in the technology .
-lrb- 24.09.2006 -rrb- germany mulls consequences of transrapid crash as german officials were trying to figure out what caused the tranrapid train crash that killed 23 on friday , the state premier of lower saxony said lack of a failsafe system was reponsible for the disaster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.09.2006 bremen considers the wisdom of voting in bars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you bet i need a drink with candidates like those guys it is illegal to drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol but determining the fate of a city or even a country is another thing .
welcome to the potential age of voting booths in pubs . there have been some inspired projects in history : junior sword-swallowing kits and amateur bear wrestling to name but a single pair .
however , not many can come close to the city of bremen 's idea of allowing polling booths to be set up in bars . with a local election on the horizon , the city 's authorities are hoping to increase voter numbers by making the possibility of casting votes ever easier . after recognizing the similarities between pulling a draught beer and pulling an election lever they 're considering bringing polling booths to the places errant citizens tend to hide to escape the drudgery of politics - the local drinking hole . imagine the scene : a citizen of bremen has adjourned to a local hostelry to escape the incessant loudspeakers in the streets , grotesque party placards of grinning candidates and reams of wasteful propaganda forced upon him as he attempts to keep democracy from infringing on his drinking time . drinkers to become politicians ' prey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're a real friend , you are ... i 'm voting for you ... "
up pops candidate a by the citizen 's side in the bar .
" why the long face ? " says candidate a.
" i hate elections , " says the citizen .
" tell me about it , " says candidate a and motions to the barkeeper to refresh the citizen 's drink . a sorry tale of dashed hopes , a country going to the dogs and several beers later and candidate a is suddenly the citizen 's best friend .
" let 's teach those politicians a lesson , " says candidate a and leads the citizen to the polling booth in the corner by the jukebox .
you can guess what happens next . while voting for the candidate that buys you the most beer may be one of the consequences , others clearly include the fact that rational decisions are rarely made under the influence of alcohol and the fact that politicians may start hanging out in bars more often than they already do , leading to the question : who 's running the country ?
either no one or a bunch of drunks . christian weber of the bremen social democratic party told monday 's süddeutsche zeitung that elections needed an image makeover . " we want to give elections more of an event feel , " he said as he revealed that the city was also considering putting polling booths in petrol stations and shopping areas .
presumably drivers getting away from it all will be targeted as they refuel and mother 's wrestling with screaming toddlers will vote for whoever just to get on with the chore at hand . such an idea is certainly well worth a " democracy in action " award . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor spotted down at the pub in wales it has emerged in news reports that newly ex-chancellor gerhard schröder is busy working on his english in a remote part of wales - and enjoying a pint or two at the local pub .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 germany optimistic about train technology despite setback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has the only maglev train in commercial use and was looking to expand after a german maglev train crash last week , industry experts are optimistic that the technology remains attractive to investors , especially those who wish to expand the transrapid system in china . while the investigation into the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people in germany on friday continues , experts are trying to assess the implications for further developing the cutting-edge monorail technology . industry leaders and politicians have been trying for decades to build transrapid routes in germany and sell more of the technology abroad .
now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .
" we 're envisaging an integrated security mechanism that incorporates all vehicles on the track , including maintenance cars .
we 'll have a more sophisticated safety system in place . " mixed feelings for transrapid in china fortunately for the transrapid operators , most passengers in shanghai are putting last week 's accident in germany down to human error and are not afraid of an accident of this kind happening with the transrapid trains in commercial use . " i ' sure that the accident in germany will have no impact on the future of the transrapid here in china , " said one passenger .
" after all , we 're not talking about any technical failure of the high speed train itself .
i 'm in favor of building more such transrapid tracks in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's maglev caught fire in august however , the shanghai line has not been without its own problems .
on aug.11 , the train heading to the city 's main international airport caught fire after a fault in an electrical storage compartment beneath the passenger cabin .
the fire generated large amounts of smoke , but there were no deaths or injuries . operational costs for the transrapid have also been found to be extremely high .
the operation in shanghai , for which germany provided 10 percent of the $ 1 billion -lrb- 783 million euros -rrb- budget , is still running at a deficit with no real turnaround in sight . despite lending cachet to shanghai 's ambitions of becoming a center for regional business , the train has largely been a commercial failure , according to most economic observers . cut-price fares have recently been introduced to attract more customers after passengers complained that they had to travel far from downtown shanghai to board the train and that its tickets were too expensive .
the system 's operator , shanghai maglev transport development co . , had already slashed the ticket prices by one-third soon after its opening due to a drop in demand . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans discuss future of train technology after crash germany 's transport minister met with experts sunday to discuss the ramifications of a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an instrument of suppression or harmless clothing of choice ?
the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .

" i should like to reiterate all the esteem and the profound respect that i have for muslim believers , " the pontiff told the ambassadors and charge d 'affaires he invited to his summer residence south of rome . his audience included envoys from iran , turkey and morocco and was the latest step in a diplomatic offensive by the vatican aimed at mollifying muslim anger over recent comments by the pope . " in a world marked by relativism and too often excluding the transcendence and universality of reason , we are in great need of an authentic dialogue between religions and between cultures , capable of assisting us , in a spirit of fruitful co-operation , to overcome all the tensions together , " the pope said . in a speech on sept .
12 while visiting his native germany , benedict quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman .

" i think it is time to put what happened behind us and build bridges among all the civilizations , " said iraqi ambassador albert yelda , who nevertheless defended the anger that had surfaced over the pope 's comments earlier this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an instrument of suppression or harmless clothing of choice ?
the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an instrument of suppression or harmless clothing of choice ?
the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 germany optimistic about train technology despite setback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has the only maglev train in commercial use and was looking to expand after a german maglev train crash last week , industry experts are optimistic that the technology remains attractive to investors , especially those who wish to expand the transrapid system in china . while the investigation into the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people in germany on friday continues , experts are trying to assess the implications for further developing the cutting-edge monorail technology . industry leaders and politicians have been trying for decades to build transrapid routes in germany and sell more of the technology abroad .
now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .
" we 're envisaging an integrated security mechanism that incorporates all vehicles on the track , including maintenance cars .
we 'll have a more sophisticated safety system in place . " mixed feelings for transrapid in china fortunately for the transrapid operators , most passengers in shanghai are putting last week 's accident in germany down to human error and are not afraid of an accident of this kind happening with the transrapid trains in commercial use . " i ' sure that the accident in germany will have no impact on the future of the transrapid here in china , " said one passenger .
" after all , we 're not talking about any technical failure of the high speed train itself .
i 'm in favor of building more such transrapid tracks in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's maglev caught fire in august however , the shanghai line has not been without its own problems .
on aug.11 , the train heading to the city 's main international airport caught fire after a fault in an electrical storage compartment beneath the passenger cabin .
the fire generated large amounts of smoke , but there were no deaths or injuries . operational costs for the transrapid have also been found to be extremely high .
the operation in shanghai , for which germany provided 10 percent of the $ 1 billion -lrb- 783 million euros -rrb- budget , is still running at a deficit with no real turnaround in sight . despite lending cachet to shanghai 's ambitions of becoming a center for regional business , the train has largely been a commercial failure , according to most economic observers . cut-price fares have recently been introduced to attract more customers after passengers complained that they had to travel far from downtown shanghai to board the train and that its tickets were too expensive .
the system 's operator , shanghai maglev transport development co . , had already slashed the ticket prices by one-third soon after its opening due to a drop in demand . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans discuss future of train technology after crash germany 's transport minister met with experts sunday to discuss the ramifications of a magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.09.2006 bremen considers the wisdom of voting in bars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you bet i need a drink with candidates like those guys it is illegal to drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol but determining the fate of a city or even a country is another thing .
welcome to the potential age of voting booths in pubs . there have been some inspired projects in history : junior sword-swallowing kits and amateur bear wrestling to name but a single pair .
however , not many can come close to the city of bremen 's idea of allowing polling booths to be set up in bars . with a local election on the horizon , the city 's authorities are hoping to increase voter numbers by making the possibility of casting votes ever easier . after recognizing the similarities between pulling a draught beer and pulling an election lever they 're considering bringing polling booths to the places errant citizens tend to hide to escape the drudgery of politics - the local drinking hole . imagine the scene : a citizen of bremen has adjourned to a local hostelry to escape the incessant loudspeakers in the streets , grotesque party placards of grinning candidates and reams of wasteful propaganda forced upon him as he attempts to keep democracy from infringing on his drinking time . drinkers to become politicians ' prey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're a real friend , you are ... i 'm voting for you ... "
up pops candidate a by the citizen 's side in the bar .
" why the long face ? " says candidate a.
" i hate elections , " says the citizen .
" tell me about it , " says candidate a and motions to the barkeeper to refresh the citizen 's drink . a sorry tale of dashed hopes , a country going to the dogs and several beers later and candidate a is suddenly the citizen 's best friend .
" let 's teach those politicians a lesson , " says candidate a and leads the citizen to the polling booth in the corner by the jukebox .
you can guess what happens next . while voting for the candidate that buys you the most beer may be one of the consequences , others clearly include the fact that rational decisions are rarely made under the influence of alcohol and the fact that politicians may start hanging out in bars more often than they already do , leading to the question : who 's running the country ?

" i should like to reiterate all the esteem and the profound respect that i have for muslim believers , " the pontiff told the ambassadors and charge d 'affaires he invited to his summer residence south of rome . his audience included envoys from iran , turkey and morocco and was the latest step in a diplomatic offensive by the vatican aimed at mollifying muslim anger over recent comments by the pope . " in a world marked by relativism and too often excluding the transcendence and universality of reason , we are in great need of an authentic dialogue between religions and between cultures , capable of assisting us , in a spirit of fruitful co-operation , to overcome all the tensions together , " the pope said . in a speech on sept .
12 while visiting his native germany , benedict quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " " i am profoundly convinced that in the current world situation it is imperative that christians and muslims engage with one another in order to address the numerous challenges that present themselves to humanity , " the pope said . " christians and muslims must learn to work together ... in order to guard against all forms of intolerance and to oppose all manifestations of violence , " he added . trying to " build bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's meeting with muslims monday took less than a half hour the meeting at castel gandolfo , which had been heavily promoted by the vatican as a major step in reaffirming the pope 's commitment to inter-religious harmony , lasted barely 30 minutes . after his address , the pope shook hands and exchanged a few words with the assembled envoys , some of whom expressed satisfaction with the meeting . " i think it is time to put what happened behind us and build bridges among all the civilizations , " said iraqi ambassador albert yelda , who nevertheless defended the anger that had surfaced over the pope 's comments earlier this month . " many muslims around the world were offended , " yelda said .
" they expressed their feelings and they were right to do so .
everybody has a right to express his feelings . " a furor erupted in the muslim world following the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in germany , in which he quoted the medieval emperor who equated islam with violence . since then , thousands of muslims in iran , afghanistan and the gaza strip have protested against the pope 's remarks . while insisting that the content of his lecture had been misinterpreted , the pope sought to calm the situation last week , repeatedly saying he was " deeply sorry " for any offence muslims might have taken from his comments . the italian paper la repubblica reported that in the over 2,000-year-old history of the catholic church , a pope has never had to publicly express regret over his statements several times . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2006 switzerland battens down the hatches against foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 400 opponents of the new law demonstrated in zurich after the referendum swiss voters on sunday approved legislation that would give their country some of the most restrictive legislation on asylum seekers in europe , sparking criticism from papers around europe . " like its neighbors , the small but wealthy country has made its borders tighter , " commented freiburg 's badische zeitung newspaper , from just over the border .
" however , if one looks closely , the law also includes improvements for asylum seekers and immigrants .
for example , rejected asylum seekers who for humanitarian reasons will not be deported are to receive a work permit .
a provision for hardship cases also entitles them to a residence permit if they have been successfully integrated .
this double strategy unexpectedly brought the right-wing populist -lrb- justice minister christoph -rrb- blocher great acclamation .
everyday practice will show which of the two sides of the new law will have the stronger effect . " " is the blocherization of switzerland now a threat ?
asked the südkurier , another german daily working from near the border , in constance .
" the -lrb- voters ' -rrb- decision is certainly problematic , but due to the entirely different democratic system , a shift to the right ca n't be read from it .
referendums in the confederation are always snapshots .

thus , voters who think little of blocher also said yes .
every nation certainly has the right to enact clear regulations so that legislation regarding guests is n't taken advantage of .
nevertheless , there is unease .
among every stream of refugees there are persecuted people who must be helped without bureaucracy .
switzerland is battening down the hatches against them too - confident that others will come to their assistance .
the germans , for example . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in italy : switzerland plans to rely on its neighbors to avoid accepting refugees " amnesty international and the un refugee organization have reacted to the tightening of the asylum and foreigner legislation with criticism , " wrote spanish daily el mundo .
" the new regulation , among other things , allows illegal immigrants who show up in switzerland to be arrested .
the result of the referendum is understandable , however , if one takes into account that every fifth inhabitant of switzerland is of foreign origin .
thus , the proportion of foreigners is far higher than the average in the european union .
there is , as one minister put it , not room for everyone there . " " europe is so coveted among refugees as well as by migrants , because it is europe : because of its prosperity , but also its code of values - which are closely tied , " commented austria 's der standard newspaper .
" at the same time , europe is still far from finding a common answer to the asylum and migration problem .
that was demonstrated again just recently at the meeting of eu interior and justice ministers in tampere .
attempts to dismantle the principle of unanimity and to come to a common asylum and immigration policy through majority decisions still fail due to broad resistance .
many countries do n't want to cede sovereign rights , because they believe they will cope with the problems better irregardless of other states . " " such overwhelming majorities for the legislation on foreigners and especially for the revision of asylum law were not expected , " the neue zürcher zeitung pointed out .
" and , in as far as votes on migration policies are n't only about concrete contents but also about general attitudes to foreigners , the massive double yes ca n't leave liberal supporters pleased .
if the approval of tightening asylum law expresses more than concerns about administrative difficulties with a couple thousand rejected applicants without travel documents , it opens up a broad field for interpretation .
crime , the loss of economic and cultural certainties or islam as a bogeyman are common keywords in explanation attempts .
but more precise analyses and conclusions are tasks for more than just the day of the referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocher and his party got their way " there can be no argument about it : a good two-thirds of the voters said yes to the new asylum law , " wrote zurich 's tages-anzeiger .
" the discontent is too great about foreigners who deceive the authorities to get admission to switzerland , the paradise of prosperity .
the abuse dominated the discussion - the opponents failed to lead it in other directions and experienced a crushing defeat . … the clear result will namely give a boost to those powers within the -lrb- blocher 's -rrb- swiss people 's party , who want to take advantage of the still diffuse fears of the foreign in order to reap election successes .
" thus , the swiss people 's party will in the future only make an issue of abuse and attempt to torpedo the integration of the foreigners who live here , " the paper continued .
" the other mainstream parties must not let that happen .
for , yesterday the people also clearly said yes to the new law on foreigners that is supposed to improve integration . … if the double yes leads to the center parties relegating the abuse discussion to the past and embracing integration , good will also have come from yesterday 's result .

what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?
or are you also i n favor of offeri n g cou n tries like ukrai n e a n d others a cha n ce to joi n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its advances , romania can still do with a bit of modernization , basescu says it is difficult to evaluate when - or whether - the eu should offer the option of membership to ukraine .
what is certain is that before the eu thinks about ukraine , it has to first solve one of the biggest problems .
it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .
before the european union can think about ukraine it has to find a solution to guarantee security of the black sea . mr. preside n t , you 've had a career as a ship 's captai n .
i n our last i n terview - also here i n berli n - i asked you if you were co n fide n t you could steer the roma n ia n ship i n to the port of europe .
now it seems you have succeeded .
are you glad ? i feel we 've reached the next stage .
but the romanian ship will only be safely in port when romania becomes modern . we wish you all the best for that regatta . alexa n der kudascheff i n terviewed traia n basescu -lrb- wi n -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets conditions for bulgarian , romanian memberships eu commission president jose barroso on tuesday presented a list of conditions sofia and bucharest must fulfill so they can attain eu membership by 2007 .

we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?

what is certain is that before the eu thinks about ukraine , it has to first solve one of the biggest problems .
it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .
before the european union can think about ukraine it has to find a solution to guarantee security of the black sea . mr. preside n t , you 've had a career as a ship 's captai n .
i n our last i n terview - also here i n berli n - i asked you if you were co n fide n t you could steer the roma n ia n ship i n to the port of europe .
now it seems you have succeeded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.09.2006 high hopes for transrapid 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accidents are part of testing future technologies , some readers say dw-world.de 's readers expressed the hope that the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people on friday would not spell the end for the transrapid project . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this is certainly a serious blow to maglev , but hopefully german officials will get to the heart of what caused the tragedy .
their will be attempts to stop maglev , but if handled openly and correctly , it will go on and grow and be better for the experience .
every new technology has its first-use tragedies , i.e. , the airplane , the rocket , the space shuttle , even the automobile . - georg kniss , usa the transrapid project should not be abandoned because of the untypical absence of a failsafe mechanism / technology . - william wirthmann i 'm sorry to hear about the crash of the transrapid and express my sympathy to the victims and their families .
but considering the human error angle of the crash and the relatively accident-free operation over the > 20 years they have been testing it and the operation in shanghai , the casualty number is relatively low and the survival rate -lrb- ~ 30 percent -rrb- relatively high , comparing the incident to airplane , car / bus and conventional railway crashes . - best of all : there was no fire -lrb- because there is no fuel on board -rrb- .
this looks like a typical screw-up , just like the only two accidents of the wuppertaler schwebebahn were .
the service car was on the transrapid track by stupid negligence .
another detail that probably contributed to the casualty number : in the shots of transrapid interiors i could not detect seat belts .
one can not offer any new cars without them , every airplane has them .
the interior safety standards of the transrapid should be at least as good as the tüv and most other safety control bodies worldwide require for cars : seatbelts and airbags .
another well-known safety enhancement : all seats should face backwards !
anything less is criminal negligence .
too bad that now it 's going to be even less likely that we will see a transrapid line in germany , but you can bet there will be many in asia .
the chinese are already talking about one from beijing to singapore via bangkok and kuala lumpur and a possible extension to india , and on to europe .
i 'd love to take the transrapid -lrb- or its chinese copy -rrb- to propel me from my old home town köln to bangkok and shanghai at 500 km / h before i die !
if the trans-siberian railway could be built almost 100 years ago , why not now a trans-eurasian-express ?
airplanes are old tech , airports now are protective detention camps for travelers , with ever-bigger , megalomaniac super-jumbo airplanes serving as paddy wagons .
everybody i know hates to fly .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this is certainly a serious blow to maglev , but hopefully german officials will get to the heart of what caused the tragedy .
their will be attempts to stop maglev , but if handled openly and correctly , it will go on and grow and be better for the experience .
every new technology has its first-use tragedies , i.e. , the airplane , the rocket , the space shuttle , even the automobile . - georg kniss , usa the transrapid project should not be abandoned because of the untypical absence of a failsafe mechanism / technology . - william wirthmann i 'm sorry to hear about the crash of the transrapid and express my sympathy to the victims and their families .
but considering the human error angle of the crash and the relatively accident-free operation over the > 20 years they have been testing it and the operation in shanghai , the casualty number is relatively low and the survival rate -lrb- ~ 30 percent -rrb- relatively high , comparing the incident to airplane , car / bus and conventional railway crashes . - best of all : there was no fire -lrb- because there is no fuel on board -rrb- .
this looks like a typical screw-up , just like the only two accidents of the wuppertaler schwebebahn were .
the service car was on the transrapid track by stupid negligence .
another detail that probably contributed to the casualty number : in the shots of transrapid interiors i could not detect seat belts .
one can not offer any new cars without them , every airplane has them .
the interior safety standards of the transrapid should be at least as good as the tüv and most other safety control bodies worldwide require for cars : seatbelts and airbags .
another well-known safety enhancement : all seats should face backwards !
anything less is criminal negligence .
too bad that now it 's going to be even less likely that we will see a transrapid line in germany , but you can bet there will be many in asia .
the chinese are already talking about one from beijing to singapore via bangkok and kuala lumpur and a possible extension to india , and on to europe .
i 'd love to take the transrapid -lrb- or its chinese copy -rrb- to propel me from my old home town köln to bangkok and shanghai at 500 km / h before i die !
if the trans-siberian railway could be built almost 100 years ago , why not now a trans-eurasian-express ?
airplanes are old tech , airports now are protective detention camps for travelers , with ever-bigger , megalomaniac super-jumbo airplanes serving as paddy wagons .
everybody i know hates to fly .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .

1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .

1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .

1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?
or are you also i n favor of offeri n g cou n tries like ukrai n e a n d others a cha n ce to joi n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its advances , romania can still do with a bit of modernization , basescu says it is difficult to evaluate when - or whether - the eu should offer the option of membership to ukraine .
what is certain is that before the eu thinks about ukraine , it has to first solve one of the biggest problems .
it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .
before the european union can think about ukraine it has to find a solution to guarantee security of the black sea . mr. preside n t , you 've had a career as a ship 's captai n .
i n our last i n terview - also here i n berli n - i asked you if you were co n fide n t you could steer the roma n ia n ship i n to the port of europe .
now it seems you have succeeded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2006 study challenges widely-held notions about islamic headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an instrument of suppression or harmless clothing of choice ?
the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .
muslims are now a part of german society .
and that includes headscarf-wearing girls and women .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .

" two-thirds -lrb- of eu members -rrb- are behind the constitution , " he said .
" i believe everyone should feel an obligation because of that . " if it is to be saved , and we urgently need it , everyone has to move their position .
but some have to move more than others , " he added . without naming other countries , he admitted to having seen encouraging signs out of warsaw and paris . votes for and against bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france was among the countries that voted against the constitution in may , finland 's parliament voted in favor of the constitution , while romania and bulgaria - which are expected to enter the european union in 2007 - will join the 15 who have ratified it for a two-thirds majority , steinmeier said . all eu members would have to ratify the constitution for it to be valid . the treaty was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the eu after expansion into eastern europe raised its size to 25 countries , but fears over enlargement , particularly turkey 's bid to join the bloc , were seen as the major reason for the rejection of the constitution . constitutional road map would be a success hopes are high that germany can get europe on track after the french and dutch rejections plunged the bloc into crisis last year . steinmeier , whose spd governs in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , wanted to push down expectations for a breakthrough during germany 's six months with the eu presidency 's gavel , which begin jan .
1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't want expectations too high last week merkel said her government would lay out a " vision " by the end of its presidency to try and unite all sides without watering down the original charter . " i 'm against cherry picking , we must n't just quickly pick out what we think is easiest and leave the rest lying , but tackle things with ambition , " it would be a success for the eu if member states could reach agreement on a blueprint calling for continued work on the treaty . " there will not be a final result at the end of the german presidency , but rather , if things go well , there will be a decision to continue work for a constitution that is connected to a decision about model and schedule , " he said . steinmeier 's colleague and spd party head kurt beck agreed , saying " natural and cultural sensitivities -lrb- as seen in holland and france 's rejection of the constitution -rrb- could be added into a preamble in the eu constitution . " " our goal is nevertheless ambitious , " beck said .
" we do n't need any compromises on formula but rather a solution that makes europe able to work and fit for the future . " steinmeier said germany 's task would be to serve as a mediator in getting a road map on track .
he said germany should listen to eu members ' views and hold off on making its own suggestions until the end of the presidency . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this is certainly a serious blow to maglev , but hopefully german officials will get to the heart of what caused the tragedy .
their will be attempts to stop maglev , but if handled openly and correctly , it will go on and grow and be better for the experience .
every new technology has its first-use tragedies , i.e. , the airplane , the rocket , the space shuttle , even the automobile . - georg kniss , usa the transrapid project should not be abandoned because of the untypical absence of a failsafe mechanism / technology . - william wirthmann i 'm sorry to hear about the crash of the transrapid and express my sympathy to the victims and their families .

i hope that siemens will continue the researches in this field despite all difficulties . - doru pop-beg i am very sad regarding this crash with the maglev train .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this is certainly a serious blow to maglev , but hopefully german officials will get to the heart of what caused the tragedy .
their will be attempts to stop maglev , but if handled openly and correctly , it will go on and grow and be better for the experience .
every new technology has its first-use tragedies , i.e. , the airplane , the rocket , the space shuttle , even the automobile . - georg kniss , usa the transrapid project should not be abandoned because of the untypical absence of a failsafe mechanism / technology . - william wirthmann i 'm sorry to hear about the crash of the transrapid and express my sympathy to the victims and their families .
but considering the human error angle of the crash and the relatively accident-free operation over the > 20 years they have been testing it and the operation in shanghai , the casualty number is relatively low and the survival rate -lrb- ~ 30 percent -rrb- relatively high , comparing the incident to airplane , car / bus and conventional railway crashes . - best of all : there was no fire -lrb- because there is no fuel on board -rrb- .
this looks like a typical screw-up , just like the only two accidents of the wuppertaler schwebebahn were .
the service car was on the transrapid track by stupid negligence .
another detail that probably contributed to the casualty number : in the shots of transrapid interiors i could not detect seat belts .
one can not offer any new cars without them , every airplane has them .
the interior safety standards of the transrapid should be at least as good as the tüv and most other safety control bodies worldwide require for cars : seatbelts and airbags .
another well-known safety enhancement : all seats should face backwards !
anything less is criminal negligence .
too bad that now it 's going to be even less likely that we will see a transrapid line in germany , but you can bet there will be many in asia .
the chinese are already talking about one from beijing to singapore via bangkok and kuala lumpur and a possible extension to india , and on to europe .

1 , 2007 .
dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?
or are you also i n favor of offeri n g cou n tries like ukrai n e a n d others a cha n ce to joi n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its advances , romania can still do with a bit of modernization , basescu says it is difficult to evaluate when - or whether - the eu should offer the option of membership to ukraine .
what is certain is that before the eu thinks about ukraine , it has to first solve one of the biggest problems .
it has to find a solution , which will give a permanent european perspective to the western balkans and the republic of moldova .
before the european union can think about ukraine it has to find a solution to guarantee security of the black sea . mr. preside n t , you 've had a career as a ship 's captai n .
i n our last i n terview - also here i n berli n - i asked you if you were co n fide n t you could steer the roma n ia n ship i n to the port of europe .
now it seems you have succeeded .
are you glad ? i feel we 've reached the next stage .
but the romanian ship will only be safely in port when romania becomes modern . we wish you all the best for that regatta . alexa n der kudascheff i n terviewed traia n basescu -lrb- wi n -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sets conditions for bulgarian , romanian memberships eu commission president jose barroso on tuesday presented a list of conditions sofia and bucharest must fulfill so they can attain eu membership by 2007 .

dw-tv spoke to romanian president traian basescu about the mood in his country and its preparedness to join the eu . dw-tv : mr. preside n t , o n tuesday we will hear from brussels if your cou n try will joi n the europea n u n io n o n ja n .
1 , 2007 .
what sig n als have you had from brussels ? traian basescu : if you want to hear just one opinion : the report will recommend accession for romania on jan .
1 , 2007 .
in any case , it will not recommend postponing accession .
we have fulfilled all the obligations we took on . do you thi n k roma n ia will be subject to certai n co n ditio n s ? no , i do n't think there will be safeguard clauses for certain sectors .
but , based on the previous experiences of the european union with other member states , there will certainly be recommendations to continue monitoring developments in romania .
we are in agreement with that . is your cou n try ready for the eu ? absolutely yes .
i might say we 've been ready for the european union for nearly 65 years - since we were forced out of europe against our will . still , we do hear criticism of some developme n ts i n your cou n try .
for example , the fight agai n st orga n ized crime a n d corruptio n .
is there more to do , or are you succeedi n g n ow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's ready in 2007 - at least according to this sculpture in bucharest romania has demonstrated over the past years that it has undertaken enormous efforts to achieve the quality standards expected of a member-state of the european union .
the developments of the past two years show that there 's an exceptional political will to fight both corruption and organized crime .
we see that in the romanian press as well as in the fact that the romanian people feel that things are changing . mr. preside n t , do you thi n k roma n ia is see n more critically tha n the easter n europea n cou n tries that joi n ed two years ago ? no , not at all .
but for romania it looks as if public opinion in the eu is very touchy about the enlargement process .
we consider the demands that have been made on romania to be justified .
the only thing we could not accept would be discrimination against us .
but that 's not what is happening .
these are simply conditions that have to be met .
and that is good for us . if you will allow me a little joke : all the officials who monitored the entry of the 10 states into the european union in 2004 were later deployed to monitor just two states - namely romania and bulgaria .
so actually for us that meant we 've already had total monitoring . that 's o n e justificatio n for europea n bureaucracy .
mr. preside n t , how pro-europea n is the mood i n your cou n try ? according to a sociological survey , the support among romanians for a united europe is remarkably high .
sixty-eight percent of the romanian population is not only in favor of romania joining the eu , but also supports the constitutional treaty .
the romanians will be the most important supporters of europe . you have had ma n y eco n omic successes i n rece n t years .
what eco n omic be n efits will roma n ia have o n ce it has joi n ed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's capital , bucharest we will have huge advantages .
you know that we are already seeing - for the sixth year in a row - economic growth that is higher than 6 percent .
in the first six months of this year we had a rise in the gross domestic product of 7.4 percent .
and we predict that we will have a growth rate of 7.5 percent by the end of this year .
in addition , there is a considerable influx of capital .
between 2007 and 2013 we will receive 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.7 billion -rrb- from the european union .
we will be adding another 30 billion of our own to that , for example , to develop rural infrastructure , fight environmental pollution , and for the further education for our workers .
i believe that , in terms of its economic and social perspectives and also in terms of its loyalty to europe , romania will be a pleasant surprise for the union . people i n the europea n u n io n fear that ma n y roma n ia n s will go to other eu member cou n tries to work .
do you fear a huge labor drai n from your cou n try i n a si n gle market where workers ca n move freely ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in a romanian car factory no .
in accordance with the agreements that we have already made , romanians who wanted to work in the eu have had this right for several years .
at the moment more than two million romanians are working in eu countries .
romania is about to experience a lack of workers in several sectors of the economy .
at the same time , this looming shortage has led to impressive wage hikes for workers in certain areas in the years 2005 and 2006 .
that means there is no particular incentive for romanians to leave in droves in search of work abroad , as long as wages at home are at a satisfactory level .
i do not think romania 's eu entry will lead to a wave of emigration . do you thi n k that with your cou n try 's accessio n , the likely e n try of bulgaria a n d probably of croatia , eu e n largeme n t will come to a n e n d ?

now they wonder whether all plans for the magnetic levitation train itself must be called into question . the only example of the monorail transrapid train in commercial use is in china , where it whisks passengers from a residential area in shanghai to the city 's pudong airport at speeds of little under 300 km -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- per hour .
china has for years been discussing plans to extend the system to link shanghai with the city of hangzhou . at the weekend , the head of the shanghai transrapid project visited the crash site in germany .
though german media have reported that the chinese are not interested in further involvement in the project , only his official report will reveal whether or not the german transrapid developers , siemens and thyssenkrupp , can still hope for lucrative follow-on contracts in china . thyssenkrupp chairman ekkhard schulz told reporters over the weekend , " i remain convinced that this is a safe form of transport technology . " no technological cause for accident , says minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accident has been put down to human error in lower saxony , the state where the accident took place , economics minister walter hirche was also confident that last week 's accident would only be a temporary setback for the transrapid technology . " naturally , such an accident weighs heavily on any future debate about the transrapid technology , " hirche said .
" but potential buyers will take a thorough look at the causes for this accident and whether it could have been prevented . " " after all , " he continued , " we 've seen 23 years of testing the technology without any major accident before the disaster on the test track .
the ice high-speed train could not be stopped despite the terrible accident in eschede , nor will friday 's accident spell the end of the transrapid . " proposed munich track still likely to proceed the southern german city of munich has also been considering building a transrapid track between its commercial center and airport .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has already held talks with the operators of the test track where the accident happened to assess the possible consequences for munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee believes the munich track will go ahead " industry representatives assured me that such an accident could not have occurred on the planned munich track , " tiefensee said .
" nevertheless , we 'll have an independent expert analyze the details of the accident on the test track and come up with conclusions as to what must be improved when it comes to building the track in munich . " bavaria 's transport minister erwin huber was also maintained that security precautions in munich would be much better than at the test track . " the security concept for the track in munich is on a higher level than that applied on a test track , " he said .
" we 're envisaging an integrated security mechanism that incorporates all vehicles on the track , including maintenance cars .
we 'll have a more sophisticated safety system in place . " mixed feelings for transrapid in china fortunately for the transrapid operators , most passengers in shanghai are putting last week 's accident in germany down to human error and are not afraid of an accident of this kind happening with the transrapid trains in commercial use . " i ' sure that the accident in germany will have no impact on the future of the transrapid here in china , " said one passenger .
" after all , we 're not talking about any technical failure of the high speed train itself .
i 'm in favor of building more such transrapid tracks in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai 's maglev caught fire in august however , the shanghai line has not been without its own problems .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .

the headscarf is widely regarded in german society as a religious or political symbol that stands for the suppression of women or muslim fundamentalism .
a new study dismantles some of the clichés . the familiar thinking regarding the islamic headscarf in germany goes something like this - it 's a symbol of female suppression , a badge of sexual inhibition as well as a protest against western cultural and moral decadence . for those who thought they knew everything there is to why certain muslim women opt to cover their hair , a study published in germany last week is likely to give them some food for thought . called " the headscarf - unveiling of a symbol ? " and conducted by the konrad adenauer foundation , the study polled 135 religious women of turkish origin between the ages of 18 and 40 in various conservative and liberal muslim communities across germany .
the interviews were conducted by bilingual volunteers . " our aim was to gain access to how such women think and find answers to the question of what the headscarf means for the women who wear it , " said christoph kannengiesser , the deputy secretary general of the foundation , which has close links to the conservative christian democratic union political party . far from being suppressed and intimidated some 97 percent of the women polled said they wear the headscarf for religious reasons .
for most , the decision to don a headscarf is personal and one that - contrary to widespread perception - is hardly influenced by the father , brother or husband .
instead , female role models within the family played a larger role in the decision , according to the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarf-wearing muslim women often say they feel discriminated against nine out of 10 women said the headscarf gave them self-confidence - a point that the authors of the study say is " needed " because more than half the women feel discriminated against on account of their headgear at the work place or during a job search .
half of germany 's 16 federal states have already banned the wearing of a headscarf in public buildings and while performing state jobs . however , 85 percent of those polled said they were friends with women who did n't wear headscarves . more importantly , for a society which to a great extent believes the headscarf to be an instrument of suppression and those women who wear it to be uneducated , most of the turkish women said that it was " feeling like a free person " was more important than marriage and home . on questions of financial independence , male partners and children , most of those polled displayed attitudes similar to german women . irrespective of whether they had german citizenship , 90 percent said they are in favor of a democratically elected government . an ambivalent picture however , there were big differences when it came to matters of faith .
some 32 percent said they believed that islam was superior to other religions .
most of the headscarf-wearing women said they did not feel at home in germany .
about 71 percent said they felt more affinity with turkey , while 80 percent said turks in germany are treated like second-class citizens . the authors of the study stress that on account of the low number of women surveyed and the fact that almost half of them had at least a high school diploma , the report is not representative and highly subjective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study offers an ambivalent picture of muslims in germany the study , however , remains the most comprehensive to date .
it also finds no proof for the widely-held view that the headscarf stands for patriarchal suppression or domination or for muslim fundamentalism .
the authors point out that the majority of those surveyed were convinced of the equality of the sexes . kannengiesser said the study offered a slightly ambivalent picture . " there 's a surprising similarity between the attitudes of headscarf-wearing women and the majority of the population , " he said .
" but there 's a series of revelations , where you do have to say that it 's given us something to think about .
the latter shows that it 's necessary to initiate an intensive dialogue because those are attitudes that are n't conducive for integration . " study underlines need for better integration at the same time , the authors point out that the study demonstrates that the integration of foreigners , particularly germany 's 3.2-million strong muslim population needs to be improved . " it 's clear that we ca n't allow such women or other groups to be isolated in germany , " kannengiesser said .
" this is a call for german society and also an appeal to the group surveyed here to be more open to integration .

" i should like to reiterate all the esteem and the profound respect that i have for muslim believers , " the pontiff told the ambassadors and charge d 'affaires he invited to his summer residence south of rome . his audience included envoys from iran , turkey and morocco and was the latest step in a diplomatic offensive by the vatican aimed at mollifying muslim anger over recent comments by the pope . " in a world marked by relativism and too often excluding the transcendence and universality of reason , we are in great need of an authentic dialogue between religions and between cultures , capable of assisting us , in a spirit of fruitful co-operation , to overcome all the tensions together , " the pope said . in a speech on sept .
12 while visiting his native germany , benedict quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " " i am profoundly convinced that in the current world situation it is imperative that christians and muslims engage with one another in order to address the numerous challenges that present themselves to humanity , " the pope said . " christians and muslims must learn to work together ... in order to guard against all forms of intolerance and to oppose all manifestations of violence , " he added . trying to " build bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's meeting with muslims monday took less than a half hour the meeting at castel gandolfo , which had been heavily promoted by the vatican as a major step in reaffirming the pope 's commitment to inter-religious harmony , lasted barely 30 minutes . after his address , the pope shook hands and exchanged a few words with the assembled envoys , some of whom expressed satisfaction with the meeting . " i think it is time to put what happened behind us and build bridges among all the civilizations , " said iraqi ambassador albert yelda , who nevertheless defended the anger that had surfaced over the pope 's comments earlier this month . " many muslims around the world were offended , " yelda said .
" they expressed their feelings and they were right to do so .

" i should like to reiterate all the esteem and the profound respect that i have for muslim believers , " the pontiff told the ambassadors and charge d 'affaires he invited to his summer residence south of rome . his audience included envoys from iran , turkey and morocco and was the latest step in a diplomatic offensive by the vatican aimed at mollifying muslim anger over recent comments by the pope . " in a world marked by relativism and too often excluding the transcendence and universality of reason , we are in great need of an authentic dialogue between religions and between cultures , capable of assisting us , in a spirit of fruitful co-operation , to overcome all the tensions together , " the pope said . in a speech on sept .
12 while visiting his native germany , benedict quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " " i am profoundly convinced that in the current world situation it is imperative that christians and muslims engage with one another in order to address the numerous challenges that present themselves to humanity , " the pope said . " christians and muslims must learn to work together ... in order to guard against all forms of intolerance and to oppose all manifestations of violence , " he added . trying to " build bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's meeting with muslims monday took less than a half hour the meeting at castel gandolfo , which had been heavily promoted by the vatican as a major step in reaffirming the pope 's commitment to inter-religious harmony , lasted barely 30 minutes . after his address , the pope shook hands and exchanged a few words with the assembled envoys , some of whom expressed satisfaction with the meeting . " i think it is time to put what happened behind us and build bridges among all the civilizations , " said iraqi ambassador albert yelda , who nevertheless defended the anger that had surfaced over the pope 's comments earlier this month . " many muslims around the world were offended , " yelda said .
" they expressed their feelings and they were right to do so .
everybody has a right to express his feelings . " a furor erupted in the muslim world following the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in germany , in which he quoted the medieval emperor who equated islam with violence . since then , thousands of muslims in iran , afghanistan and the gaza strip have protested against the pope 's remarks . while insisting that the content of his lecture had been misinterpreted , the pope sought to calm the situation last week , repeatedly saying he was " deeply sorry " for any offence muslims might have taken from his comments . the italian paper la repubblica reported that in the over 2,000-year-old history of the catholic church , a pope has never had to publicly express regret over his statements several times . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

" like its neighbors , the small but wealthy country has made its borders tighter , " commented freiburg 's badische zeitung newspaper , from just over the border .
" however , if one looks closely , the law also includes improvements for asylum seekers and immigrants .
for example , rejected asylum seekers who for humanitarian reasons will not be deported are to receive a work permit .
a provision for hardship cases also entitles them to a residence permit if they have been successfully integrated .
this double strategy unexpectedly brought the right-wing populist -lrb- justice minister christoph -rrb- blocher great acclamation .
everyday practice will show which of the two sides of the new law will have the stronger effect . " " is the blocherization of switzerland now a threat ?
asked the südkurier , another german daily working from near the border , in constance .
" the -lrb- voters ' -rrb- decision is certainly problematic , but due to the entirely different democratic system , a shift to the right ca n't be read from it .
referendums in the confederation are always snapshots .
in contrast to 1992 , this time the right managed to put the issue of asylum abuse in the forefront .
thus , voters who think little of blocher also said yes .
every nation certainly has the right to enact clear regulations so that legislation regarding guests is n't taken advantage of .
nevertheless , there is unease .
among every stream of refugees there are persecuted people who must be helped without bureaucracy .
switzerland is battening down the hatches against them too - confident that others will come to their assistance .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in italy : switzerland plans to rely on its neighbors to avoid accepting refugees " amnesty international and the un refugee organization have reacted to the tightening of the asylum and foreigner legislation with criticism , " wrote spanish daily el mundo .
" the new regulation , among other things , allows illegal immigrants who show up in switzerland to be arrested .
the result of the referendum is understandable , however , if one takes into account that every fifth inhabitant of switzerland is of foreign origin .
thus , the proportion of foreigners is far higher than the average in the european union .
there is , as one minister put it , not room for everyone there . " " europe is so coveted among refugees as well as by migrants , because it is europe : because of its prosperity , but also its code of values - which are closely tied , " commented austria 's der standard newspaper .
" at the same time , europe is still far from finding a common answer to the asylum and migration problem .
that was demonstrated again just recently at the meeting of eu interior and justice ministers in tampere .
attempts to dismantle the principle of unanimity and to come to a common asylum and immigration policy through majority decisions still fail due to broad resistance .
many countries do n't want to cede sovereign rights , because they believe they will cope with the problems better irregardless of other states . " " such overwhelming majorities for the legislation on foreigners and especially for the revision of asylum law were not expected , " the neue zürcher zeitung pointed out .
" and , in as far as votes on migration policies are n't only about concrete contents but also about general attitudes to foreigners , the massive double yes ca n't leave liberal supporters pleased .
if the approval of tightening asylum law expresses more than concerns about administrative difficulties with a couple thousand rejected applicants without travel documents , it opens up a broad field for interpretation .
crime , the loss of economic and cultural certainties or islam as a bogeyman are common keywords in explanation attempts .
but more precise analyses and conclusions are tasks for more than just the day of the referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocher and his party got their way " there can be no argument about it : a good two-thirds of the voters said yes to the new asylum law , " wrote zurich 's tages-anzeiger .
" the discontent is too great about foreigners who deceive the authorities to get admission to switzerland , the paradise of prosperity .
the abuse dominated the discussion - the opponents failed to lead it in other directions and experienced a crushing defeat . … the clear result will namely give a boost to those powers within the -lrb- blocher 's -rrb- swiss people 's party , who want to take advantage of the still diffuse fears of the foreign in order to reap election successes .
" thus , the swiss people 's party will in the future only make an issue of abuse and attempt to torpedo the integration of the foreigners who live here , " the paper continued .
" the other mainstream parties must not let that happen .
for , yesterday the people also clearly said yes to the new law on foreigners that is supposed to improve integration . … if the double yes leads to the center parties relegating the abuse discussion to the past and embracing integration , good will also have come from yesterday 's result .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2006 switzerland battens down the hatches against foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 400 opponents of the new law demonstrated in zurich after the referendum swiss voters on sunday approved legislation that would give their country some of the most restrictive legislation on asylum seekers in europe , sparking criticism from papers around europe . " like its neighbors , the small but wealthy country has made its borders tighter , " commented freiburg 's badische zeitung newspaper , from just over the border .
" however , if one looks closely , the law also includes improvements for asylum seekers and immigrants .
for example , rejected asylum seekers who for humanitarian reasons will not be deported are to receive a work permit .
a provision for hardship cases also entitles them to a residence permit if they have been successfully integrated .
this double strategy unexpectedly brought the right-wing populist -lrb- justice minister christoph -rrb- blocher great acclamation .
everyday practice will show which of the two sides of the new law will have the stronger effect . " " is the blocherization of switzerland now a threat ?
asked the südkurier , another german daily working from near the border , in constance .
" the -lrb- voters ' -rrb- decision is certainly problematic , but due to the entirely different democratic system , a shift to the right ca n't be read from it .
referendums in the confederation are always snapshots .
in contrast to 1992 , this time the right managed to put the issue of asylum abuse in the forefront .
thus , voters who think little of blocher also said yes .
every nation certainly has the right to enact clear regulations so that legislation regarding guests is n't taken advantage of .
nevertheless , there is unease .
among every stream of refugees there are persecuted people who must be helped without bureaucracy .
switzerland is battening down the hatches against them too - confident that others will come to their assistance .
the germans , for example . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants in italy : switzerland plans to rely on its neighbors to avoid accepting refugees " amnesty international and the un refugee organization have reacted to the tightening of the asylum and foreigner legislation with criticism , " wrote spanish daily el mundo .
" the new regulation , among other things , allows illegal immigrants who show up in switzerland to be arrested .
the result of the referendum is understandable , however , if one takes into account that every fifth inhabitant of switzerland is of foreign origin .
thus , the proportion of foreigners is far higher than the average in the european union .
there is , as one minister put it , not room for everyone there . " " europe is so coveted among refugees as well as by migrants , because it is europe : because of its prosperity , but also its code of values - which are closely tied , " commented austria 's der standard newspaper .
" at the same time , europe is still far from finding a common answer to the asylum and migration problem .
that was demonstrated again just recently at the meeting of eu interior and justice ministers in tampere .
attempts to dismantle the principle of unanimity and to come to a common asylum and immigration policy through majority decisions still fail due to broad resistance .
many countries do n't want to cede sovereign rights , because they believe they will cope with the problems better irregardless of other states . " " such overwhelming majorities for the legislation on foreigners and especially for the revision of asylum law were not expected , " the neue zürcher zeitung pointed out .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this is certainly a serious blow to maglev , but hopefully german officials will get to the heart of what caused the tragedy .

but considering the human error angle of the crash and the relatively accident-free operation over the > 20 years they have been testing it and the operation in shanghai , the casualty number is relatively low and the survival rate -lrb- ~ 30 percent -rrb- relatively high , comparing the incident to airplane , car / bus and conventional railway crashes . - best of all : there was no fire -lrb- because there is no fuel on board -rrb- .
this looks like a typical screw-up , just like the only two accidents of the wuppertaler schwebebahn were .

another detail that probably contributed to the casualty number : in the shots of transrapid interiors i could not detect seat belts .
one can not offer any new cars without them , every airplane has them .
the interior safety standards of the transrapid should be at least as good as the tüv and most other safety control bodies worldwide require for cars : seatbelts and airbags .
another well-known safety enhancement : all seats should face backwards !
anything less is criminal negligence .
too bad that now it 's going to be even less likely that we will see a transrapid line in germany , but you can bet there will be many in asia .
the chinese are already talking about one from beijing to singapore via bangkok and kuala lumpur and a possible extension to india , and on to europe .

" i should like to reiterate all the esteem and the profound respect that i have for muslim believers , " the pontiff told the ambassadors and charge d 'affaires he invited to his summer residence south of rome . his audience included envoys from iran , turkey and morocco and was the latest step in a diplomatic offensive by the vatican aimed at mollifying muslim anger over recent comments by the pope . " in a world marked by relativism and too often excluding the transcendence and universality of reason , we are in great need of an authentic dialogue between religions and between cultures , capable of assisting us , in a spirit of fruitful co-operation , to overcome all the tensions together , " the pope said . in a speech on sept .
12 while visiting his native germany , benedict quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " " i am profoundly convinced that in the current world situation it is imperative that christians and muslims engage with one another in order to address the numerous challenges that present themselves to humanity , " the pope said . " christians and muslims must learn to work together ... in order to guard against all forms of intolerance and to oppose all manifestations of violence , " he added . trying to " build bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's meeting with muslims monday took less than a half hour the meeting at castel gandolfo , which had been heavily promoted by the vatican as a major step in reaffirming the pope 's commitment to inter-religious harmony , lasted barely 30 minutes . after his address , the pope shook hands and exchanged a few words with the assembled envoys , some of whom expressed satisfaction with the meeting . " i think it is time to put what happened behind us and build bridges among all the civilizations , " said iraqi ambassador albert yelda , who nevertheless defended the anger that had surfaced over the pope 's comments earlier this month . " many muslims around the world were offended , " yelda said .
" they expressed their feelings and they were right to do so .
everybody has a right to express his feelings . " a furor erupted in the muslim world following the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in germany , in which he quoted the medieval emperor who equated islam with violence . since then , thousands of muslims in iran , afghanistan and the gaza strip have protested against the pope 's remarks . while insisting that the content of his lecture had been misinterpreted , the pope sought to calm the situation last week , repeatedly saying he was " deeply sorry " for any offence muslims might have taken from his comments . the italian paper la repubblica reported that in the over 2,000-year-old history of the catholic church , a pope has never had to publicly express regret over his statements several times . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

" i should like to reiterate all the esteem and the profound respect that i have for muslim believers , " the pontiff told the ambassadors and charge d 'affaires he invited to his summer residence south of rome . his audience included envoys from iran , turkey and morocco and was the latest step in a diplomatic offensive by the vatican aimed at mollifying muslim anger over recent comments by the pope . " in a world marked by relativism and too often excluding the transcendence and universality of reason , we are in great need of an authentic dialogue between religions and between cultures , capable of assisting us , in a spirit of fruitful co-operation , to overcome all the tensions together , " the pope said . in a speech on sept .
12 while visiting his native germany , benedict quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " " i am profoundly convinced that in the current world situation it is imperative that christians and muslims engage with one another in order to address the numerous challenges that present themselves to humanity , " the pope said . " christians and muslims must learn to work together ... in order to guard against all forms of intolerance and to oppose all manifestations of violence , " he added . trying to " build bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's meeting with muslims monday took less than a half hour the meeting at castel gandolfo , which had been heavily promoted by the vatican as a major step in reaffirming the pope 's commitment to inter-religious harmony , lasted barely 30 minutes . after his address , the pope shook hands and exchanged a few words with the assembled envoys , some of whom expressed satisfaction with the meeting . " i think it is time to put what happened behind us and build bridges among all the civilizations , " said iraqi ambassador albert yelda , who nevertheless defended the anger that had surfaced over the pope 's comments earlier this month . " many muslims around the world were offended , " yelda said .
" they expressed their feelings and they were right to do so .
everybody has a right to express his feelings . " a furor erupted in the muslim world following the pope 's speech at the university of regensburg in germany , in which he quoted the medieval emperor who equated islam with violence . since then , thousands of muslims in iran , afghanistan and the gaza strip have protested against the pope 's remarks . while insisting that the content of his lecture had been misinterpreted , the pope sought to calm the situation last week , repeatedly saying he was " deeply sorry " for any offence muslims might have taken from his comments . the italian paper la repubblica reported that in the over 2,000-year-old history of the catholic church , a pope has never had to publicly express regret over his statements several times . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

seen from a helicopter , acergy piper is clearly too small to be an oil platform , but it does not look like a ship either .
if anything it resembles a set from the movies waterworld and mad max .
yet acergy piper is central to the heated debate about energy security , both in the uk and globally .
this week , the vessel will complete the roll-out of the world 's longest underwater gas pipeline , the langeled , which from 1 october will start delivering up to a fifth of all the gas consumed in the uk .
and in the future , the techniques employed here , deep under the sea , could be put to good use by the russian energy giant gazprom .
gazprom plans to roll out a $ 4bn -lrb- £ 2.1bn -rrb- , 1,200 kilometre-long gas pipeline across the baltic sea to germany , as well as developing its 1,400 square kilometre shtokman field in the barents sea , set to become the world 's largest offshore gas field .
complex route for all its importance and cutting-edge construction mission , acergy piper is far from polished .
instead , it resembles a heavy industry plant where the workers are cut off from the outside world for weeks on end , their movements restricted to this dreary , 170-metre long , slow-moving barge .
but those on board are not complaining .
" we 've got big-ass plasma in our lounge area , " shouts ferdy laurent , a loud californian with stickers from dozens of oil companies plastered all over his hard hat , and who likes to describe himself as a texan redneck .
on deck , a series of giant steel pipes - each weighing about 25 tonnes and measuring 42 inches in diameter - are pushed along an assembly line manned by industrial workers from more than 30 countries .
the pipes are central to a heated debate about energy security each of the workers is kept busy , welding the pipes together into a continuous tube that will cover a 1,200 kilometre stretch from the west coast of norway to easington in uk .
it is a complex process that involves a great deal of fine tuning .
each piece of pipeline is covered with several layers of protective coating to ensure it can survive at the bottom of the north sea for more than 50 years .
the joints are all given an ultrasound check before the pipe is being slowly lowered into the sea from its main firing line at angles designed to match the peaks and valleys of the seabed .
power games the completion of the langeled pipeline has done much to mollify concerned gas customers in the uk , who saw gas shortages last winter force prices to record levels for households and businesses alike .
this winter , getting langeled on stream is set to help push prices lower , prompting consumer groups to warn uk users against locking themselves in to the high fixed prices that are currently on offer .
the project also has also turned heads beyond britain .
on friday 15 september , a russian contingent visited acergy piper to see the langeled roll-out for themselves .
officially , the two norwegian companies behind the langeled project - hydro and statoil - are optimistic about their chances to be chosen as gazprom partners in major projects .
the massive pipelines could bring giant contracts and bigger bucks in pictures the langeled project - which at some stage consumed 30 % of the world 's entire carbon steel production , and which has come in on time and well under budget - is indeed impressive , and can act as a showcase that may put the norwegians at the front of the race to construct pipelines for the russians .
" we 're going to build it , " one official quips on board the acergy piper when asked about a 555 kilometre pipeline gazprom wants constructed in extreme conditions in the barents sea .
but privately , some officials concede that gazprom is far from prepared to treat them as equals .
" they are interested in our technology , but that 's all , " says one senior official .
as such , acergy piper does little more than play a part in a much bigger power game : gazprom has access to russia 's vast - and largely underdeveloped - energy resources , and it desperately needs the help of western energy giants that often possess greater skills and technology .
giant contracts are on offer , though in return russia wants both direct access to lucrative western energy markets and equity stakes in the companies it enters into partnership with .
so far , during lengthy talks , the russians have been playing their cards close to their chests .
but that could all change very quickly , and industry observers reckon that major contracts could soon be awarded as even the russians ' legendary patience crumbles in the face of powerful market forces .

seen from a helicopter , acergy piper is clearly too small to be an oil platform , but it does not look like a ship either .
if anything it resembles a set from the movies waterworld and mad max .
yet acergy piper is central to the heated debate about energy security , both in the uk and globally .
this week , the vessel will complete the roll-out of the world 's longest underwater gas pipeline , the langeled , which from 1 october will start delivering up to a fifth of all the gas consumed in the uk .
and in the future , the techniques employed here , deep under the sea , could be put to good use by the russian energy giant gazprom .
gazprom plans to roll out a $ 4bn -lrb- £ 2.1bn -rrb- , 1,200 kilometre-long gas pipeline across the baltic sea to germany , as well as developing its 1,400 square kilometre shtokman field in the barents sea , set to become the world 's largest offshore gas field .
complex route for all its importance and cutting-edge construction mission , acergy piper is far from polished .
instead , it resembles a heavy industry plant where the workers are cut off from the outside world for weeks on end , their movements restricted to this dreary , 170-metre long , slow-moving barge .
but those on board are not complaining .
" we 've got big-ass plasma in our lounge area , " shouts ferdy laurent , a loud californian with stickers from dozens of oil companies plastered all over his hard hat , and who likes to describe himself as a texan redneck .
on deck , a series of giant steel pipes - each weighing about 25 tonnes and measuring 42 inches in diameter - are pushed along an assembly line manned by industrial workers from more than 30 countries .
the pipes are central to a heated debate about energy security each of the workers is kept busy , welding the pipes together into a continuous tube that will cover a 1,200 kilometre stretch from the west coast of norway to easington in uk .
it is a complex process that involves a great deal of fine tuning .
each piece of pipeline is covered with several layers of protective coating to ensure it can survive at the bottom of the north sea for more than 50 years .
the joints are all given an ultrasound check before the pipe is being slowly lowered into the sea from its main firing line at angles designed to match the peaks and valleys of the seabed .
power games the completion of the langeled pipeline has done much to mollify concerned gas customers in the uk , who saw gas shortages last winter force prices to record levels for households and businesses alike .
this winter , getting langeled on stream is set to help push prices lower , prompting consumer groups to warn uk users against locking themselves in to the high fixed prices that are currently on offer .
the project also has also turned heads beyond britain .
on friday 15 september , a russian contingent visited acergy piper to see the langeled roll-out for themselves .
officially , the two norwegian companies behind the langeled project - hydro and statoil - are optimistic about their chances to be chosen as gazprom partners in major projects .
the massive pipelines could bring giant contracts and bigger bucks in pictures the langeled project - which at some stage consumed 30 % of the world 's entire carbon steel production , and which has come in on time and well under budget - is indeed impressive , and can act as a showcase that may put the norwegians at the front of the race to construct pipelines for the russians .
" we 're going to build it , " one official quips on board the acergy piper when asked about a 555 kilometre pipeline gazprom wants constructed in extreme conditions in the barents sea .
but privately , some officials concede that gazprom is far from prepared to treat them as equals .
" they are interested in our technology , but that 's all , " says one senior official .
as such , acergy piper does little more than play a part in a much bigger power game : gazprom has access to russia 's vast - and largely underdeveloped - energy resources , and it desperately needs the help of western energy giants that often possess greater skills and technology .
giant contracts are on offer , though in return russia wants both direct access to lucrative western energy markets and equity stakes in the companies it enters into partnership with .
so far , during lengthy talks , the russians have been playing their cards close to their chests .
but that could all change very quickly , and industry observers reckon that major contracts could soon be awarded as even the russians ' legendary patience crumbles in the face of powerful market forces .

by nick triggle health reporter , bbc news health will be keenly debated at the labour party conference this week .
that is not surprising as hardly a week has gone by this year without the nhs headline news .
chancellor gordon brown , for many the apparent prime minister in waiting , is considering plans for an independent nhs board .
and the conference will hear other ministers ' proposals for an nhs constitution , like the bbc charter .
but the government has already introduced root and branch reform of the health service .
just what has been the impact , and is it fair to say the nhs is in crisis ?
first it was deficits and now there is the first national strike in the nhs for nearly 20 years .
and the worst may be yet to come , with the new nhs boss , david nicholson , warning hospitals may be stripped of many of their key services .
predicatably , the government says it is all part of its plan to reform the way care is provided .
ministers say they want to see more people treated in the community and out of hospital so it is logical to see services such as emergency care centralised in fewer hospitals .
the opposition are having none of it , scenting blood , they claim the government has lost control .
so what is the truth ?
' fast enough ' henry de zoete , of centre-right think tank reform , believes the problem , if any , is that the government is not going far enough , fast enough .
" in many ways we believe the government has got to be bolder if it is to get this right .
" increasing use of the private sector , more market-based reforms and hospital reconfiguration is the right way forward , but ministers should not be too shy about it . "
but the experiences of health bosses in greater manchester illustrate the difficulties the nhs faces when it takes the bull by the horns .
they have announced that one of the four hospitals run by the pennine acute hospitals nhs trust is to be stripped of services , such as a & e and emergency surgery .
2006 ...
from bad to worse march - april - thousands of jobs losses announced by hospitals in bid to save money april - nurses barrack the health secretary , forcing her to cut short her speech at their conference june - the nhs deficit tops £ 500m , the largest in recent years , prompting more negative headlines august - local managers start to discuss closing and downgrading hospitals september - first national nhs strike for 18 years as supply staff walk out cps : link href = " " id = " 5373096 " style = " rightarrow " > why an independent nhs board ?
in doing , so they will create what they are dubbing the country 's first " locality hospital " concentrating on social services and mental health .
the final decision is expected by the end of the year , but it has already attracted a lot of criticism locally , especially since the nhs trust is facing a £ 28m deficit .
the proposals will end up reducing the deficits , but managers are quick point out it is being motivated more by a desire to move care out into the community and get around eu working restrictions , which are forcing doctors to reduce their hours .
tim presswood , chairman of the committee overseeing the changes , acknowledges changes have brought about " uncertainty and concern " .
but he added : " planned change has to happen .
allowing services to continue the way that they are currently structured is not an option as all services are facing great pressure . "
however , the government and nhs managers are not finding it easy to convince staff .
dr barry monk , a dermatologist at bedford hospital , which is facing an uncertain future , has announced he will be standing for election on the ticket of saving the hospital .
he said doctors have had enough and urged them to follow his lead by interfering in the " cosy world of politics " .
strike and hundreds of workers from nhs logistics , the health service 's supply agency , walked out last week and will do so again on tuesday in the first national strike in the nhs for 18 years .
they are objecting to the sell-off of the agency to private delivery firm dhl - and while this is not directly related to hospital cuts it is symbolic of the unease felt towards the increasing role of the private sector , another of the government 's health reforms .
jonathan fielden , deputy chairman of the british medical association , sees difficulties for the government .
" if the changes are well planned , i think many doctors could support them .
but what we could end up seeing is hospitals losing too many services because of the financial pressures .
" and that is where staff start to get agitated . "
joe farrington-douglas , a health researcher at the institute for public policy research , agreed .
" if they do n't take staff with them , it could be very damaging for their reforms .
what we need to do is allow decisions to be made at a local level , give them ownership of it . "
but he cited the barracking the normally-moderate royal college of nursing conference gave health secretary patricia hewitt in april as an illustration of the task facing ministers .
nigel edwards , director of policy at the nhs confederation , calls it a " curious paradox " .
" at a time when waiting lists are falling and huge amounts of money have been invested , the government is struggling to convince people they are doing the right thing for the nhs .
" i do n't think it is a crisis .
it seems to be a question of perception and that is not always an easy thing to change . "

by nick triggle health reporter , bbc news health will be keenly debated at the labour party conference this week .
that is not surprising as hardly a week has gone by this year without the nhs headline news .
chancellor gordon brown , for many the apparent prime minister in waiting , is considering plans for an independent nhs board .
and the conference will hear other ministers ' proposals for an nhs constitution , like the bbc charter .
but the government has already introduced root and branch reform of the health service .
just what has been the impact , and is it fair to say the nhs is in crisis ?
hospitals are facing cuts to services first it was deficits and now there is the first national strike in the nhs for nearly 20 years .
and the worst may be yet to come , with the new nhs boss , david nicholson , warning hospitals may be stripped of many of their key services .
predicatably , the government says it is all part of its plan to reform the way care is provided .
ministers say they want to see more people treated in the community and out of hospital so it is logical to see services such as emergency care centralised in fewer hospitals .
the opposition are having none of it , scenting blood , they claim the government has lost control .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- spam trail uncovers junk empire home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 25 september 2006 , 06:39 gmt 07:39 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version spam trail uncovers junk empire by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news website the junk mail was touting all kinds of drugs an investigation into a seemingly routine series of spam messages has revealed how sophisticated the business of online crime has become .
the story begins with the junk mail messages themselves that were sent during april and may of 2006 .
outwardly , said patrick peterson , chief technology officer of security firm ironport who led the investigation , the messages hawking pharmaceuticals looked like the billions of other junk mail messages swilling around the net .
the only initial point of interest about them was that they were appearing in bigger numbers than most spam runs .
every day for 14 days the spammers behind the junk mail campaign pumped out more than 100m messages .
dark side the spam got more interesting when mr peterson and his colleagues took a closer look .
many of the junk messages had , hidden within them , text from jrr tolkien 's classic work the hobbit .
this text was included , said mr peterson , in an attempt to convince spam filters that the messages were genuine and not junk .
many spam messages use excerpts from novels or other works in this way .
analysis of the junk mail revealed that there were more than 2,000 variations in the content of the messages making up the spam run .
over the course of the weeks when the spam was being sent a new variant of message was despatched every 12 minutes .
the sheer scale of the spamming operation became clearer when mr peterson started tracking where the spam was being sent from .
analysis of the net addresses where the e-mail messages originated showed that more than 100,000 hijacked home computers spread across 119 nations had been used to despatch the junk mail .
the complexity is what 's amazing to see pat peterson , ironport to try to beat anti-spam techniques that look up the net address from which spam originates to see if it that location has a reputation as a spammer , many of the machines used to send the mail had been recently hijacked .
analysis showed that many had only been taken over in the last 30 days , said mr peterson .
" we ran the sources of this and found out a massive distribution of countries , " mr peterson told the bbc news website , " it 's very much centred in europe . "
this widespread , sophisticated infrastructure involved more than 1500 web domains that acted as the web shops for the drugs advertised in the junk messages .
many of the domains were hosted by firms that advertise themselves as providing " bullet proof " hosting that will resist attempts to shut down the sites - no matter what information is on the website .
junk empire behind the scenes was a sophisticated network of computers that handled the traffic generated when people clicked on links in messages and directed them to the right site .
anyone clicking on the links in the junk mail messages would get re-directed to one of the 1500 domains - each one of which was made to look like a real organisation .
if you have an e-mail account , you probably get spam " they were trying to make it look as legitimate as possible , " he said .
on some of the fake pharmacies , said mr peterson , the spammers had gone to the trouble of creating fake biographies for the supposed founders of the online shop .
when an ironport employee went to check the supposed real world location of one shop they found a vacant lot .
using a one-time use credit card , mr peterson bought some pharmaceuticals from one of the web shops and was amazed when a package arrived in the post .
" when we have done this in the past it 's been clear that they just want to rip people off , " he said .
before now most spammers have been happy to take credit card details and cash and do nothing to fulfil orders .
instead , with this spam network , the orders were fulfilled by a pharmaceutical firm in india .
the drugs received have now been sent for testing to see just what they contain .
" the complexity is what 's amazing to see , " said mr peterson .
ironport was planning to continue its investigation , he said , to see if it will be possible to determine just who is behind the net-spanning spam operation .
information has also been passed to the fbi to help its investigation into a us-based hosting firm that has been implicated in a lot of spam and scam campaigns .

the story begins with the junk mail messages themselves that were sent during april and may of 2006 .
outwardly , said patrick peterson , chief technology officer of security firm ironport who led the investigation , the messages hawking pharmaceuticals looked like the billions of other junk mail messages swilling around the net .
the only initial point of interest about them was that they were appearing in bigger numbers than most spam runs .
every day for 14 days the spammers behind the junk mail campaign pumped out more than 100m messages .
dark side the spam got more interesting when mr peterson and his colleagues took a closer look .
many of the junk messages had , hidden within them , text from jrr tolkien 's classic work the hobbit .
this text was included , said mr peterson , in an attempt to convince spam filters that the messages were genuine and not junk .
many spam messages use excerpts from novels or other works in this way .
analysis of the junk mail revealed that there were more than 2,000 variations in the content of the messages making up the spam run .
over the course of the weeks when the spam was being sent a new variant of message was despatched every 12 minutes .
the sheer scale of the spamming operation became clearer when mr peterson started tracking where the spam was being sent from .
analysis of the net addresses where the e-mail messages originated showed that more than 100,000 hijacked home computers spread across 119 nations had been used to despatch the junk mail .
the complexity is what 's amazing to see pat peterson , ironport to try to beat anti-spam techniques that look up the net address from which spam originates to see if it that location has a reputation as a spammer , many of the machines used to send the mail had been recently hijacked .
analysis showed that many had only been taken over in the last 30 days , said mr peterson .
" we ran the sources of this and found out a massive distribution of countries , " mr peterson told the bbc news website , " it 's very much centred in europe . "
this widespread , sophisticated infrastructure involved more than 1500 web domains that acted as the web shops for the drugs advertised in the junk messages .
many of the domains were hosted by firms that advertise themselves as providing " bullet proof " hosting that will resist attempts to shut down the sites - no matter what information is on the website .
junk empire behind the scenes was a sophisticated network of computers that handled the traffic generated when people clicked on links in messages and directed them to the right site .
anyone clicking on the links in the junk mail messages would get re-directed to one of the 1500 domains - each one of which was made to look like a real organisation .
if you have an e-mail account , you probably get spam " they were trying to make it look as legitimate as possible , " he said .
on some of the fake pharmacies , said mr peterson , the spammers had gone to the trouble of creating fake biographies for the supposed founders of the online shop .
when an ironport employee went to check the supposed real world location of one shop they found a vacant lot .
using a one-time use credit card , mr peterson bought some pharmaceuticals from one of the web shops and was amazed when a package arrived in the post .
" when we have done this in the past it 's been clear that they just want to rip people off , " he said .
before now most spammers have been happy to take credit card details and cash and do nothing to fulfil orders .
instead , with this spam network , the orders were fulfilled by a pharmaceutical firm in india .
the drugs received have now been sent for testing to see just what they contain .
" the complexity is what 's amazing to see , " said mr peterson .
ironport was planning to continue its investigation , he said , to see if it will be possible to determine just who is behind the net-spanning spam operation .
information has also been passed to the fbi to help its investigation into a us-based hosting firm that has been implicated in a lot of spam and scam campaigns .

the complexity is what 's amazing to see pat peterson , ironport to try to beat anti-spam techniques that look up the net address from which spam originates to see if it that location has a reputation as a spammer , many of the machines used to send the mail had been recently hijacked .
analysis showed that many had only been taken over in the last 30 days , said mr peterson .
" we ran the sources of this and found out a massive distribution of countries , " mr peterson told the bbc news website , " it 's very much centred in europe . "
this widespread , sophisticated infrastructure involved more than 1500 web domains that acted as the web shops for the drugs advertised in the junk messages .
many of the domains were hosted by firms that advertise themselves as providing " bullet proof " hosting that will resist attempts to shut down the sites - no matter what information is on the website .
junk empire behind the scenes was a sophisticated network of computers that handled the traffic generated when people clicked on links in messages and directed them to the right site .
anyone clicking on the links in the junk mail messages would get re-directed to one of the 1500 domains - each one of which was made to look like a real organisation .
if you have an e-mail account , you probably get spam " they were trying to make it look as legitimate as possible , " he said .
on some of the fake pharmacies , said mr peterson , the spammers had gone to the trouble of creating fake biographies for the supposed founders of the online shop .
when an ironport employee went to check the supposed real world location of one shop they found a vacant lot .
using a one-time use credit card , mr peterson bought some pharmaceuticals from one of the web shops and was amazed when a package arrived in the post .
" when we have done this in the past it 's been clear that they just want to rip people off , " he said .
before now most spammers have been happy to take credit card details and cash and do nothing to fulfil orders .
instead , with this spam network , the orders were fulfilled by a pharmaceutical firm in india .
the drugs received have now been sent for testing to see just what they contain .
" the complexity is what 's amazing to see , " said mr peterson .
ironport was planning to continue its investigation , he said , to see if it will be possible to determine just who is behind the net-spanning spam operation .
information has also been passed to the fbi to help its investigation into a us-based hosting firm that has been implicated in a lot of spam and scam campaigns .

the story begins with the junk mail messages themselves that were sent during april and may of 2006 .
outwardly , said patrick peterson , chief technology officer of security firm ironport who led the investigation , the messages hawking pharmaceuticals looked like the billions of other junk mail messages swilling around the net .
the only initial point of interest about them was that they were appearing in bigger numbers than most spam runs .
every day for 14 days the spammers behind the junk mail campaign pumped out more than 100m messages .
dark side the spam got more interesting when mr peterson and his colleagues took a closer look .
many of the junk messages had , hidden within them , text from jrr tolkien 's classic work the hobbit .
this text was included , said mr peterson , in an attempt to convince spam filters that the messages were genuine and not junk .
many spam messages use excerpts from novels or other works in this way .
analysis of the junk mail revealed that there were more than 2,000 variations in the content of the messages making up the spam run .
over the course of the weeks when the spam was being sent a new variant of message was despatched every 12 minutes .
the sheer scale of the spamming operation became clearer when mr peterson started tracking where the spam was being sent from .
analysis of the net addresses where the e-mail messages originated showed that more than 100,000 hijacked home computers spread across 119 nations had been used to despatch the junk mail .
the complexity is what 's amazing to see pat peterson , ironport to try to beat anti-spam techniques that look up the net address from which spam originates to see if it that location has a reputation as a spammer , many of the machines used to send the mail had been recently hijacked .

the legal wage minimum rises by 25p to £ 5.35 an hour on 1 october but a big hike in 2007 would hurt business and boost the black economy , the cbi said .
however the tuc , which represents many workers , says that businesses can afford more wage rises .
the positive economic outlook means a minimum wage of £ 6 by 2008 should be " easily affordable " , it said .
energy drain in a submission made to the government 's low pay commission , the cbi said the minimum wage would have risen by 27 % since 2002 - faster than average wage growth of 18 % .
rising energy costs , lower 2007 growth forecasts and the cost of employment regulation meant firms could not cope with further heavy minimum wage rises , it added . "
continuing heavy annual increases are simply not sustainable " susan anderson director of hr policy , cbi and it said that some sectors , including hospitality and food producers , had been forced to cut staff and reduce benefits in order to afford the wages while remaining competitive .
others were being under-cut by employers paying cash-in-hand on the black market , circumventing the law .
" the minimum wage has improved living standards for many workers , but continuing heavy annual increases are simply not sustainable , " cbi director of hr policy susan anderson said .
" we hope that -lsb- in 2007 -rsb- the rise will be more modest so that employers can consolidate costs to date and restore the vital differentials in pay that have been flattened by the minimum wage which encourage people to train and take on extra responsibilities in the workplace . "
' tougher enforcement ' the tuc said it wanted the cbi to back its calls for the minimum wage to be more rigorously enforced by hm revenues and customs .
it also wants a crackdown on firms that victimise staff who claim the minimum wage , and for more regulation of agencies that abuse workers rights .
paul sellers , from the tuc , told the bbc he did not believe an increased minimum wage would cause problems .
" we actually think that the kind of increases we 've had in recent years are pretty sensible , so our target is that the minimum wage for adults should increase to at least £ 6 by 2008 - and that 's only an increase of about 30p to 35p a year .
" i ca n't believe that business ca n't cope with that . "
he said the minimum wage should keep pace with average earnings " otherwise the pay of the lowest paid will fall behind the rest of us " .
" the minimum wage has n't had detrimental side effects , so i ca n't quite see why the cbi should be crying wolf at the moment . "
but earlier this month the british retail consortium -lrb- brc -rrb- claimed that the introduction of the minimum wage had led to 78,000 job losses on the high street .
it predicted more would result from october 's the increase in the wage in its submission to the low pay commission , the brc urged the government to delay the latest rise .

the legal wage minimum rises by 25p to £ 5.35 an hour on 1 october but a big hike in 2007 would hurt business and boost the black economy , the cbi said .
however the tuc , which represents many workers , says that businesses can afford more wage rises .
the positive economic outlook means a minimum wage of £ 6 by 2008 should be " easily affordable " , it said .
energy drain in a submission made to the government 's low pay commission , the cbi said the minimum wage would have risen by 27 % since 2002 - faster than average wage growth of 18 % .
rising energy costs , lower 2007 growth forecasts and the cost of employment regulation meant firms could not cope with further heavy minimum wage rises , it added .
continuing heavy annual increases are simply not sustainable susan anderson director of hr policy , cbi and it said that some sectors , including hospitality and food producers , had been forced to cut staff and reduce benefits in order to afford the wages while remaining competitive .
others were being under-cut by employers paying cash-in-hand on the black market , circumventing the law .
" the minimum wage has improved living standards for many workers , but continuing heavy annual increases are simply not sustainable , " cbi director of hr policy susan anderson said .
" we hope that -lsb- in 2007 -rsb- the rise will be more modest so that employers can consolidate costs to date and restore the vital differentials in pay that have been flattened by the minimum wage which encourage people to train and take on extra responsibilities in the workplace . "
' tougher enforcement ' the tuc said it wanted the cbi to back its calls for the minimum wage to be more rigorously enforced by hm revenues and customs .
it also wants a crackdown on firms that victimise staff who claim the minimum wage , and for more regulation of agencies that abuse workers rights .
paul sellers , from the tuc , told the bbc he did not believe an increased minimum wage would cause problems .
" we actually think that the kind of increases we 've had in recent years are pretty sensible , so our target is that the minimum wage for adults should increase to at least £ 6 by 2008 - and that 's only an increase of about 30p to 35p a year .
" i ca n't believe that business ca n't cope with that . "
he said the minimum wage should keep pace with average earnings " otherwise the pay of the lowest paid will fall behind the rest of us " .

the european commissioner told the progress rally some union leaders felt " shut out " - but the party had changed .
mr mandelson said " old style operators " should not decide when and how tony blair steps down as prime minister .
he said rejecting the new labour agenda would make the party look insincere in everything it had done in office .
' celebrate blair ' mr mandelson said he was hopeful about labour 's prospects for the future but said the party had suffered a " moment of madness " in the recent leadership wrangling .
the way the succession was handled must be able to command voters ' respect .
" i believe that we should recognise tony blair 's exceptional talent and his achievements and what he has done for our party and our country , " said mr mandelson .
" let 's celebrate the fact that at his tender age he has a lot more to offer ...
" when he finally calls time , as he will , let it be his decision , let it be his timing , let it be his judgement when to name the day in the calendar , not the decision of old style operators in the party who thrive in smoke-filled rooms and are best left there , frankly . "
' their choice ' mr mandelson , a close blair ally , said the trade unions were the " ballast " of the labour party and their contribution should be welcomed .
but he said some union general secretaries and presidents would see the coming of a leadership election - where the unions have a third of the votes - as an opportunity to regain their former role in the party .
" they feel they have been shut out of the party but that was their choice to reject new labour , " he said .
constituency parties had now found a voice and one-member-one-vote was here to stay , he said .
' no rejection ' mr mandelson urged labour activists to be proud of the government 's achievements as that was the only way to persuade voters to recognise the successes .
" to reject new labour now would be a rejection of the very sincerity and success of all our actions since we came to office in 1997 , " he said .
he said there needed to be a renewal of labour 's agenda .
but he said : " the new policy agenda needed for the next election will not come out of thin air or , by definition , it wo n't come out of one person 's head . "
instead , all the talents of the party must be used in an inclusive way .
mr mandelson cautioned against returning to the " intolerance " of the 1980s where those putting forward alternative views had been dismissed as " mavericks " .
former health secretary alan milburn , seen as a possible future leadership candidate , told the meeting the party must not " abandon new labour , we need to entrench and deepen it " .
and transport secretary douglas alexander said labour must not focus on the conservatives and changes in the opinion poll ratings .
he said the party must concentrate on the way the world was changing and forge policies to meet those new challenges .

the european commissioner told the progress rally some union leaders felt " shut out " - but the party had changed .
mr mandelson said " old style operators " should not decide when and how tony blair steps down as prime minister .
he said rejecting the new labour agenda would make the party look insincere in everything it had done in office .
' celebrate blair ' mr mandelson said he was hopeful about labour 's prospects for the future but said the party had suffered a " moment of madness " in the recent leadership wrangling .
the way the succession was handled must be able to command voters ' respect .
" i believe that we should recognise tony blair 's exceptional talent and his achievements and what he has done for our party and our country , " said mr mandelson .
" let 's celebrate the fact that at his tender age he has a lot more to offer ...
" when he finally calls time , as he will , let it be his decision , let it be his timing , let it be his judgement when to name the day in the calendar , not the decision of old style operators in the party who thrive in smoke-filled rooms and are best left there , frankly . "
' their choice ' mr mandelson , a close blair ally , said the trade unions were the " ballast " of the labour party and their contribution should be welcomed .
but he said some union general secretaries and presidents would see the coming of a leadership election - where the unions have a third of the votes - as an opportunity to regain their former role in the party .
" they feel they have been shut out of the party but that was their choice to reject new labour , " he said .
constituency parties had now found a voice and one-member-one-vote was here to stay , he said .
' no rejection ' mr mandelson urged labour activists to be proud of the government 's achievements as that was the only way to persuade voters to recognise the successes .
" to reject new labour now would be a rejection of the very sincerity and success of all our actions since we came to office in 1997 , " he said .
he said there needed to be a renewal of labour 's agenda .
but he said : " the new policy agenda needed for the next election will not come out of thin air or , by definition , it wo n't come out of one person 's head . "
instead , all the talents of the party must be used in an inclusive way .
mr mandelson cautioned against returning to the " intolerance " of the 1980s where those putting forward alternative views had been dismissed as " mavericks " .
former health secretary alan milburn , seen as a possible future leadership candidate , told the meeting the party must not " abandon new labour , we need to entrench and deepen it " .
and transport secretary douglas alexander said labour must not focus on the conservatives and changes in the opinion poll ratings .
he said the party must concentrate on the way the world was changing and forge policies to meet those new challenges .

however , icap , the world 's largest inter-dealer broker and a recent entrant into the ftse 100 stock index , said the talks had been called off .
a number of firms including nasdaq and euronext have been linked to a takeover of the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- .
the lse has resisted approaches , saying that it can continue to grow alone .
share drive earlier this year , lse chief executive clara furse said that the company would not do a deal for the sake of doing a deal .
however , analysts and market observers have speculated that stock exchanges will need to merge if they wanted to keep on growing and offer a wide-range of global financial services .
already the new york stock exchange has agreed to merge with european market euronext , and analysts are expecting further tie-ups in the industry .
the lse is attractive because of the uk 's light-touch regulatory regime that makes it less onerous for companies to list their shares .
analysts also said that a tie up with icap , which offers derivatives , fixed income , energy and other money-market broking services , would make sense .
reports over the weekend suggest that icap had stepped back from talks because it felt that the lse 's shares were overvalued .
the continuing bid speculation and good earnings figures have seen the lse 's shares more than double in value over the past 12 months .

however , icap , the world 's largest inter-dealer broker and a recent entrant into the ftse 100 stock index , said the talks had been called off .
a number of firms including nasdaq and euronext have been linked to a takeover of the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- .
the lse has resisted approaches , saying that it can continue to grow alone .
share drive earlier this year , lse chief executive clara furse said that the company would not do a deal for the sake of doing a deal .
however , analysts and market observers have speculated that stock exchanges will need to merge if they wanted to keep on growing and offer a wide-range of global financial services .
already the new york stock exchange has agreed to merge with european market euronext , and analysts are expecting further tie-ups in the industry .
the lse is attractive because of the uk 's light-touch regulatory regime that makes it less onerous for companies to list their shares .
analysts also said that a tie up with icap , which offers derivatives , fixed income , energy and other money-market broking services , would make sense .
reports over the weekend suggest that icap had stepped back from talks because it felt that the lse 's shares were overvalued .

the high-definition age of video gaming is underway as microsoft and sony showed the best of their games for the coming months .
we pick out the titles generating the most buzz as the next-generation battle starts in earnest .
blue dragon -lrb- xbox 360 -rrb- blue dragon is a key title in microsoft 's battle to crack japan it 's impossible to miss blue dragon at this year 's tokyo games show -lrb- tgs -rrb- .
almost everyone has a bag over their shoulder , given out at the main train station or on the microsoft stand , emblazoned with the blue beast .
from final fantasy creator , hironobu sakaguchi , this manga-style role playing game -lrb- rpg -rrb- represents the first of many xbox titles aimed at the japanese market .
it revolves around a young boy named shu and his friends as they battle the evil nene and an ancient race of humans to save the world .
the title of the game comes from the main character 's ability to control his " shadow " that appear as a blue dragon .
other characters have shadows of different mythical beasts .
with a focus on narrative rather than gameplay , the title is at time frustrating for gamers not used to rpgs .
however , the vibrant , colourful world and cute animated characters provide a mesmerising experience and an accessible insight into japanese gaming culture .
final fantasy xiii -lrb- ps3 -rrb- final fantasy is one of the world 's most popular videogame franchises although it is still a long way from being released , final fantasy xiii has been causing a commotion at tgs .
the long-running final fantasy series has a special place in gamers ' affections here .
only a trailer for the latest instalment was on show but it was enough to draw huge crowds to the square enix stand .
one and two hour waits to get into the closed theatre are common .
fabula nova crystallis , or the " the new tale of the crystal " , encompasses three games : two for the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- and one for mobile phones .
this hugely anticipated title looks stunning on the trailer and could be the game that that persuades many gamers to part with the cash needed for the ps3 .
metal gear solid 4 : guns of the patriots -lrb- ps3 -rrb- metal gear solid 4 is expected to drive ps3 sales the trailer for the hotly anticipated mgs4 contains the line : " some legends must die " , perhaps confirming that this will be the last outing for main character snake .
the mgs titles have been best sellers on the ps2 and this new game for the ps3 does not look like it will disappoint .
the trailer shows snake using his octopus camouflage that changes colour and texture like an octopus , allowing him to blend into the background .
in one scene his suit melts into a hotel wall 's flock wallpaper as he sneaks up on enemies and in another he disguises himself as a statue on a plinth .
the grizzly hero also shows off some new moves , including rolling towards the enemy in a barrel .
this title will probably not be released until 2007 but the in-game footage from this trailer should be enough to whet most gamers ' appetites .
sonic the hedgehog -lrb- xbox 360 , ps3 -rrb- the blue hedgehog returns in sonic for next-gen consoles the return of the blue hedgehog provides a fast-paced title worthy of its predecessors .
the first next-generation console title from sega does not radically tamper with the original sonic format , and that proves to be a good thing .
the game still involves racing through lush landscapes and urban decay at breakneck speeds , collecting rings and fighting robotic foes as you go .
dizzying manoeuvres on waterslides and steep slopes sees sonic using the whole of the screen .
there is now the option to play as sonic or as his new pal silver , who forgoes speed for telekinetic abilities .
silver knocks out enemies not with a somersault but by levitating boxes and throwing them at the bad guys .
all of this action adds up to make this reversion of an old favourite a hugely enjoyable title with gameplay that does not disappoint .
devil may cry 4 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- gothic title devil may cry is a global best-seller at one point during tgs there was a two-hour queue to play devil may cry 4 , showing the level of interest in this sequel .
dante , the main character in previous games , is replaced by new character nero in this stylish and atmospheric sequel .
nero comes equipped with double-barrelled pistols and sabre to take out the demons of the underworld .
there are also new features including a combat system that sees nero 's right arm extend to grab enemies from far away .
once hooked , you can reel them in and finish them off with any number of combination moves .
the gothic architecture and lighting of dmc4 set the tone for the game perfectly and the attention to texture and detail is impressive .
the gameplay of this slasher title is at times repetitive and the demo did not hold too many surprises .
however , dmc4 it is still in development and the team behind it still have another year to prove this is a worthy successor to the popular first three titles of the series .
lost odyssey -lrb- xbox 360 -rrb- lost odyssey was showing in tokyo the demo of lost odyssey , the second rpg for the xbox by hironobu sakaguchi , starts with a dramatic battle scene between two huge sword-wielding armies .
visually it has an epic film-like quality .
as the battle progresses and casualties mount the scene cuts to the main character , kain , a millennium old warrior .
as you take control of the character the transition from cut scene to play is seamless , and the quality of the graphics continues .
like blue dragon , the gaming is menu-based , meaning that you must choose the correct action or object for kain before it can be used .
this can be frustrating at times as it interrupts the gameplay , but is part and parcel of a lot of the rpg genre .
the sequence ends with a meteor impact that destroys kain 's opponents in a flood of realistically rendered molten rock .
sakaguchi has said that a lot of the game will be seen through kain 's dreams and memories , but whether the demo sequence on show was one of these will not be known until the game is released next year .
gran turismo hd and ridge racer 7 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- ridge racer 7 enters the high definition age showing in 1080p high definition at tgs , these driving games are visually stunning .
both cars and landscapes are modelled with incredible attention to detail .
ridge racer 7 has had some problems at tgs running on the ps3 , but the game is still incomplete .
the gameplay of both titles is not vastly different from their predecessors .
gthd for example is effectively a ps3 version of the ps2 game .
gamers will have to wait for gt5 for an entirely new experience .
however , both feature new customisation options .
rr7 allows gamers to tinker with their cars and adjust the car 's ride and even the interior of their cars , while gthd exploits the ps3s online capability , allowing gamers to buy new cars and tracks .
more than 700 cars will be available for download , and when you are told that each one takes the equivalent of 6 months to make you realise why they are not all released with the boxed game .

one and two hour waits to get into the closed theatre are common .
fabula nova crystallis , or the " the new tale of the crystal " , encompasses three games : two for the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- and one for mobile phones .

as you take control of the character the transition from cut scene to play is seamless , and the quality of the graphics continues .
like blue dragon , the gaming is menu-based , meaning that you must choose the correct action or object for kain before it can be used .

the title of the game comes from the main character 's ability to control his " shadow " that appear as a blue dragon .

the first next-generation console title from sega does not radically tamper with the original sonic format , and that proves to be a good thing .

dizzying manoeuvres on waterslides and steep slopes sees sonic using the whole of the screen .
there is now the option to play as sonic or as his new pal silver , who forgoes speed for telekinetic abilities .

as the battle progresses and casualties mount the scene cuts to the main character , kain , a millennium old warrior .
as you take control of the character the transition from cut scene to play is seamless , and the quality of the graphics continues .
like blue dragon , the gaming is menu-based , meaning that you must choose the correct action or object for kain before it can be used .
this can be frustrating at times as it interrupts the gameplay , but is part and parcel of a lot of the rpg genre .
the sequence ends with a meteor impact that destroys kain 's opponents in a flood of realistically rendered molten rock .
sakaguchi has said that a lot of the game will be seen through kain 's dreams and memories , but whether the demo sequence on show was one of these will not be known until the game is released next year .

gamers will have to wait for gt5 for an entirely new experience .
however , both feature new customisation options .
rr7 allows gamers to tinker with their cars and adjust the car 's ride and even the interior of their cars , while gthd exploits the ps3s online capability , allowing gamers to buy new cars and tracks .

by dominic casciani bbc news community affairs david pawlak : swapped teaching for leafleting and tripled his salary if there was ever any doubt that the uk is in the grips of an extraordinary revolution , then hunt out the migrant worker recruitment fairs that are starting to spring up .
last month , thousands of young polish workers turned up at the third recruitment fair hosted by polish express , the london-based newspaper for the diaspora .
just as its circulation is growing by the month , so its jobs fair gets bigger each time it is held .
this time , there were some 5,000 polish people queuing patiently in a west london suburb for a chance to hand over a cv to 40 employment agencies .
as they queued to enter the hall that was filled to its legal safety capacity , they scribbled away at resumes , going over their pitch time and time again .
most were in their mid-20s .
some had only recently arrived , having stuffed a few belongings into a backpack , bought a one-way no-frills airline ticket .
like dick whittington so many centuries before , were they expecting streets paved with gold ?
positions vacant : thousands turned out for fair enthusiastically handing out flyers for a money transfer company was david pawlak , a 26-year-old from near warsaw .
back home in poland , david was a teacher , taking home the equivalent of £ 200 a month .
but thrusting flyers nets him £ 600 .
" i 've got no idea how long i am going to stay , " said david , " but i 'm earning so much more i now know why so many people are doing it .
my sister came first and suggested that i follow .
i 'm living pretty cheaply with her at the moment .
" the papers back home are talking about how so many people have come to england to work .
but people also want to live a little - that 's what i am here to do . "
key statistics 427,000 workers from eight eu accession states successfully applied for work in uk over half -lrb- 62 % -rrb- are polish 82 % are aged 18-34 56 % work in factories * anglia region has highest proportion of workers -lrb- 15 % -rrb- source : home office all figures may 2004-jun 2006 except * jul 2004-jun 2006 facts and figures two years ago , this was a hidden revolution ; most of the eastern european workers in the uk were in industries far removed from sight , food processing and seasonal agriculture work .
today employers in more and more sectors have latched on to the idea of picking up cheap eastern european workers .
and so inside the recruitment fair there were agencies from the length and breadth of the uk , many of them from the north , offering work in everything from catering and hospitality to care services , clerical , technical and engineering .
one of the most specialist agencies recruits marine engineers .
next door was pub chain weatherspoons , where poles have begun to challenge the long-established supremacy of the aussie barman .
clearly , it was n't just the candidates who were eager .
those with fluent english were doing best - but many agencies had got round that problem by employing other poles to translate .
from recruited to recruiter anna misiuva arrived from southern poland in march to join her husband who was already working here .
she now works for recruitment agency randstad and helps to place eastern european workers in the south-east .
so what kinds of jobs are people going to ?
anna misiuva : recruiting with colleague chidima nduka " they 've got to have a minimum of english , " she said .
" our clients are looking for people who can work constantly , rather than on short-term contracts .
" the work can be difficult - sometimes it 's a job in the food industry where people are working up to 10 hours in a chiller , for instance .
" with one of our clients -lsb- in the chilled food industry -rsb- , most of the workforce are lithuanian , some are indian .
none of them are british . "
that willingness to do jobs that employers say british workers do n't want , was at the heart of the boom , said bob owen of polcat , a doncaster safety training firm targeting the polish employees market .
" i must admit it , i have never seen a workforce like the poles , " said mr owen .
" they want to work , you can see it in their eyes .
but here 's the thing - they 're not in competition with the british workforce - they are finding ways of fulfilling a need that just was n't being met and that 's why they are being welcomed . "
adam and sandra : here for the long-term while the first wave of eastern european workers went into construction and the food industry , people are increasingly looking at a more diverse range of careers .
adam pawlik , resident four months , had just been joined by his girlfriend sandra lewandowska .
urbane and softly-spoken with a mid-atlantic twang , adam was typical of many of those now arriving .
" office jobs , " said adam .
" i was studying architecture before i came over - i actually want to go to university here eventually .
so we 're not desperate , we wo n't just take anything that we are offered . "
so this is long-term ?
" yes absolutely .
i just do n't see any chances for us in poland , " said adam .
" back home things are terrible .
do you know what a mess they have made of the place ?
" we came here to look for a better future for us - perhaps for our kids one day , " he added with a cheeky smile .
sandra raised her eyebrows and ribbed him .
" in any case , we 're planning to stay , " she added .
come back during this week for more stories about eastern european migrant life in britain .

by dominic casciani bbc news community affairs david pawlak : swapped teaching for leafleting and tripled his salary if there was ever any doubt that the uk is in the grips of an extraordinary revolution , then hunt out the migrant worker recruitment fairs that are starting to spring up .
last month , thousands of young polish workers turned up at the third recruitment fair hosted by polish express , the london-based newspaper for the diaspora .
just as its circulation is growing by the month , so its jobs fair gets bigger each time it is held .
this time , there were some 5,000 polish people queuing patiently in a west london suburb for a chance to hand over a cv to 40 employment agencies .
as they queued to enter the hall that was filled to its legal safety capacity , they scribbled away at resumes , going over their pitch time and time again .
most were in their mid-20s .
some had only recently arrived , having stuffed a few belongings into a backpack , bought a one-way no-frills airline ticket .
like dick whittington so many centuries before , were they expecting streets paved with gold ?
positions vacant : thousands turned out for fair enthusiastically handing out flyers for a money transfer company was david pawlak , a 26-year-old from near warsaw .
back home in poland , david was a teacher , taking home the equivalent of £ 200 a month .
but thrusting flyers nets him £ 600 .
" i 've got no idea how long i am going to stay , " said david , " but i 'm earning so much more i now know why so many people are doing it .
my sister came first and suggested that i follow .
i 'm living pretty cheaply with her at the moment .
" the papers back home are talking about how so many people have come to england to work .
but people also want to live a little - that 's what i am here to do . "
key statistics 427,000 workers from eight eu accession states successfully applied for work in uk over half -lrb- 62 % -rrb- are polish 82 % are aged 18-34 56 % work in factories * anglia region has highest proportion of workers -lrb- 15 % -rrb- source : home office all figures may 2004-jun 2006 except * jul 2004-jun 2006 facts and figures two years ago , this was a hidden revolution ; most of the eastern european workers in the uk were in industries far removed from sight , food processing and seasonal agriculture work .
today employers in more and more sectors have latched on to the idea of picking up cheap eastern european workers .
and so inside the recruitment fair there were agencies from the length and breadth of the uk , many of them from the north , offering work in everything from catering and hospitality to care services , clerical , technical and engineering .
one of the most specialist agencies recruits marine engineers .
next door was pub chain weatherspoons , where poles have begun to challenge the long-established supremacy of the aussie barman .
clearly , it was n't just the candidates who were eager .
those with fluent english were doing best - but many agencies had got round that problem by employing other poles to translate .
from recruited to recruiter anna misiuva arrived from southern poland in march to join her husband who was already working here .
she now works for recruitment agency randstad and helps to place eastern european workers in the south-east .
so what kinds of jobs are people going to ?
anna misiuva : recruiting with colleague chidima nduka " they 've got to have a minimum of english , " she said .
" our clients are looking for people who can work constantly , rather than on short-term contracts .
" the work can be difficult - sometimes it 's a job in the food industry where people are working up to 10 hours in a chiller , for instance .
" with one of our clients -lsb- in the chilled food industry -rsb- , most of the workforce are lithuanian , some are indian .
none of them are british . "
that willingness to do jobs that employers say british workers do n't want , was at the heart of the boom , said bob owen of polcat , a doncaster safety training firm targeting the polish employees market .
" i must admit it , i have never seen a workforce like the poles , " said mr owen .
" they want to work , you can see it in their eyes .
but here 's the thing - they 're not in competition with the british workforce - they are finding ways of fulfilling a need that just was n't being met and that 's why they are being welcomed . "
adam and sandra : here for the long-term while the first wave of eastern european workers went into construction and the food industry , people are increasingly looking at a more diverse range of careers .
adam pawlik , resident four months , had just been joined by his girlfriend sandra lewandowska .
urbane and softly-spoken with a mid-atlantic twang , adam was typical of many of those now arriving .
" office jobs , " said adam .
" i was studying architecture before i came over - i actually want to go to university here eventually .
so we 're not desperate , we wo n't just take anything that we are offered . "
so this is long-term ?
" yes absolutely .
i just do n't see any chances for us in poland , " said adam .
" back home things are terrible .
