even mehmet aydin , the minister of religious affairs will be headed to the pope 's native germany , leaving the task of receiving benedict in istanbul to erdogan 's deputy , mehmet ali sahin . in addition to the less than high-level official reception , protesters in istanbul this week rallied against the pontiff 's visit , drawing tens of thousands of demonstrators . one speaker was cheered when he described the pope as the enemy of all muslims and proclaimed that he should never be allowed to enter a muslim country . tens of thousands protest papal visit " the pope is coming and yet he said such terrible things about our most sacred prophet , " the speaker said .
" we do n't want this bad and dangerous man here .
we are here to defend our homeland , our nation and our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's remarks about islam drew ire among many muslims the protestor was referring to remarks benedict , the former joseph ratzinger , had made at a lecture at the university of regensburg , in his native bavaria in september , in which he made reference to a 14th century byzantine emperor , who had characterized the teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " although the pope swiftly expressed regret for the flap , his remarks infuriated many muslims .
before being elected pope , benedict had also offended the turks for his stance against their country 's bid to join the european union , saying that its population of mainly sunni muslims did not belong to europe either culturally or religiously . dialogue to re-establish ties with orthodox christian churches one of the main goals of the pope 's visit is to re-establish ties with ecumenical patriarch bartholomew , the spiritual head of the world 's orthodox christians . the vatican has been estranged from this eastern branch of christianity since the schism of 1054 , which was followed by a long feud over liturgical differences and papal supremacy . istanbul , formerly constantinople , was the capital of the greek-speaking byzantine empire before being overtaken by the muslim turks in 1453 . " the pope 's visit is an expression of the desire for unity , but it is not easy to resolve some of the issues dividing us , " archbishop demetrius , head of the greek orthodox church in the united states , told reuters .
" with such a long history of separation , you can not move in a big jump .
you need a methodical , step-by-step approach , " said demetrius , who will be in istanbul for the papal visit . unlike roman catholics , orthodox christians maintain a loose diaspora of churches around the world , which are mostly based in greece , russia , armenia and the balkan states .
only a tiny minority of turkey 's population is christian . security tight during benedict 's three-day visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish riot police disperse protesters in istanbul at a 2005 women 's rights march turkey 's security forces said they wo n't be taking chances during the papal visit , which will involve over 30,000 police , bomb disposal experts as well as unprecedented air and sea surveillance . more police will protect pope benedict xvi when he visits turkey than were deployed for us president george w. bush , turkish foreign minister abdullah gul announced sunday . " the security measures being taken for the pope in turkey are higher than taken for george w. bush , " gul said in an interview with the italian daily corriere della sera . the police will also be monitoring groups hostile to the pope , such as the lawyer kemal kerincsiz , a leading member of an ultra-nationalist movement , who is still working hard to force a cancellation . " the pope 's visit is the biggest danger facing turkey , " kerincsiz said .
" it will constitute a great step in uniting the two main christian churches .
if this occurs , the christians will then try and create a state within istanbul like the vatican . " although such rhetoric is somewhat far-reaching , kerincsiz 's words strike a chord among many turks in a climate of growing anti-european sentiment .
however , at orthodox churches across turkey , prayers are being said for benedict 's forthcoming visit .
patriarch bartholomew has stressed that the pope 's trip will be a chance to show the world a modern , tolerant turkey . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de erdogan chooses nato over pope in apparent snub to pontiff already facing a potential storm of protests when he visits turkey later this month , pope benedict will not be recieved by the turkish prime minister in what the italian press were calling a major snub to the pontiff .

even mehmet aydin , the minister of religious affairs will be headed to the pope 's native germany , leaving the task of receiving benedict in istanbul to erdogan 's deputy , mehmet ali sahin . in addition to the less than high-level official reception , protesters in istanbul this week rallied against the pontiff 's visit , drawing tens of thousands of demonstrators . one speaker was cheered when he described the pope as the enemy of all muslims and proclaimed that he should never be allowed to enter a muslim country . tens of thousands protest papal visit " the pope is coming and yet he said such terrible things about our most sacred prophet , " the speaker said .
" we do n't want this bad and dangerous man here .
we are here to defend our homeland , our nation and our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's remarks about islam drew ire among many muslims the protestor was referring to remarks benedict , the former joseph ratzinger , had made at a lecture at the university of regensburg , in his native bavaria in september , in which he made reference to a 14th century byzantine emperor , who had characterized the teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " although the pope swiftly expressed regret for the flap , his remarks infuriated many muslims .
before being elected pope , benedict had also offended the turks for his stance against their country 's bid to join the european union , saying that its population of mainly sunni muslims did not belong to europe either culturally or religiously . dialogue to re-establish ties with orthodox christian churches one of the main goals of the pope 's visit is to re-establish ties with ecumenical patriarch bartholomew , the spiritual head of the world 's orthodox christians . the vatican has been estranged from this eastern branch of christianity since the schism of 1054 , which was followed by a long feud over liturgical differences and papal supremacy . istanbul , formerly constantinople , was the capital of the greek-speaking byzantine empire before being overtaken by the muslim turks in 1453 . " the pope 's visit is an expression of the desire for unity , but it is not easy to resolve some of the issues dividing us , " archbishop demetrius , head of the greek orthodox church in the united states , told reuters .
" with such a long history of separation , you can not move in a big jump .
you need a methodical , step-by-step approach , " said demetrius , who will be in istanbul for the papal visit . unlike roman catholics , orthodox christians maintain a loose diaspora of churches around the world , which are mostly based in greece , russia , armenia and the balkan states .
only a tiny minority of turkey 's population is christian . security tight during benedict 's three-day visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish riot police disperse protesters in istanbul at a 2005 women 's rights march turkey 's security forces said they wo n't be taking chances during the papal visit , which will involve over 30,000 police , bomb disposal experts as well as unprecedented air and sea surveillance . more police will protect pope benedict xvi when he visits turkey than were deployed for us president george w. bush , turkish foreign minister abdullah gul announced sunday . " the security measures being taken for the pope in turkey are higher than taken for george w. bush , " gul said in an interview with the italian daily corriere della sera . the police will also be monitoring groups hostile to the pope , such as the lawyer kemal kerincsiz , a leading member of an ultra-nationalist movement , who is still working hard to force a cancellation . " the pope 's visit is the biggest danger facing turkey , " kerincsiz said .
" it will constitute a great step in uniting the two main christian churches .
if this occurs , the christians will then try and create a state within istanbul like the vatican . " although such rhetoric is somewhat far-reaching , kerincsiz 's words strike a chord among many turks in a climate of growing anti-european sentiment .
however , at orthodox churches across turkey , prayers are being said for benedict 's forthcoming visit .
patriarch bartholomew has stressed that the pope 's trip will be a chance to show the world a modern , tolerant turkey . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de erdogan chooses nato over pope in apparent snub to pontiff already facing a potential storm of protests when he visits turkey later this month , pope benedict will not be recieved by the turkish prime minister in what the italian press were calling a major snub to the pontiff .

" all the resolutions will show that the cdu is a people 's party of the center , " the chancellor said during a tour of the congress hall in the eastern city of dresden on sunday afternoon . the run-up to the gathering was overshadowed by a dispute over what direction the party should take after its first 12 months in government , following seven years in opposition . powerful rivals to merkel want the conservative cdu to adopt a more socially-oriented profile , while other key members have warned against taking a turn to the left . in her address , merkel is expected to underscore the cdu 's position as a centrist party of different streams , encompassing christian social values , economic liberalism and conservatism . who benefits from grand coalition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrated the grand coalition 's first anniversary this week some critics of the chancellor claim the measures adopted by her government over the past year bear more the stamp of the cdu 's center-left coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . despite a buoyant economy that has helped create more jobs , merkel has seen her popularity slump , with opinion polls showing more than two thirds of germans dissatisfied with the performance of her government . one of the supporters of a more socially-oriented cdu is jürgen rüttgers , premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , and a potential rival to merkel in a future contest for the party leadership . rüttgers surprised the party last month with a controversial proposal that older people out of out work should receive unemployment benefit over a longer period than younger workers made redundant . caution against moving too far to the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel have to make room for rüttgers at the next election ?
rüttgers argued that older workers had contributed more to the state unemployment fund over the years than younger ones and should therefore get more out of it . on the other side of the political spectrum is the cdu 's business-oriented wing led by günther oettinger , prime minister of baden württemberg , where daimlerchrysler has its headquarters . oettinger has cautioned the party against moving to the left and wants do see germany 's strict rules on employment protection loosened in order to make it easier for firms to hire and fire , saying this will create more jobs . foreign topics include eu expansion , afghanistan in tuesday 's debate on foreign policy , the party is expected to call for a freeze on european union enlargement after bulgaria and romania join in january - at least until the moribund eu constitution is approved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of german troops in afghanistan will be a topic at the cdu meeting delegates could make an exception for croatia , but would underscore their view that turkey be granted associate status instead of the full eu membership that ankara hopes for , party sources said . afghanistan is likely to be a hotly debated issue , following calls by fellow nato members for germany to take on a more active role in the troubled south where intense fighting has been going on with remnants of the ousted taliban regime . germany has been successful with its provincial reconstruction teams of mixed military and civil groups in the relatively quiet north and is reluctant to dispatch troops to the south . germany has around 2,900 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : nato needs to discuss more than troop deployments less than a week before the nato summit in riga , german chancellor angela merkel has restated her opposition to sending german troops to afghanistan 's volatile south .

even mehmet aydin , the minister of religious affairs will be headed to the pope 's native germany , leaving the task of receiving benedict in istanbul to erdogan 's deputy , mehmet ali sahin . in addition to the less than high-level official reception , protesters in istanbul this week rallied against the pontiff 's visit , drawing tens of thousands of demonstrators . one speaker was cheered when he described the pope as the enemy of all muslims and proclaimed that he should never be allowed to enter a muslim country . tens of thousands protest papal visit " the pope is coming and yet he said such terrible things about our most sacred prophet , " the speaker said .
" we do n't want this bad and dangerous man here .
we are here to defend our homeland , our nation and our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's remarks about islam drew ire among many muslims the protestor was referring to remarks benedict , the former joseph ratzinger , had made at a lecture at the university of regensburg , in his native bavaria in september , in which he made reference to a 14th century byzantine emperor , who had characterized the teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " although the pope swiftly expressed regret for the flap , his remarks infuriated many muslims .
before being elected pope , benedict had also offended the turks for his stance against their country 's bid to join the european union , saying that its population of mainly sunni muslims did not belong to europe either culturally or religiously . dialogue to re-establish ties with orthodox christian churches one of the main goals of the pope 's visit is to re-establish ties with ecumenical patriarch bartholomew , the spiritual head of the world 's orthodox christians . the vatican has been estranged from this eastern branch of christianity since the schism of 1054 , which was followed by a long feud over liturgical differences and papal supremacy . istanbul , formerly constantinople , was the capital of the greek-speaking byzantine empire before being overtaken by the muslim turks in 1453 . " the pope 's visit is an expression of the desire for unity , but it is not easy to resolve some of the issues dividing us , " archbishop demetrius , head of the greek orthodox church in the united states , told reuters .
" with such a long history of separation , you can not move in a big jump .
you need a methodical , step-by-step approach , " said demetrius , who will be in istanbul for the papal visit . unlike roman catholics , orthodox christians maintain a loose diaspora of churches around the world , which are mostly based in greece , russia , armenia and the balkan states .
only a tiny minority of turkey 's population is christian . security tight during benedict 's three-day visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish riot police disperse protesters in istanbul at a 2005 women 's rights march turkey 's security forces said they wo n't be taking chances during the papal visit , which will involve over 30,000 police , bomb disposal experts as well as unprecedented air and sea surveillance . more police will protect pope benedict xvi when he visits turkey than were deployed for us president george w. bush , turkish foreign minister abdullah gul announced sunday . " the security measures being taken for the pope in turkey are higher than taken for george w. bush , " gul said in an interview with the italian daily corriere della sera . the police will also be monitoring groups hostile to the pope , such as the lawyer kemal kerincsiz , a leading member of an ultra-nationalist movement , who is still working hard to force a cancellation . " the pope 's visit is the biggest danger facing turkey , " kerincsiz said .
" it will constitute a great step in uniting the two main christian churches .
if this occurs , the christians will then try and create a state within istanbul like the vatican . " although such rhetoric is somewhat far-reaching , kerincsiz 's words strike a chord among many turks in a climate of growing anti-european sentiment .

" all the resolutions will show that the cdu is a people 's party of the center , " the chancellor said during a tour of the congress hall in the eastern city of dresden on sunday afternoon . the run-up to the gathering was overshadowed by a dispute over what direction the party should take after its first 12 months in government , following seven years in opposition . powerful rivals to merkel want the conservative cdu to adopt a more socially-oriented profile , while other key members have warned against taking a turn to the left . in her address , merkel is expected to underscore the cdu 's position as a centrist party of different streams , encompassing christian social values , economic liberalism and conservatism . who benefits from grand coalition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrated the grand coalition 's first anniversary this week some critics of the chancellor claim the measures adopted by her government over the past year bear more the stamp of the cdu 's center-left coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . despite a buoyant economy that has helped create more jobs , merkel has seen her popularity slump , with opinion polls showing more than two thirds of germans dissatisfied with the performance of her government . one of the supporters of a more socially-oriented cdu is jürgen rüttgers , premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , and a potential rival to merkel in a future contest for the party leadership . rüttgers surprised the party last month with a controversial proposal that older people out of out work should receive unemployment benefit over a longer period than younger workers made redundant . caution against moving too far to the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel have to make room for rüttgers at the next election ?

16 , springer announced it was taking a 25-percent stake in the turkish broadcaster dogan tv , the parent company of which has other media interests , such as the newspapers hurriyet and milliyet . a week later , on nov .
23 , the german group then said it was in talks to buy a 25.1-percent stake in polish television company polsat . already successful in polish print media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles will soon see springer productions on tv as well as in the paper springer has already successfully established itself in poland via its mass-circulation daily fakt and the more high-brow publication , dziennik . by itself , the move into polish television " makes sense , we see it as an interesting investment , " said springer spokeswoman edda fels . the publishing company could use its existing printed media activities there to forge a link between the printed and television media , a strategy that has long been an ambition of chief executive mathias döpfner , who masterminded the original plans to buy prosiebensat1 , germany 's biggest free-to-air broadcaster . döpfner has insisted that " we do n't need a substitute " for prosiebensat1 , and that springer would forge ahead with growth , seizing all strategic and investment opportunities as they presented themselves . aside from fakt and dziennik in poland , axel springer has launched various foreign-language versions of its best-selling german publications , such as computer bild in russia and auto bild in azerbaijan . french bild also in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer is hoping the french bild will become as popular as baguettes the group now generates 16 percent of its revenues abroad , a trend that is rising . nevertheless , springer 's preparations to launch a french bild , now at an advanced stage , represents a change in direction , since the target market is not central and eastern europe , but a mature market much bigger in size than poland or hungary . springer hopes the french bild , which so far has not been given an official name , will repeat the success of fakt in poland . launched in 2003 , fakt quickly became the country 's most widely-read newspaper . earlier this week , springer said that the financing for a french editorial team was already in place and the final decision regarding the timetable for the launch would be made next year . markets likely to smile on springer all this frenetic activity is likely to be good for axel springer , according to industry experts . the group 's main outside shareholder , us private equity group hellman and friedman , plans to sell a 10-percent stake in the newspaper publisher via the open market by the end of the year , depending on market conditions . hellman and friedman specializes in investments in media and new technologies and holds 19.4 percent of springer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair the frankfurt book fair has turned into more of a media market , over the years .

" all the resolutions will show that the cdu is a people 's party of the center , " the chancellor said during a tour of the congress hall in the eastern city of dresden on sunday afternoon . the run-up to the gathering was overshadowed by a dispute over what direction the party should take after its first 12 months in government , following seven years in opposition . powerful rivals to merkel want the conservative cdu to adopt a more socially-oriented profile , while other key members have warned against taking a turn to the left . in her address , merkel is expected to underscore the cdu 's position as a centrist party of different streams , encompassing christian social values , economic liberalism and conservatism . who benefits from grand coalition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrated the grand coalition 's first anniversary this week some critics of the chancellor claim the measures adopted by her government over the past year bear more the stamp of the cdu 's center-left coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . despite a buoyant economy that has helped create more jobs , merkel has seen her popularity slump , with opinion polls showing more than two thirds of germans dissatisfied with the performance of her government . one of the supporters of a more socially-oriented cdu is jürgen rüttgers , premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , and a potential rival to merkel in a future contest for the party leadership . rüttgers surprised the party last month with a controversial proposal that older people out of out work should receive unemployment benefit over a longer period than younger workers made redundant . caution against moving too far to the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel have to make room for rüttgers at the next election ?
rüttgers argued that older workers had contributed more to the state unemployment fund over the years than younger ones and should therefore get more out of it . on the other side of the political spectrum is the cdu 's business-oriented wing led by günther oettinger , prime minister of baden württemberg , where daimlerchrysler has its headquarters . oettinger has cautioned the party against moving to the left and wants do see germany 's strict rules on employment protection loosened in order to make it easier for firms to hire and fire , saying this will create more jobs . foreign topics include eu expansion , afghanistan in tuesday 's debate on foreign policy , the party is expected to call for a freeze on european union enlargement after bulgaria and romania join in january - at least until the moribund eu constitution is approved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of german troops in afghanistan will be a topic at the cdu meeting delegates could make an exception for croatia , but would underscore their view that turkey be granted associate status instead of the full eu membership that ankara hopes for , party sources said . afghanistan is likely to be a hotly debated issue , following calls by fellow nato members for germany to take on a more active role in the troubled south where intense fighting has been going on with remnants of the ousted taliban regime . germany has been successful with its provincial reconstruction teams of mixed military and civil groups in the relatively quiet north and is reluctant to dispatch troops to the south . germany has around 2,900 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : nato needs to discuss more than troop deployments less than a week before the nato summit in riga , german chancellor angela merkel has restated her opposition to sending german troops to afghanistan 's volatile south .

23 , the german group then said it was in talks to buy a 25.1-percent stake in polish television company polsat . already successful in polish print media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles will soon see springer productions on tv as well as in the paper springer has already successfully established itself in poland via its mass-circulation daily fakt and the more high-brow publication , dziennik . by itself , the move into polish television " makes sense , we see it as an interesting investment , " said springer spokeswoman edda fels . the publishing company could use its existing printed media activities there to forge a link between the printed and television media , a strategy that has long been an ambition of chief executive mathias döpfner , who masterminded the original plans to buy prosiebensat1 , germany 's biggest free-to-air broadcaster . döpfner has insisted that " we do n't need a substitute " for prosiebensat1 , and that springer would forge ahead with growth , seizing all strategic and investment opportunities as they presented themselves . aside from fakt and dziennik in poland , axel springer has launched various foreign-language versions of its best-selling german publications , such as computer bild in russia and auto bild in azerbaijan . french bild also in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer is hoping the french bild will become as popular as baguettes the group now generates 16 percent of its revenues abroad , a trend that is rising . nevertheless , springer 's preparations to launch a french bild , now at an advanced stage , represents a change in direction , since the target market is not central and eastern europe , but a mature market much bigger in size than poland or hungary . springer hopes the french bild , which so far has not been given an official name , will repeat the success of fakt in poland . launched in 2003 , fakt quickly became the country 's most widely-read newspaper . earlier this week , springer said that the financing for a french editorial team was already in place and the final decision regarding the timetable for the launch would be made next year . markets likely to smile on springer all this frenetic activity is likely to be good for axel springer , according to industry experts . the group 's main outside shareholder , us private equity group hellman and friedman , plans to sell a 10-percent stake in the newspaper publisher via the open market by the end of the year , depending on market conditions . hellman and friedman specializes in investments in media and new technologies and holds 19.4 percent of springer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair the frankfurt book fair has turned into more of a media market , over the years .

" all the resolutions will show that the cdu is a people 's party of the center , " the chancellor said during a tour of the congress hall in the eastern city of dresden on sunday afternoon . the run-up to the gathering was overshadowed by a dispute over what direction the party should take after its first 12 months in government , following seven years in opposition . powerful rivals to merkel want the conservative cdu to adopt a more socially-oriented profile , while other key members have warned against taking a turn to the left . in her address , merkel is expected to underscore the cdu 's position as a centrist party of different streams , encompassing christian social values , economic liberalism and conservatism . who benefits from grand coalition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrated the grand coalition 's first anniversary this week some critics of the chancellor claim the measures adopted by her government over the past year bear more the stamp of the cdu 's center-left coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . despite a buoyant economy that has helped create more jobs , merkel has seen her popularity slump , with opinion polls showing more than two thirds of germans dissatisfied with the performance of her government . one of the supporters of a more socially-oriented cdu is jürgen rüttgers , premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , and a potential rival to merkel in a future contest for the party leadership . rüttgers surprised the party last month with a controversial proposal that older people out of out work should receive unemployment benefit over a longer period than younger workers made redundant . caution against moving too far to the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel have to make room for rüttgers at the next election ?
rüttgers argued that older workers had contributed more to the state unemployment fund over the years than younger ones and should therefore get more out of it . on the other side of the political spectrum is the cdu 's business-oriented wing led by günther oettinger , prime minister of baden württemberg , where daimlerchrysler has its headquarters . oettinger has cautioned the party against moving to the left and wants do see germany 's strict rules on employment protection loosened in order to make it easier for firms to hire and fire , saying this will create more jobs . foreign topics include eu expansion , afghanistan in tuesday 's debate on foreign policy , the party is expected to call for a freeze on european union enlargement after bulgaria and romania join in january - at least until the moribund eu constitution is approved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of german troops in afghanistan will be a topic at the cdu meeting delegates could make an exception for croatia , but would underscore their view that turkey be granted associate status instead of the full eu membership that ankara hopes for , party sources said . afghanistan is likely to be a hotly debated issue , following calls by fellow nato members for germany to take on a more active role in the troubled south where intense fighting has been going on with remnants of the ousted taliban regime . germany has been successful with its provincial reconstruction teams of mixed military and civil groups in the relatively quiet north and is reluctant to dispatch troops to the south . germany has around 2,900 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : nato needs to discuss more than troop deployments less than a week before the nato summit in riga , german chancellor angela merkel has restated her opposition to sending german troops to afghanistan 's volatile south .

16 , springer announced it was taking a 25-percent stake in the turkish broadcaster dogan tv , the parent company of which has other media interests , such as the newspapers hurriyet and milliyet . a week later , on nov .

" all the resolutions will show that the cdu is a people 's party of the center , " the chancellor said during a tour of the congress hall in the eastern city of dresden on sunday afternoon . the run-up to the gathering was overshadowed by a dispute over what direction the party should take after its first 12 months in government , following seven years in opposition . powerful rivals to merkel want the conservative cdu to adopt a more socially-oriented profile , while other key members have warned against taking a turn to the left . in her address , merkel is expected to underscore the cdu 's position as a centrist party of different streams , encompassing christian social values , economic liberalism and conservatism . who benefits from grand coalition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrated the grand coalition 's first anniversary this week some critics of the chancellor claim the measures adopted by her government over the past year bear more the stamp of the cdu 's center-left coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . despite a buoyant economy that has helped create more jobs , merkel has seen her popularity slump , with opinion polls showing more than two thirds of germans dissatisfied with the performance of her government . one of the supporters of a more socially-oriented cdu is jürgen rüttgers , premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , and a potential rival to merkel in a future contest for the party leadership . rüttgers surprised the party last month with a controversial proposal that older people out of out work should receive unemployment benefit over a longer period than younger workers made redundant . caution against moving too far to the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel have to make room for rüttgers at the next election ?
rüttgers argued that older workers had contributed more to the state unemployment fund over the years than younger ones and should therefore get more out of it . on the other side of the political spectrum is the cdu 's business-oriented wing led by günther oettinger , prime minister of baden württemberg , where daimlerchrysler has its headquarters . oettinger has cautioned the party against moving to the left and wants do see germany 's strict rules on employment protection loosened in order to make it easier for firms to hire and fire , saying this will create more jobs . foreign topics include eu expansion , afghanistan in tuesday 's debate on foreign policy , the party is expected to call for a freeze on european union enlargement after bulgaria and romania join in january - at least until the moribund eu constitution is approved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of german troops in afghanistan will be a topic at the cdu meeting delegates could make an exception for croatia , but would underscore their view that turkey be granted associate status instead of the full eu membership that ankara hopes for , party sources said . afghanistan is likely to be a hotly debated issue , following calls by fellow nato members for germany to take on a more active role in the troubled south where intense fighting has been going on with remnants of the ousted taliban regime . germany has been successful with its provincial reconstruction teams of mixed military and civil groups in the relatively quiet north and is reluctant to dispatch troops to the south . germany has around 2,900 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : nato needs to discuss more than troop deployments less than a week before the nato summit in riga , german chancellor angela merkel has restated her opposition to sending german troops to afghanistan 's volatile south .

" all the resolutions will show that the cdu is a people 's party of the center , " the chancellor said during a tour of the congress hall in the eastern city of dresden on sunday afternoon . the run-up to the gathering was overshadowed by a dispute over what direction the party should take after its first 12 months in government , following seven years in opposition . powerful rivals to merkel want the conservative cdu to adopt a more socially-oriented profile , while other key members have warned against taking a turn to the left . in her address , merkel is expected to underscore the cdu 's position as a centrist party of different streams , encompassing christian social values , economic liberalism and conservatism . who benefits from grand coalition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrated the grand coalition 's first anniversary this week some critics of the chancellor claim the measures adopted by her government over the past year bear more the stamp of the cdu 's center-left coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . despite a buoyant economy that has helped create more jobs , merkel has seen her popularity slump , with opinion polls showing more than two thirds of germans dissatisfied with the performance of her government . one of the supporters of a more socially-oriented cdu is jürgen rüttgers , premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , and a potential rival to merkel in a future contest for the party leadership . rüttgers surprised the party last month with a controversial proposal that older people out of out work should receive unemployment benefit over a longer period than younger workers made redundant . caution against moving too far to the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel have to make room for rüttgers at the next election ?
rüttgers argued that older workers had contributed more to the state unemployment fund over the years than younger ones and should therefore get more out of it . on the other side of the political spectrum is the cdu 's business-oriented wing led by günther oettinger , prime minister of baden württemberg , where daimlerchrysler has its headquarters . oettinger has cautioned the party against moving to the left and wants do see germany 's strict rules on employment protection loosened in order to make it easier for firms to hire and fire , saying this will create more jobs . foreign topics include eu expansion , afghanistan in tuesday 's debate on foreign policy , the party is expected to call for a freeze on european union enlargement after bulgaria and romania join in january - at least until the moribund eu constitution is approved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of german troops in afghanistan will be a topic at the cdu meeting delegates could make an exception for croatia , but would underscore their view that turkey be granted associate status instead of the full eu membership that ankara hopes for , party sources said . afghanistan is likely to be a hotly debated issue , following calls by fellow nato members for germany to take on a more active role in the troubled south where intense fighting has been going on with remnants of the ousted taliban regime . germany has been successful with its provincial reconstruction teams of mixed military and civil groups in the relatively quiet north and is reluctant to dispatch troops to the south . germany has around 2,900 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : nato needs to discuss more than troop deployments less than a week before the nato summit in riga , german chancellor angela merkel has restated her opposition to sending german troops to afghanistan 's volatile south .

" all the resolutions will show that the cdu is a people 's party of the center , " the chancellor said during a tour of the congress hall in the eastern city of dresden on sunday afternoon . the run-up to the gathering was overshadowed by a dispute over what direction the party should take after its first 12 months in government , following seven years in opposition . powerful rivals to merkel want the conservative cdu to adopt a more socially-oriented profile , while other key members have warned against taking a turn to the left . in her address , merkel is expected to underscore the cdu 's position as a centrist party of different streams , encompassing christian social values , economic liberalism and conservatism . who benefits from grand coalition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrated the grand coalition 's first anniversary this week some critics of the chancellor claim the measures adopted by her government over the past year bear more the stamp of the cdu 's center-left coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . despite a buoyant economy that has helped create more jobs , merkel has seen her popularity slump , with opinion polls showing more than two thirds of germans dissatisfied with the performance of her government . one of the supporters of a more socially-oriented cdu is jürgen rüttgers , premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , and a potential rival to merkel in a future contest for the party leadership . rüttgers surprised the party last month with a controversial proposal that older people out of out work should receive unemployment benefit over a longer period than younger workers made redundant . caution against moving too far to the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel have to make room for rüttgers at the next election ?

" all the resolutions will show that the cdu is a people 's party of the center , " the chancellor said during a tour of the congress hall in the eastern city of dresden on sunday afternoon . the run-up to the gathering was overshadowed by a dispute over what direction the party should take after its first 12 months in government , following seven years in opposition . powerful rivals to merkel want the conservative cdu to adopt a more socially-oriented profile , while other key members have warned against taking a turn to the left . in her address , merkel is expected to underscore the cdu 's position as a centrist party of different streams , encompassing christian social values , economic liberalism and conservatism . who benefits from grand coalition ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrated the grand coalition 's first anniversary this week some critics of the chancellor claim the measures adopted by her government over the past year bear more the stamp of the cdu 's center-left coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . despite a buoyant economy that has helped create more jobs , merkel has seen her popularity slump , with opinion polls showing more than two thirds of germans dissatisfied with the performance of her government . one of the supporters of a more socially-oriented cdu is jürgen rüttgers , premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , and a potential rival to merkel in a future contest for the party leadership . rüttgers surprised the party last month with a controversial proposal that older people out of out work should receive unemployment benefit over a longer period than younger workers made redundant . caution against moving too far to the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel have to make room for rüttgers at the next election ?
rüttgers argued that older workers had contributed more to the state unemployment fund over the years than younger ones and should therefore get more out of it . on the other side of the political spectrum is the cdu 's business-oriented wing led by günther oettinger , prime minister of baden württemberg , where daimlerchrysler has its headquarters . oettinger has cautioned the party against moving to the left and wants do see germany 's strict rules on employment protection loosened in order to make it easier for firms to hire and fire , saying this will create more jobs . foreign topics include eu expansion , afghanistan in tuesday 's debate on foreign policy , the party is expected to call for a freeze on european union enlargement after bulgaria and romania join in january - at least until the moribund eu constitution is approved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of german troops in afghanistan will be a topic at the cdu meeting delegates could make an exception for croatia , but would underscore their view that turkey be granted associate status instead of the full eu membership that ankara hopes for , party sources said . afghanistan is likely to be a hotly debated issue , following calls by fellow nato members for germany to take on a more active role in the troubled south where intense fighting has been going on with remnants of the ousted taliban regime . germany has been successful with its provincial reconstruction teams of mixed military and civil groups in the relatively quiet north and is reluctant to dispatch troops to the south . germany has around 2,900 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : nato needs to discuss more than troop deployments less than a week before the nato summit in riga , german chancellor angela merkel has restated her opposition to sending german troops to afghanistan 's volatile south .

even mehmet aydin , the minister of religious affairs will be headed to the pope 's native germany , leaving the task of receiving benedict in istanbul to erdogan 's deputy , mehmet ali sahin . in addition to the less than high-level official reception , protesters in istanbul this week rallied against the pontiff 's visit , drawing tens of thousands of demonstrators . one speaker was cheered when he described the pope as the enemy of all muslims and proclaimed that he should never be allowed to enter a muslim country . tens of thousands protest papal visit " the pope is coming and yet he said such terrible things about our most sacred prophet , " the speaker said .
" we do n't want this bad and dangerous man here .
we are here to defend our homeland , our nation and our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's remarks about islam drew ire among many muslims the protestor was referring to remarks benedict , the former joseph ratzinger , had made at a lecture at the university of regensburg , in his native bavaria in september , in which he made reference to a 14th century byzantine emperor , who had characterized the teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " although the pope swiftly expressed regret for the flap , his remarks infuriated many muslims .
before being elected pope , benedict had also offended the turks for his stance against their country 's bid to join the european union , saying that its population of mainly sunni muslims did not belong to europe either culturally or religiously . dialogue to re-establish ties with orthodox christian churches one of the main goals of the pope 's visit is to re-establish ties with ecumenical patriarch bartholomew , the spiritual head of the world 's orthodox christians . the vatican has been estranged from this eastern branch of christianity since the schism of 1054 , which was followed by a long feud over liturgical differences and papal supremacy . istanbul , formerly constantinople , was the capital of the greek-speaking byzantine empire before being overtaken by the muslim turks in 1453 . " the pope 's visit is an expression of the desire for unity , but it is not easy to resolve some of the issues dividing us , " archbishop demetrius , head of the greek orthodox church in the united states , told reuters .
" with such a long history of separation , you can not move in a big jump .
you need a methodical , step-by-step approach , " said demetrius , who will be in istanbul for the papal visit . unlike roman catholics , orthodox christians maintain a loose diaspora of churches around the world , which are mostly based in greece , russia , armenia and the balkan states .
only a tiny minority of turkey 's population is christian . security tight during benedict 's three-day visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish riot police disperse protesters in istanbul at a 2005 women 's rights march turkey 's security forces said they wo n't be taking chances during the papal visit , which will involve over 30,000 police , bomb disposal experts as well as unprecedented air and sea surveillance . more police will protect pope benedict xvi when he visits turkey than were deployed for us president george w. bush , turkish foreign minister abdullah gul announced sunday . " the security measures being taken for the pope in turkey are higher than taken for george w. bush , " gul said in an interview with the italian daily corriere della sera . the police will also be monitoring groups hostile to the pope , such as the lawyer kemal kerincsiz , a leading member of an ultra-nationalist movement , who is still working hard to force a cancellation . " the pope 's visit is the biggest danger facing turkey , " kerincsiz said .
" it will constitute a great step in uniting the two main christian churches .
if this occurs , the christians will then try and create a state within istanbul like the vatican . " although such rhetoric is somewhat far-reaching , kerincsiz 's words strike a chord among many turks in a climate of growing anti-european sentiment .
however , at orthodox churches across turkey , prayers are being said for benedict 's forthcoming visit .
patriarch bartholomew has stressed that the pope 's trip will be a chance to show the world a modern , tolerant turkey . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de erdogan chooses nato over pope in apparent snub to pontiff already facing a potential storm of protests when he visits turkey later this month , pope benedict will not be recieved by the turkish prime minister in what the italian press were calling a major snub to the pontiff .

even mehmet aydin , the minister of religious affairs will be headed to the pope 's native germany , leaving the task of receiving benedict in istanbul to erdogan 's deputy , mehmet ali sahin . in addition to the less than high-level official reception , protesters in istanbul this week rallied against the pontiff 's visit , drawing tens of thousands of demonstrators . one speaker was cheered when he described the pope as the enemy of all muslims and proclaimed that he should never be allowed to enter a muslim country . tens of thousands protest papal visit " the pope is coming and yet he said such terrible things about our most sacred prophet , " the speaker said .
" we do n't want this bad and dangerous man here .
we are here to defend our homeland , our nation and our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's remarks about islam drew ire among many muslims the protestor was referring to remarks benedict , the former joseph ratzinger , had made at a lecture at the university of regensburg , in his native bavaria in september , in which he made reference to a 14th century byzantine emperor , who had characterized the teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . " although the pope swiftly expressed regret for the flap , his remarks infuriated many muslims .
before being elected pope , benedict had also offended the turks for his stance against their country 's bid to join the european union , saying that its population of mainly sunni muslims did not belong to europe either culturally or religiously . dialogue to re-establish ties with orthodox christian churches one of the main goals of the pope 's visit is to re-establish ties with ecumenical patriarch bartholomew , the spiritual head of the world 's orthodox christians . the vatican has been estranged from this eastern branch of christianity since the schism of 1054 , which was followed by a long feud over liturgical differences and papal supremacy . istanbul , formerly constantinople , was the capital of the greek-speaking byzantine empire before being overtaken by the muslim turks in 1453 . " the pope 's visit is an expression of the desire for unity , but it is not easy to resolve some of the issues dividing us , " archbishop demetrius , head of the greek orthodox church in the united states , told reuters .
" with such a long history of separation , you can not move in a big jump .
you need a methodical , step-by-step approach , " said demetrius , who will be in istanbul for the papal visit . unlike roman catholics , orthodox christians maintain a loose diaspora of churches around the world , which are mostly based in greece , russia , armenia and the balkan states .
only a tiny minority of turkey 's population is christian . security tight during benedict 's three-day visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish riot police disperse protesters in istanbul at a 2005 women 's rights march turkey 's security forces said they wo n't be taking chances during the papal visit , which will involve over 30,000 police , bomb disposal experts as well as unprecedented air and sea surveillance . more police will protect pope benedict xvi when he visits turkey than were deployed for us president george w. bush , turkish foreign minister abdullah gul announced sunday . " the security measures being taken for the pope in turkey are higher than taken for george w. bush , " gul said in an interview with the italian daily corriere della sera . the police will also be monitoring groups hostile to the pope , such as the lawyer kemal kerincsiz , a leading member of an ultra-nationalist movement , who is still working hard to force a cancellation . " the pope 's visit is the biggest danger facing turkey , " kerincsiz said .
" it will constitute a great step in uniting the two main christian churches .
if this occurs , the christians will then try and create a state within istanbul like the vatican . " although such rhetoric is somewhat far-reaching , kerincsiz 's words strike a chord among many turks in a climate of growing anti-european sentiment .
however , at orthodox churches across turkey , prayers are being said for benedict 's forthcoming visit .
patriarch bartholomew has stressed that the pope 's trip will be a chance to show the world a modern , tolerant turkey . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de erdogan chooses nato over pope in apparent snub to pontiff already facing a potential storm of protests when he visits turkey later this month , pope benedict will not be recieved by the turkish prime minister in what the italian press were calling a major snub to the pontiff .

english church census figures show that half of priests ordained in recent years were women .
there were 1,262 serving women priests in 2002 .
university of manchester researchers say that , without women priests , pulpits would become " depopulated " .
the findings follow the archbishop of canterbury 's suggestion that they had failed to transform the church .
rowan williams , in an interview with the catholic herald newspaper earlier this month , said he did not think women priests - first ordained in 1994 - had " transformed or renewed the church in spectacular ways " nor had they " corrupted or ruined it " . "
women are not yet allowed to become bishops and they are far more likely to be ' second class ' clergy " david voas university of manchester the university of manchester 's david voas said : " close to a quarter of male parish priests are 60 or older and their average age is 54 .
" without women , the pulpits would become as depopulated as the pews in the years to come . "
it was not surprising women clergy seemed not to have made an impact because the church was " far from being an equal opportunity employer " , he added .
" women are not yet allowed to become bishops and they are far more likely to be ' second class ' clergy .
" most of the men who became priests in 2005 went into paid ' stipendiary ' ministry , while most of the women are in voluntary posts . "
archbishop 's apology other denominations were also more likely to favour male ministers over their female counterparts , he said .
the census found there were no women at all in churches which had congregations of 330 or more on a typical sunday .
" well over half of women ministers in all denominations serve in rural areas with very few found in the flagship city centre churches , " mr voas said .
" the larger the church , the more likely it is that a man will be put in charge . "
dr williams has apologised for how he phrased his recent comments about women priests .

i was a reporter for a sunday newspaper and i wrote then about seeing the stone of destiny making its way slowly up the cobbles inside a land rover .
at the time it was all a bit baffling ; the royal company of archers parading next to a big lump of stone and hundreds of soldiers on the royal mile .
why on earth was this happening ?
the stone had been taken to london in the 13th century by edward i , who had removed it from scone , the capital of the ancient pictish kingdom .
it it is believed to have been the coronation seat of scottish kings .
in 1296 it was placed beneath the coronation chair of westminster abbey .
seven hundred years later it was being returned to scotland .
another 10 years on and i 've been finding out how exactly did the stone come home ?
well , one man was key .
lord forsyth of drumlean .
in 1996 , michael forsyth was the conservative mp for stirling , the secretary of state for scotland ... and about to take everyone completely by surprise .
he had been approached about the possibility of releasing a series of government papers from the 1950s which showed that the cabinet had agreed to return the stone to scotland .
but it never happened .
if the papers were released , he calculated there would be an outcry from his political opponents .
he says he also believed bringing the stone home would be the right thing to do - in fact faced with these cabinet papers he told me it was " a no-brainer . "
but john major 's announcement to the house of commons on 3 july , 1996 certainly did n't please everyone .
especially at westminster abbey .
they were given just two days ' notice and had no time to protest at this historic flitting .
four months on from john major 's announcement and d-day was fixed for wednesday 13 november .
this was the last time tourists would ever see the stone of scone in the coronation chair - and the start of some painstaking work by historic scotland .
stoney faces six long hours after this painstaking work began - watched first by the dean of westminster , then with the canons and chaplain popping in and out - the stone eventually swung free and four men carried it out onto a motorised trolley where it was left until morning .
and then at 7am , watched by the dean and chapter dressed in red cassocks , black gowns and stoney faces , it was wheeled to the west door where a land rover and a police escort were waiting to carry the stone home .
and where exactly was home going to be in 1996 ?
a consultation exercise at the time came up with a range of possibles - the stuc wanted it to go to the site of any future parliament as did the then shadow scottish secretary george robertson .
there were bids for stirling castle , dunfermline abbey , and robbie the pict wanted it to go on tour across scotland .
viscount stormont , son of the earl of mansfield , though it should be brought to scone palace .
but he was to be disappointed .
the stone did n't head north to scone - it ended up at edinburgh castle where it can be seen today .
part of the arrangement , though , for sending the stone to scotland is that it will return for all future coronations .
and when it does head south at some point in the future that could open up a whole new chapter in the story of the stone .
you can hear the full story on when the stone came home , on bbc radio scotland at 1130 gmt on thursday 30 november .

the mail on sunday said accountants pricewaterhousecoopers were compiling a financial report that could help sell the aa to investors or buyers .
it said private equity owners cvc and permira wanted to raise £ 3bn -lrb- $ 5.8bn -rrb- for the 15 million-member business .
they bought the aa from british gas owner centrica in july 2004 for £ 1.7bn.
the takeover was followed by a major round of job cuts in a bid to improve the organisation 's profitability .
it shut its loss-making tyre-fitting unit and most of its vehicle-servicing centres , with the loss of 1,300 jobs .
history of the aa 1905 aa started with 100 members to help motorists avoid speed traps 1908 appoints agents and repairers throughout uk 1912 starts inspecting hotels 1920 starts car inspection service 1967 starts insurance broking service 1999 bought by centrica for £ 1.1bn 2004 sold by centrica for £ 1.75bn at the same time it also invested heavily in teleworking , and now has more than 300 former call-centre workers answering calls at home .

last week , ms jowell told the commons culture , media and sport committee that the expected cost had risen 40 % from £ 2.4bn since the right to stage the games was won in july 2005 .
' ludicrous situation ' the extra £ 900m was likely to be funded by london council tax payers and lottery funds , she suggested .
but mr livingstone said any increased costs were to do with infrastructure for new homes and that ms jowell had failed to take into account changes which had cut back the overall bill mr foster told gmtv : " there 's this ludicrous situation we 're got into with all these figures flying around .
" we have n't got a finalised budget , so everybody 's speculating .
" different government departments are arguing with each other and so nobody knows where we stand .
and confidence in our ability to deliver the olympics is sadly ebbing away when it 's going to be fantastic .
" we should be celebrating it ; i wish people frankly would shut up . "
council tax surcharge a row over the size of an olympics contingency fund and an unexpected vat bill have not yet been resolved .
the olympic park is being funded publicly , through a £ 20-a-year surcharge on each of london 's council tax payers for 12 years , and the national lottery .
regeneration is being funded through central government , while staging the games is being privately funded .
the lib dems and the conservatives have said parliament needs to scrutinise the costs - which they expect to rise further .
a revised financial plan is expected early next year .

the cut to funding for the canals and rivers -lrb- british waterways and environment agency -rrb- is not just about boaters but includes walkers , cyclists , fishermen / women and families just out for a stroll along the canal .
all of these activities may have to be restricted if the cuts are continued .
wildlife habitat could also be lost .
there is a great deal of flooding at the moment if funding is reduced this could be worse .
we -lrb- the nation -rrb- have over the last ten years or more managed to improve our waterways , are we going to let that be a waste of money and time .
if maintenance is not continued then the costs of repair in the future will be greater .
we must save our waterways for the future .
k makemson , england i would like to put forward a question regarding the replacement of schools with " acadamies " which was featured on the west midlands section of the politics show today .
my question is : talking about getting sponsors for these schools is all very well and good , but what happens to both the school -lrb- academy -rrb- and the children who attend if no sponsors come forward or suddenly decide to pull out for whatever reason ?
are these schools then going to close down ?
if so , what happens to the education of the children concerned ?
diane holland , brierley hill , west midlands dartmouth high school is scheduled to become an academy school .
during the planning it was decided that a perfectly good sports facility will be demolished to make way for the new build .
part of that facility is a fantastic swimming pool that has been serving the young people of great barr and surrounding areas for over 30 years .
the sandwell area is already deprived of good swimming facilities , however despite this fact and government policies it is ok to remove yet another facility .
in 5 - 10 years time when bodies are being pulled out of lakes and canals , who is going to take responsibly for lack of swimming lessons ?
unfortunately it will be too late for some children .
jan callow & helen clinton , uk your telephone messages : i do n't agree with city academies .
i think that sponsors will have control and convert pupils from christians to other faiths and vice versa .
to me it is all to do with religion rather than education .
mr davis , walsall i believe that education means preparation for life .
in real life young people should know how to live with people from different backgrounds and socio-economic groups but academies and trust schools will only be attended by pupils from well-off families .
the schools controlled by private sponsors will be extremely divisive .
tom , redditch it does n't matter to me whether there are academies or schools responsible for education .
teaching people will always be indoctrination to a certain extent anyway .
andrew , wolverhampton i am very concerned about the sponsors and their influence on children .
not every innovation is good and i think that we should stick to the education system we have .
mary , birmingham i am against the city academies .
i do n't understand why the head teacher of harborne hill school thinks that by putting his school into private sponsorship , this somehow will lead to innovation of curriculum .
why would we need to put his school and other schools into private hands ?
why this school should n't be publicly funded and publicly accountable .
why should we have a situation when we continue to pay publicly for these schools but the sponsors will control them ?
bill anderson , nut birmingham and on the cuts to the canal budget your comments are : all of my life i have had great pleasure walking along the canal system in coventry .
in all weather conditions it 's a fantastic way of escaping the rush of the traffic along the roads .
i remember the canals from the 1970 's which were polluted and the towpaths were falling apart .
what a crime it would be for the canals to return to this .
what a resource far from cutting money from the canals more should be invested ?

the cut to funding for the canals and rivers -lrb- british waterways and environment agency -rrb- is not just about boaters but includes walkers , cyclists , fishermen / women and families just out for a stroll along the canal .
all of these activities may have to be restricted if the cuts are continued .
wildlife habitat could also be lost .
there is a great deal of flooding at the moment if funding is reduced this could be worse .
we -lrb- the nation -rrb- have over the last ten years or more managed to improve our waterways , are we going to let that be a waste of money and time .
if maintenance is not continued then the costs of repair in the future will be greater .
we must save our waterways for the future .
k makemson , england i would like to put forward a question regarding the replacement of schools with " acadamies " which was featured on the west midlands section of the politics show today .
my question is : talking about getting sponsors for these schools is all very well and good , but what happens to both the school -lrb- academy -rrb- and the children who attend if no sponsors come forward or suddenly decide to pull out for whatever reason ?
are these schools then going to close down ?
if so , what happens to the education of the children concerned ?
diane holland , brierley hill , west midlands dartmouth high school is scheduled to become an academy school .
during the planning it was decided that a perfectly good sports facility will be demolished to make way for the new build .
part of that facility is a fantastic swimming pool that has been serving the young people of great barr and surrounding areas for over 30 years .
the sandwell area is already deprived of good swimming facilities , however despite this fact and government policies it is ok to remove yet another facility .
in 5 - 10 years time when bodies are being pulled out of lakes and canals , who is going to take responsibly for lack of swimming lessons ?
unfortunately it will be too late for some children .
jan callow & helen clinton , uk your telephone messages : i do n't agree with city academies .
i think that sponsors will have control and convert pupils from christians to other faiths and vice versa .
to me it is all to do with religion rather than education .
mr davis , walsall i believe that education means preparation for life .
in real life young people should know how to live with people from different backgrounds and socio-economic groups but academies and trust schools will only be attended by pupils from well-off families .
the schools controlled by private sponsors will be extremely divisive .
tom , redditch it does n't matter to me whether there are academies or schools responsible for education .
teaching people will always be indoctrination to a certain extent anyway .
andrew , wolverhampton i am very concerned about the sponsors and their influence on children .
not every innovation is good and i think that we should stick to the education system we have .
mary , birmingham i am against the city academies .
i do n't understand why the head teacher of harborne hill school thinks that by putting his school into private sponsorship , this somehow will lead to innovation of curriculum .
why would we need to put his school and other schools into private hands ?
why this school should n't be publicly funded and publicly accountable .
why should we have a situation when we continue to pay publicly for these schools but the sponsors will control them ?
bill anderson , nut birmingham and on the cuts to the canal budget your comments are : all of my life i have had great pleasure walking along the canal system in coventry .
in all weather conditions it 's a fantastic way of escaping the rush of the traffic along the roads .
i remember the canals from the 1970 's which were polluted and the towpaths were falling apart .
what a crime it would be for the canals to return to this .
what a resource far from cutting money from the canals more should be invested ?

liverpool vision has complained that developments , such as the 42-acre paradise project , are not visible on aerial view website google earth .
the site shows london landmarks such as the new wembley and arsenal fc stadia .
a spokeswoman for google earth said the site relies on external companies to provide the aerial views .
new buildings such as the birmingham selfridges and manchester 's one piccadilly tower have also been overlooked .
the city of manchester stadium , which hosted the 2002 commonwealth games and is now home to manchester city fc , is also shown as an area of waste land .
the actual view of liverpool waterfront is far more developed liverpool 's paradise project is a £ 900m retail and leisure development in the city centre .
the king 's dock arena - a new 10,000-seat arena on the waterfront - can not be seen on the website either .
jenny douglas , planning director of liverpool vision , said : " the current google earth images show roofing work still under way at lime street train station .
" this work took place between 2000 and 2001 , which means the google earth images are at least five years old .
" the city centre has changed dramatically since then .
it is important that the millions of people using google earth have access to the latest images showing the city 's transformation . "
the spokeswoman for google earth said images are updated as quickly as possible .
" we want to give the best service we can , and it would be wrong to delay updating the london images just because we ca n't do that yet for other cities , " she said .
