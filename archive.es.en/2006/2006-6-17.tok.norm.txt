" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .
portuguese soccer officials insisted that ronaldo was merely tired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's luis figo , left , and angola 's andre challenge for the ball but the portuguese can still count on a star line-up with deco - counted among the world 's best midfielders and nicknamed " the magic one " for his deadly free kicks and long passes - and captain luis figo , the two most experienced members of the team . figo , who turns 34 in november , proved his worth when he orchestrated the 1-0 win over angola by breaking through the defense to set up pauleta 's goal . portugal has its sights trained high for the world cup .

" i think they are ready to give a good effort . " giving no hints of the lineup changes he plans for saturday 's match , arena said he expects players to answer their wake-up call and play better then than they did in a 3-0 loss monday to the czech republic in a group e opener . us fears italian strikers " all we did is loose a game .
the challenge in any sport is how you respond , " arena said .
" naturally there is over-reaction in the short term .

" both are tremendous finishers .
gilardino is a lethal finisher inside the box and he is in position all the time , " arena said .
" they have an excellent midfield .
if they sit back , you need to be patient , pick your chances , not get caught on the break .
they are going to be selective on how they attack you . " the us need at least one point to have a chance of advancing after crashing 3-0 to the czechs in their opener . more than just a game the americans are already looking forward to a world cup homecoming in kaiserslautern , which is close to a major us air base .
renamed " k-town " by the 55,000 american soldiers and their families stationed there who struggle to pronounce its german name , the smallest world cup venue is probably the most americanized city in europe . us striker eddie johnson said the encounter against italy is more than just another soccer game . " it 's like the world cup , we 're here for war , " johnson told reporters .
" we 're going to do what we gotta do .
you 've got to do things when the referee 's not looking .
you 've go to do what we have to do to get three points .
i do n't want to go home early .

" there is -lrb- claudio -rrb- reyna , who plays in europe and then there is the other lad from psv eindhoven , " said pirlo , referring to midfielder damarcus beasley .

their style on the pitch may not match their style off it but the italians are always a force to be reckoned with and their world cup record speaks for itself .
impressive czechs beat defiant us 3-0 the first game in group e , considered one of the tougher ones , was a one-sided affair as the czech republic showed a great example of tactically well played soccer .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .
united states -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 18-kasey keller ; 6-steve cherundolo , 22-oguchi onyewu , 23-eddie pope , 3-carlos bocanegra ; 8-clint dempsey , 10-claudio reyna , 4-pablo mastroeni , 15-bobby convey ; 21-landon donovan , 20-brian mcbride .
coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .

coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .

the us crowd want a penalty but donovan appears to have slipped .
9. min .

11. min .
if italy are looking to hit the usa on the break they are doing everything right apart from actually getting the ball and breaking !
the whole team except toni is in the italian half waiting to break up the us attacks .

he breaks dangerously but is fouled on the elft flank by steve cherundolo .

the ball skims just wide of buffon 's goal .
20. min .

he has no other choice but to haul down gilardino and is lucky just to get a yellow .
21. min .
goal italy 22. min .
gilardino dives in at the near post to head in italy filled the box waiting for the free-kick but the ball came in early and the milan striker gilardino dived in front of everyone to arrow an unstoppable low header past kasey keller .
you 'd have to say the goal comes against the run of play .
24. min .
the usa will have to show character now .
when they went behind to the czech republic , they had no reply and were taken apart at will .
the italians will be just as ruthless given the chance .
26. min .
goal usa 27. min .
cristian zaccardo scores a bizzare own goal !

the goal , which looks good in the replays , does n't stand .
40. min .
italy look to soak up pressure and hit gilardino with long balls over the already cautioned eddie pope .
the us look to exploit the sending off of de rossi by piling forward in numbers , swamping the retreating defense .
42. min .
bocanegra shoots !
a great long distance effort from carlos bocanegra dips just over the bar and ends up in the top netting .
it would have been a peach of a goal to take the lead with just before half-time .
43. min .
claudio reyna is the next us player to go close but his shot is deflected behind for a corner .
45. min .
pablo mastroeni gets a straight red !
the us defender is the next one heading for an early bath after a late challenge which completely missed the ball but took andrea pirlo 's ankle .
it 's now ten versus ten .
45 + 3. min .

karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .

we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .

in terms of sendings-off ; italy won , having only one man dismissed to usa 's two .
in between the goals and the cards , everything else possible happened . italy were held to a 1-1 draw by the usa in a bad-tempered world cup clash here saturday in which three players were sent off . the result means that all four teams in group e , which also includes ghana and the czech republic , still have a chance of making the last 16 . alberto gilardino gave italy the lead with a diving header , but an own goal by cristian zaccardo brought the usa back on level terms . us striker eddie johnson had caused a rumpus earlier in the week by comparing the world cup to war .
it was n't warfare , but this gripping contest was far from friendly . three-time world champions italy had daniele de rossi sent off in the 28th minute for elbowing brian mcbride and the usa 's pablo mastroeni shortly followed him down the tunnel for clattering into andrea pirlo . the americans were then reduced to nine men a minute after half time when eddie pope picked up his second yellow card .

it was n't warfare , but this gripping contest was far from friendly . three-time world champions italy had daniele de rossi sent off in the 28th minute for elbowing brian mcbride and the usa 's pablo mastroeni shortly followed him down the tunnel for clattering into andrea pirlo . the americans were then reduced to nine men a minute after half time when eddie pope picked up his second yellow card .
it was only the fourth time in the history of the world cup that three players had been sent off in the same match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope 's second yellow meant usa finished with nine men kasey keller pulled off two excellent saves to deny italy substitute alessandro del piero in the closing stages as the usa bravely dug in to snatch a point . the result leaves the group wide open going into the final first round match with italy on four points , followed by the czech republic and ghana both on three and the usa on one . italy next face the czech republic in hamburg next thursday , while the usa take on ghana in nuremberg the same day . the americans , quarter-finalists four years ago , made life difficult for the italians in the first quarter of an hour , snapping into tackles and creating two half chances which bobby convey and dempsey wasted . italy absorbed the pressure and took the lead in the 22nd minute after pope 's foul on luca toni wide on the right . pirlo delivered a low centre into the box and gilardino stooped to steer the ball past a helpless keller with his forehead . italy 's joy lasted just five minutes with a defensive howler gifting the usa an equalizer . zaccardo swung a boot out wildly to try and clear convey 's crossed free-kick and succeeded only in diverting the ball past his own keeper , gianluigi buffon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian mcbride recovered to threaten for the us in attack worse was to follow seconds later as de rossi was rightly sent off for elbowing mcbride in the face .
mcbride 's face was dripping with blood as de rossi headed down the tunnel with his head hung low . despite their numerical disadvantage , italy almost restored their lead but toni shot wide after sprinting clear of the usa defense . mastroeni then joined de rossi for an early bath following a late lunge on pirlo . pope lasted just 60 seconds of the second-half before the usa 's carlos bocanegra headed against his own bar . mcbride should have hit the target after being put clear by landon donovan and gianluca zambrotta drove wide for italy as play swung from end to end . del piero 's introduction lifted italy , but the two chances that fell his way were superbly stopped by keller . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de team usa takes on mighty azzuri in group e clash the united states will face italy in a world cup group e match in kaiserslautern on saturday and will be hoping to avoid a repeat of their crushing 0-3 defeat in the opener .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .

he said that he would appeal the ruling . easy to read , and fun the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by a traffic psychologist , karl peglau , when an increase in cars in the former east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim rossberg has said he 'll appeal the ruling peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .
portuguese soccer officials insisted that ronaldo was merely tired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's luis figo , left , and angola 's andre challenge for the ball but the portuguese can still count on a star line-up with deco - counted among the world 's best midfielders and nicknamed " the magic one " for his deadly free kicks and long passes - and captain luis figo , the two most experienced members of the team . figo , who turns 34 in november , proved his worth when he orchestrated the 1-0 win over angola by breaking through the defense to set up pauleta 's goal . portugal has its sights trained high for the world cup .

he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

mcbride 's face was dripping with blood as de rossi headed down the tunnel with his head hung low . despite their numerical disadvantage , italy almost restored their lead but toni shot wide after sprinting clear of the usa defense . mastroeni then joined de rossi for an early bath following a late lunge on pirlo . pope lasted just 60 seconds of the second-half before the usa 's carlos bocanegra headed against his own bar . mcbride should have hit the target after being put clear by landon donovan and gianluca zambrotta drove wide for italy as play swung from end to end . del piero 's introduction lifted italy , but the two chances that fell his way were superbly stopped by keller . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de team usa takes on mighty azzuri in group e clash the united states will face italy in a world cup group e match in kaiserslautern on saturday and will be hoping to avoid a repeat of their crushing 0-3 defeat in the opener .

fan behavior has also come in for praise . so far , the only significant trouble came alongside wednesday 's germany-poland match in dortmund , where 430 people were detained briefly . " it shows that security forces trained just as hard for the world cup as the german national team did , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal office , was quoted as telling the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung on saturday , adding he saw no indication of a terrorist threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg ziercke , president of germany 's federal criminal office " the police are very watchful and vigorous action is being taken consistently against troublemakers - as on wednesday in dortmund , " he added .
" i am firmly convinced that the games will remain peaceful . " alluding to possible activities by germany 's far right , ziercke said that " we will not meet with tolerance actions of intolerance against the state of law . " a string of attacks on nonwhites in the weeks before the world cup , particularly in germany 's formerly communist east , raised concerns ahead of the tournament .
it unleashed a debate about the existence of " no-go areas " in the east and some groups urged nonwhites to avoid the areas for their own safety . the debate threatened to mar the image germany hopes to project during the tournament , that of an open , tolerant and basically fun-loving society . praise for england another round of praise went to england 's fans , who are often the pariahs of international soccer due their reputation for hooliganism . this time , according to wolfgang niersbach , vice-president of the german organizing committee , the behaviour of england 's supporters has been one of the hightlights of the four-week tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans " by our estimates , there were 60,000 or 70,000 english fans in nuremberg for the match against trinidad & tobago and their exemplary behaviour was being discussed by many people , " he told reporters at fifa 's daily news briefing on friday . during the thursday game in nuremberg , only 26 england fans were detained by police before and after england 's 2-0 win . kevin miles , international coordinator for the -lrb- english -rrb- football supporters federation , told reuters his group has always maintained that the majority of england fans behave well for the majority of the time . " i am delighted to hear that excellent behaviour of england fans has been recognized by the authorities , " he said . niersbach also applauded the conduct of swedish fans in berlin for thursday 's match against paraguay , and the fact that many germans put on sweden 's yellow shirts in support of the scandinavians . " the atmosphere at the stadiums was incredible , " he said .
" the fans are behaving so well , long may it continue .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .

the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .

he is alone but pokes a tame shot straight at keller .
87. min .
a great team move involving del piero , pirlo and iaquinta carves open the us defense but when the ball is whipped into the crowded box there is n't an adequate italian boot to apply the finishing touch .
89. min .
gilardino gets on the end of a deep cross but his header flies well wide , much to his frustration .
90 + 2. min .
full-time : a pulsating but bad tempered 1-1 draw the us and italy are deadlocked at the end but this has been no boring drawn match .
both sides gave everything and sacrificed men in the pursuit of the win .
group e remains an interesting prospect : italy have four points , ghana and the czech republic three and the us have one .

fan behavior has also come in for praise . so far , the only significant trouble came alongside wednesday 's germany-poland match in dortmund , where 430 people were detained briefly . " it shows that security forces trained just as hard for the world cup as the german national team did , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal office , was quoted as telling the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung on saturday , adding he saw no indication of a terrorist threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg ziercke , president of germany 's federal criminal office " the police are very watchful and vigorous action is being taken consistently against troublemakers - as on wednesday in dortmund , " he added .
" i am firmly convinced that the games will remain peaceful . " alluding to possible activities by germany 's far right , ziercke said that " we will not meet with tolerance actions of intolerance against the state of law . " a string of attacks on nonwhites in the weeks before the world cup , particularly in germany 's formerly communist east , raised concerns ahead of the tournament .
it unleashed a debate about the existence of " no-go areas " in the east and some groups urged nonwhites to avoid the areas for their own safety . the debate threatened to mar the image germany hopes to project during the tournament , that of an open , tolerant and basically fun-loving society . praise for england another round of praise went to england 's fans , who are often the pariahs of international soccer due their reputation for hooliganism . this time , according to wolfgang niersbach , vice-president of the german organizing committee , the behaviour of england 's supporters has been one of the hightlights of the four-week tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans " by our estimates , there were 60,000 or 70,000 english fans in nuremberg for the match against trinidad & tobago and their exemplary behaviour was being discussed by many people , " he told reporters at fifa 's daily news briefing on friday . during the thursday game in nuremberg , only 26 england fans were detained by police before and after england 's 2-0 win . kevin miles , international coordinator for the -lrb- english -rrb- football supporters federation , told reuters his group has always maintained that the majority of england fans behave well for the majority of the time . " i am delighted to hear that excellent behaviour of england fans has been recognized by the authorities , " he said . niersbach also applauded the conduct of swedish fans in berlin for thursday 's match against paraguay , and the fact that many germans put on sweden 's yellow shirts in support of the scandinavians . " the atmosphere at the stadiums was incredible , " he said .

mcbride 's face was dripping with blood as de rossi headed down the tunnel with his head hung low . despite their numerical disadvantage , italy almost restored their lead but toni shot wide after sprinting clear of the usa defense . mastroeni then joined de rossi for an early bath following a late lunge on pirlo . pope lasted just 60 seconds of the second-half before the usa 's carlos bocanegra headed against his own bar . mcbride should have hit the target after being put clear by landon donovan and gianluca zambrotta drove wide for italy as play swung from end to end . del piero 's introduction lifted italy , but the two chances that fell his way were superbly stopped by keller . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de team usa takes on mighty azzuri in group e clash the united states will face italy in a world cup group e match in kaiserslautern on saturday and will be hoping to avoid a repeat of their crushing 0-3 defeat in the opener .

" i think they are ready to give a good effort . " giving no hints of the lineup changes he plans for saturday 's match , arena said he expects players to answer their wake-up call and play better then than they did in a 3-0 loss monday to the czech republic in a group e opener . us fears italian strikers " all we did is loose a game .
the challenge in any sport is how you respond , " arena said .
" naturally there is over-reaction in the short term .
if there is any kind of quality in the team , you bounce back . " but the us will need more than morale-boosting to perform against the azzuri , who thrashed ghana 2-0 in their first world cup game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's alberto gilardino poses a major threat to the us fiorentina striker luca toni and ac milan forward alberto gilardino are italy 's top threats , supported by some of best set-up men in the sport . " the guys we 're most concerned about are their two strikers , who are probably among the best tandem of strikers in the world cup , " arena said .
" both are tremendous finishers .
gilardino is a lethal finisher inside the box and he is in position all the time , " arena said .
" they have an excellent midfield .
if they sit back , you need to be patient , pick your chances , not get caught on the break .
they are going to be selective on how they attack you . " the us need at least one point to have a chance of advancing after crashing 3-0 to the czechs in their opener . more than just a game the americans are already looking forward to a world cup homecoming in kaiserslautern , which is close to a major us air base .
renamed " k-town " by the 55,000 american soldiers and their families stationed there who struggle to pronounce its german name , the smallest world cup venue is probably the most americanized city in europe . us striker eddie johnson said the encounter against italy is more than just another soccer game . " it 's like the world cup , we 're here for war , " johnson told reporters .
" we 're going to do what we gotta do .
you 've got to do things when the referee 's not looking .
you 've go to do what we have to do to get three points .
i do n't want to go home early . " us who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reyna 's the only face the italians can identify from the us squad the italians ' preparations for the game will have to start from scratch , with most players confessing complete ignorance about who they will be up again .
of three italian players asked what they knew about the american team , only midfielder andrea pirlo was able to name a single member of the squad . " there is -lrb- claudio -rrb- reyna , who plays in europe and then there is the other lad from psv eindhoven , " said pirlo , referring to midfielder damarcus beasley . " i do n't know much about the players who do n't play in europe , but we will watch some videos , " added pirlo , who scored the opening goal against ghana . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : usa once the usa were not even considered capable of playing " the other football " .

world cup team checks : italy italian soccer has suffered many insults over the years .
their style on the pitch may not match their style off it but the italians are always a force to be reckoned with and their world cup record speaks for itself .
impressive czechs beat defiant us 3-0 the first game in group e , considered one of the tougher ones , was a one-sided affair as the czech republic showed a great example of tactically well played soccer .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .

coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .
1. min .

7. min .
landon donovan goes down in the box as he tries to get on the end of a long cross .
the us crowd want a penalty but donovan appears to have slipped .
9. min .
the usa are growing in confidence as they increase their possession , passing their way intelligently to the edge of the italy box as they look for an opening .
11. min .
if italy are looking to hit the usa on the break they are doing everything right apart from actually getting the ball and breaking !
the whole team except toni is in the italian half waiting to break up the us attacks .
13. min .
the newly returned zambrotta shows the us what danger can come of committed too many men into attack .
he breaks dangerously but is fouled on the elft flank by steve cherundolo .

goal italy 22. min .
gilardino dives in at the near post to head in italy filled the box waiting for the free-kick but the ball came in early and the milan striker gilardino dived in front of everyone to arrow an unstoppable low header past kasey keller .
you 'd have to say the goal comes against the run of play .
24. min .
the usa will have to show character now .
when they went behind to the czech republic , they had no reply and were taken apart at will .
the italians will be just as ruthless given the chance .
26. min .
goal usa 27. min .

36. min .
disallowed goal for italy gattuso makes an immediate impression by putting the ball in the net with an exquisite chip but luca toni , not interfering with play and returning from an offside position , is deemed to be offside .
the goal , which looks good in the replays , does n't stand .
40. min .
italy look to soak up pressure and hit gilardino with long balls over the already cautioned eddie pope .
the us look to exploit the sending off of de rossi by piling forward in numbers , swamping the retreating defense .
42. min .
bocanegra shoots !
a great long distance effort from carlos bocanegra dips just over the bar and ends up in the top netting .
it would have been a peach of a goal to take the lead with just before half-time .
43. min .
claudio reyna is the next us player to go close but his shot is deflected behind for a corner .
45. min .
pablo mastroeni gets a straight red !
the us defender is the next one heading for an early bath after a late challenge which completely missed the ball but took andrea pirlo 's ankle .
it 's now ten versus ten .
45 + 3. min .
half-time : a goal apiece ; a red card apiece the us and italy come off the pitch after an incident packed first-half .
45. min .
second-half : the match restarts italy kick-off the second-half .
46. min .
eddie pope gets his second yellow !

can del piero win the day for ten-man italy over nine-man usa ? 57. min .
claudio reyna advances with menace towards the italy goal with dfeneders backing off .
the us captain has time to get closer but chooses to stab a weak shot at goal from distance which barely makes it to the touchline .
60. min .
dempsey claims zambrotta handles in the area but the claims for a penalty are half-hearted and the ref waves play on .

62. min .

64. min .
disallowed goal for united states the referee calls the usa 's second goal offside and kaiserslautern erupts into whistles !
the replays show that mcbride is offside when he back heels the ball past buffon .
67. min .
zambrotta goes close with a wicked curling shot from the edge of the area .
the midfielder drifts past onyewu and curls a fast shot past kasey keller but just past the post as well .
70. min .
zambrotta is the next in the ref 's book the italian forgets that you change shirts at the end of the game as he tustles with landon donovan .
he ends the tugging of the us star 's shirt with a fine shove in the back which earns him a booking .
73. min .

kasey keller again makes a flying save , this time from andrea pirlo .
the us keeper is earning his corn tonight .
83. min .
the us have people queuing up to take a shot at buffon 's goal but they seem content with the draw .
what other reason could there be for the lack of incisive passes and running when the goal is at their mercy ? 84. min .
pirlo threads the most precise of passes through the us defense to iaquinta who does n't realize he has so much time .
he is alone but pokes a tame shot straight at keller .
87. min .
a great team move involving del piero , pirlo and iaquinta carves open the us defense but when the ball is whipped into the crowded box there is n't an adequate italian boot to apply the finishing touch .
89. min .
gilardino gets on the end of a deep cross but his header flies well wide , much to his frustration .
90 + 2. min .
full-time : a pulsating but bad tempered 1-1 draw the us and italy are deadlocked at the end but this has been no boring drawn match .

it is the first time portugal has made it past the first round since 1966 , when eusebio inspired them to third place in england . after some bad-tempered exchanges , portugal 's class told in the 63rd minute . cutting in from the left , captain luis figo laid off to deco whose first-time shot sailed into the right corner , giving iran 's goalkeeper no chance . iran were not done and vahid hashemian 's powerful header forced a smart stop from ricardo . but it was all over when captain yahya golmohammadi sent his opposite number figo tumbling in the box , allowing ronaldo to step up and bury his penalty in the top right-hand corner . physical iran counter portugal 's flair with tough tackles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tricky ronaldo was on the end of some brutal treatment portugal were mostly on the attack throughout the game , enjoying the best of the action in an ill-tempered first period when some heavy challenges brought protests from coach luiz felipe scolari . portugal went close near half-time when miguel 's run and shot from an acute angle squirmed under goalkeeper ebrahim mirzapour and bounced across the face of goal . early on , figo picked out deco in the box but his fierce shot was palmed away .
figo also floated a free-kick to maniche but his volley from distance was headed over by the iranian defense . the trick-filled ronaldo enjoyed a busy first half , juggling the ball on the edge of the area at one point . he skimmed the outside of the post and blazed one over but cut a frustrated figure at half-time after a series of decisions went iran 's way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercurial luis figo ran the game from midfield iran 's action was mainly restricted to set-pieces , although javad nekounam hit the post before being ruled offside . ronaldo continued to shine after the break , forcing a sharp save from mirzapour at his near post . pauleta tried to meet a nuno valente cross with the outside of his right boot but the flick flew over . at the other end , iran came close when a long ball found rasoul khatibi in the area but his shot went across the face of the goal . iran battled on until penalty broke resolve but portugal 's second goal broke iranian resolve and , with centre-half golmohammadi subbed off injured , they finished the match on the defensive . pauleta had a chance to increase his record goals tally in the final minutes but shot tamely , and ronaldo had a goal ruled out for offside on the whistle . portugal beat angola 1-0 in their opening game while iran went down 3-1 to mexico . portugal need only draw with mexico on wednesday to win the group . iran have now only won one world cup match in three visits , a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 , but they have a chance to rectify that when they meet angola on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on track portugal meet embattled iran struggling to stay on in the tournament and missing captain and top-scorer ali daei , beleaguered iran face portugal in the group d match in frankfurt on saturday .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .
united states -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 18-kasey keller ; 6-steve cherundolo , 22-oguchi onyewu , 23-eddie pope , 3-carlos bocanegra ; 8-clint dempsey , 10-claudio reyna , 4-pablo mastroeni , 15-bobby convey ; 21-landon donovan , 20-brian mcbride .
coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .
portuguese soccer officials insisted that ronaldo was merely tired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's luis figo , left , and angola 's andre challenge for the ball but the portuguese can still count on a star line-up with deco - counted among the world 's best midfielders and nicknamed " the magic one " for his deadly free kicks and long passes - and captain luis figo , the two most experienced members of the team . figo , who turns 34 in november , proved his worth when he orchestrated the 1-0 win over angola by breaking through the defense to set up pauleta 's goal . portugal has its sights trained high for the world cup .

he said that he would appeal the ruling . easy to read , and fun the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by a traffic psychologist , karl peglau , when an increase in cars in the former east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim rossberg has said he 'll appeal the ruling peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 17.06.2006 deco and ronaldo break iran 's resolve as portugal win 2-0 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristiano ronaldo -lrb- 17 -rrb- celebrates his penalty following deco 's long distance screamer portugal qualified for the world cup knock-out stages for the first time in 40 years on saturday with a 2-0 win over iran .
goals from cristiano ronaldo and deco sealed the victory . iran offered robust resistance for more than an hour before brazilian-born deco 's unstoppable opener .
cristiano ronaldo settled the matter with a penalty 10 minutes from the end . the win guarantees portugal 's progress from group d , while mexico and angola are both in contention for the other qualification spot .
it is the first time portugal has made it past the first round since 1966 , when eusebio inspired them to third place in england . after some bad-tempered exchanges , portugal 's class told in the 63rd minute . cutting in from the left , captain luis figo laid off to deco whose first-time shot sailed into the right corner , giving iran 's goalkeeper no chance . iran were not done and vahid hashemian 's powerful header forced a smart stop from ricardo . but it was all over when captain yahya golmohammadi sent his opposite number figo tumbling in the box , allowing ronaldo to step up and bury his penalty in the top right-hand corner . physical iran counter portugal 's flair with tough tackles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tricky ronaldo was on the end of some brutal treatment portugal were mostly on the attack throughout the game , enjoying the best of the action in an ill-tempered first period when some heavy challenges brought protests from coach luiz felipe scolari . portugal went close near half-time when miguel 's run and shot from an acute angle squirmed under goalkeeper ebrahim mirzapour and bounced across the face of goal . early on , figo picked out deco in the box but his fierce shot was palmed away .
figo also floated a free-kick to maniche but his volley from distance was headed over by the iranian defense . the trick-filled ronaldo enjoyed a busy first half , juggling the ball on the edge of the area at one point . he skimmed the outside of the post and blazed one over but cut a frustrated figure at half-time after a series of decisions went iran 's way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercurial luis figo ran the game from midfield iran 's action was mainly restricted to set-pieces , although javad nekounam hit the post before being ruled offside . ronaldo continued to shine after the break , forcing a sharp save from mirzapour at his near post . pauleta tried to meet a nuno valente cross with the outside of his right boot but the flick flew over . at the other end , iran came close when a long ball found rasoul khatibi in the area but his shot went across the face of the goal . iran battled on until penalty broke resolve but portugal 's second goal broke iranian resolve and , with centre-half golmohammadi subbed off injured , they finished the match on the defensive . pauleta had a chance to increase his record goals tally in the final minutes but shot tamely , and ronaldo had a goal ruled out for offside on the whistle . portugal beat angola 1-0 in their opening game while iran went down 3-1 to mexico . portugal need only draw with mexico on wednesday to win the group . iran have now only won one world cup match in three visits , a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 , but they have a chance to rectify that when they meet angola on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on track portugal meet embattled iran struggling to stay on in the tournament and missing captain and top-scorer ali daei , beleaguered iran face portugal in the group d match in frankfurt on saturday .

he said that he would appeal the ruling . easy to read , and fun the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by a traffic psychologist , karl peglau , when an increase in cars in the former east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim rossberg has said he 'll appeal the ruling peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .

the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .

united states -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 18-kasey keller ; 6-steve cherundolo , 22-oguchi onyewu , 23-eddie pope , 3-carlos bocanegra ; 8-clint dempsey , 10-claudio reyna , 4-pablo mastroeni , 15-bobby convey ; 21-landon donovan , 20-brian mcbride .
coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .
united states -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 18-kasey keller ; 6-steve cherundolo , 22-oguchi onyewu , 23-eddie pope , 3-carlos bocanegra ; 8-clint dempsey , 10-claudio reyna , 4-pablo mastroeni , 15-bobby convey ; 21-landon donovan , 20-brian mcbride .
coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .

goal italy 22. min .
gilardino dives in at the near post to head in italy filled the box waiting for the free-kick but the ball came in early and the milan striker gilardino dived in front of everyone to arrow an unstoppable low header past kasey keller .

24. min .
the usa will have to show character now .
when they went behind to the czech republic , they had no reply and were taken apart at will .
the italians will be just as ruthless given the chance .

the goal , which looks good in the replays , does n't stand .
40. min .
italy look to soak up pressure and hit gilardino with long balls over the already cautioned eddie pope .
the us look to exploit the sending off of de rossi by piling forward in numbers , swamping the retreating defense .
42. min .

in terms of sendings-off ; italy won , having only one man dismissed to usa 's two .

he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

goals from cristiano ronaldo and deco sealed the victory . iran offered robust resistance for more than an hour before brazilian-born deco 's unstoppable opener .
cristiano ronaldo settled the matter with a penalty 10 minutes from the end . the win guarantees portugal 's progress from group d , while mexico and angola are both in contention for the other qualification spot .
it is the first time portugal has made it past the first round since 1966 , when eusebio inspired them to third place in england . after some bad-tempered exchanges , portugal 's class told in the 63rd minute . cutting in from the left , captain luis figo laid off to deco whose first-time shot sailed into the right corner , giving iran 's goalkeeper no chance . iran were not done and vahid hashemian 's powerful header forced a smart stop from ricardo . but it was all over when captain yahya golmohammadi sent his opposite number figo tumbling in the box , allowing ronaldo to step up and bury his penalty in the top right-hand corner . physical iran counter portugal 's flair with tough tackles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tricky ronaldo was on the end of some brutal treatment portugal were mostly on the attack throughout the game , enjoying the best of the action in an ill-tempered first period when some heavy challenges brought protests from coach luiz felipe scolari . portugal went close near half-time when miguel 's run and shot from an acute angle squirmed under goalkeeper ebrahim mirzapour and bounced across the face of goal . early on , figo picked out deco in the box but his fierce shot was palmed away .

" i think they are ready to give a good effort . " giving no hints of the lineup changes he plans for saturday 's match , arena said he expects players to answer their wake-up call and play better then than they did in a 3-0 loss monday to the czech republic in a group e opener . us fears italian strikers " all we did is loose a game .
the challenge in any sport is how you respond , " arena said .
" naturally there is over-reaction in the short term .
if there is any kind of quality in the team , you bounce back . " but the us will need more than morale-boosting to perform against the azzuri , who thrashed ghana 2-0 in their first world cup game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's alberto gilardino poses a major threat to the us fiorentina striker luca toni and ac milan forward alberto gilardino are italy 's top threats , supported by some of best set-up men in the sport . " the guys we 're most concerned about are their two strikers , who are probably among the best tandem of strikers in the world cup , " arena said .
" both are tremendous finishers .
gilardino is a lethal finisher inside the box and he is in position all the time , " arena said .
" they have an excellent midfield .
if they sit back , you need to be patient , pick your chances , not get caught on the break .
they are going to be selective on how they attack you . " the us need at least one point to have a chance of advancing after crashing 3-0 to the czechs in their opener . more than just a game the americans are already looking forward to a world cup homecoming in kaiserslautern , which is close to a major us air base .
renamed " k-town " by the 55,000 american soldiers and their families stationed there who struggle to pronounce its german name , the smallest world cup venue is probably the most americanized city in europe . us striker eddie johnson said the encounter against italy is more than just another soccer game . " it 's like the world cup , we 're here for war , " johnson told reporters .
" we 're going to do what we gotta do .
you 've got to do things when the referee 's not looking .
you 've go to do what we have to do to get three points .
i do n't want to go home early . " us who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reyna 's the only face the italians can identify from the us squad the italians ' preparations for the game will have to start from scratch , with most players confessing complete ignorance about who they will be up again .
of three italian players asked what they knew about the american team , only midfielder andrea pirlo was able to name a single member of the squad . " there is -lrb- claudio -rrb- reyna , who plays in europe and then there is the other lad from psv eindhoven , " said pirlo , referring to midfielder damarcus beasley . " i do n't know much about the players who do n't play in europe , but we will watch some videos , " added pirlo , who scored the opening goal against ghana . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : usa once the usa were not even considered capable of playing " the other football " .
but after a quarter-final push in the 2002 world cup , their stock rose and the americans are currently ranked fifth in the world .
world cup team checks : italy italian soccer has suffered many insults over the years .
their style on the pitch may not match their style off it but the italians are always a force to be reckoned with and their world cup record speaks for itself .
impressive czechs beat defiant us 3-0 the first game in group e , considered one of the tougher ones , was a one-sided affair as the czech republic showed a great example of tactically well played soccer .

" i think they are ready to give a good effort . " giving no hints of the lineup changes he plans for saturday 's match , arena said he expects players to answer their wake-up call and play better then than they did in a 3-0 loss monday to the czech republic in a group e opener . us fears italian strikers " all we did is loose a game .
the challenge in any sport is how you respond , " arena said .
" naturally there is over-reaction in the short term .
if there is any kind of quality in the team , you bounce back . " but the us will need more than morale-boosting to perform against the azzuri , who thrashed ghana 2-0 in their first world cup game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's alberto gilardino poses a major threat to the us fiorentina striker luca toni and ac milan forward alberto gilardino are italy 's top threats , supported by some of best set-up men in the sport . " the guys we 're most concerned about are their two strikers , who are probably among the best tandem of strikers in the world cup , " arena said .
" both are tremendous finishers .
gilardino is a lethal finisher inside the box and he is in position all the time , " arena said .
" they have an excellent midfield .
if they sit back , you need to be patient , pick your chances , not get caught on the break .
they are going to be selective on how they attack you . " the us need at least one point to have a chance of advancing after crashing 3-0 to the czechs in their opener . more than just a game the americans are already looking forward to a world cup homecoming in kaiserslautern , which is close to a major us air base .
renamed " k-town " by the 55,000 american soldiers and their families stationed there who struggle to pronounce its german name , the smallest world cup venue is probably the most americanized city in europe . us striker eddie johnson said the encounter against italy is more than just another soccer game . " it 's like the world cup , we 're here for war , " johnson told reporters .
" we 're going to do what we gotta do .
you 've got to do things when the referee 's not looking .
you 've go to do what we have to do to get three points .
i do n't want to go home early . " us who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reyna 's the only face the italians can identify from the us squad the italians ' preparations for the game will have to start from scratch , with most players confessing complete ignorance about who they will be up again .
of three italian players asked what they knew about the american team , only midfielder andrea pirlo was able to name a single member of the squad . " there is -lrb- claudio -rrb- reyna , who plays in europe and then there is the other lad from psv eindhoven , " said pirlo , referring to midfielder damarcus beasley . " i do n't know much about the players who do n't play in europe , but we will watch some videos , " added pirlo , who scored the opening goal against ghana . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : usa once the usa were not even considered capable of playing " the other football " .
but after a quarter-final push in the 2002 world cup , their stock rose and the americans are currently ranked fifth in the world .
world cup team checks : italy italian soccer has suffered many insults over the years .
their style on the pitch may not match their style off it but the italians are always a force to be reckoned with and their world cup record speaks for itself .
impressive czechs beat defiant us 3-0 the first game in group e , considered one of the tougher ones , was a one-sided affair as the czech republic showed a great example of tactically well played soccer .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .

89. min .
gilardino gets on the end of a deep cross but his header flies well wide , much to his frustration .
90 + 2. min .
full-time : a pulsating but bad tempered 1-1 draw the us and italy are deadlocked at the end but this has been no boring drawn match .
both sides gave everything and sacrificed men in the pursuit of the win .
group e remains an interesting prospect : italy have four points , ghana and the czech republic three and the us have one .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .
portuguese soccer officials insisted that ronaldo was merely tired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's luis figo , left , and angola 's andre challenge for the ball but the portuguese can still count on a star line-up with deco - counted among the world 's best midfielders and nicknamed " the magic one " for his deadly free kicks and long passes - and captain luis figo , the two most experienced members of the team . figo , who turns 34 in november , proved his worth when he orchestrated the 1-0 win over angola by breaking through the defense to set up pauleta 's goal . portugal has its sights trained high for the world cup .

" i think they are ready to give a good effort . " giving no hints of the lineup changes he plans for saturday 's match , arena said he expects players to answer their wake-up call and play better then than they did in a 3-0 loss monday to the czech republic in a group e opener . us fears italian strikers " all we did is loose a game .
the challenge in any sport is how you respond , " arena said .
" naturally there is over-reaction in the short term .
if there is any kind of quality in the team , you bounce back . " but the us will need more than morale-boosting to perform against the azzuri , who thrashed ghana 2-0 in their first world cup game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's alberto gilardino poses a major threat to the us fiorentina striker luca toni and ac milan forward alberto gilardino are italy 's top threats , supported by some of best set-up men in the sport . " the guys we 're most concerned about are their two strikers , who are probably among the best tandem of strikers in the world cup , " arena said .
" both are tremendous finishers .
gilardino is a lethal finisher inside the box and he is in position all the time , " arena said .
" they have an excellent midfield .
if they sit back , you need to be patient , pick your chances , not get caught on the break .
they are going to be selective on how they attack you . " the us need at least one point to have a chance of advancing after crashing 3-0 to the czechs in their opener . more than just a game the americans are already looking forward to a world cup homecoming in kaiserslautern , which is close to a major us air base .
renamed " k-town " by the 55,000 american soldiers and their families stationed there who struggle to pronounce its german name , the smallest world cup venue is probably the most americanized city in europe . us striker eddie johnson said the encounter against italy is more than just another soccer game . " it 's like the world cup , we 're here for war , " johnson told reporters .
" we 're going to do what we gotta do .
you 've got to do things when the referee 's not looking .
you 've go to do what we have to do to get three points .
i do n't want to go home early . " us who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reyna 's the only face the italians can identify from the us squad the italians ' preparations for the game will have to start from scratch , with most players confessing complete ignorance about who they will be up again .
of three italian players asked what they knew about the american team , only midfielder andrea pirlo was able to name a single member of the squad . " there is -lrb- claudio -rrb- reyna , who plays in europe and then there is the other lad from psv eindhoven , " said pirlo , referring to midfielder damarcus beasley . " i do n't know much about the players who do n't play in europe , but we will watch some videos , " added pirlo , who scored the opening goal against ghana . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : usa once the usa were not even considered capable of playing " the other football " .
but after a quarter-final push in the 2002 world cup , their stock rose and the americans are currently ranked fifth in the world .
world cup team checks : italy italian soccer has suffered many insults over the years .
their style on the pitch may not match their style off it but the italians are always a force to be reckoned with and their world cup record speaks for itself .
impressive czechs beat defiant us 3-0 the first game in group e , considered one of the tougher ones , was a one-sided affair as the czech republic showed a great example of tactically well played soccer .

in terms of sendings-off ; italy won , having only one man dismissed to usa 's two .
in between the goals and the cards , everything else possible happened . italy were held to a 1-1 draw by the usa in a bad-tempered world cup clash here saturday in which three players were sent off . the result means that all four teams in group e , which also includes ghana and the czech republic , still have a chance of making the last 16 . alberto gilardino gave italy the lead with a diving header , but an own goal by cristian zaccardo brought the usa back on level terms . us striker eddie johnson had caused a rumpus earlier in the week by comparing the world cup to war .
it was n't warfare , but this gripping contest was far from friendly . three-time world champions italy had daniele de rossi sent off in the 28th minute for elbowing brian mcbride and the usa 's pablo mastroeni shortly followed him down the tunnel for clattering into andrea pirlo . the americans were then reduced to nine men a minute after half time when eddie pope picked up his second yellow card .
it was only the fourth time in the history of the world cup that three players had been sent off in the same match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope 's second yellow meant usa finished with nine men kasey keller pulled off two excellent saves to deny italy substitute alessandro del piero in the closing stages as the usa bravely dug in to snatch a point . the result leaves the group wide open going into the final first round match with italy on four points , followed by the czech republic and ghana both on three and the usa on one . italy next face the czech republic in hamburg next thursday , while the usa take on ghana in nuremberg the same day . the americans , quarter-finalists four years ago , made life difficult for the italians in the first quarter of an hour , snapping into tackles and creating two half chances which bobby convey and dempsey wasted . italy absorbed the pressure and took the lead in the 22nd minute after pope 's foul on luca toni wide on the right . pirlo delivered a low centre into the box and gilardino stooped to steer the ball past a helpless keller with his forehead . italy 's joy lasted just five minutes with a defensive howler gifting the usa an equalizer . zaccardo swung a boot out wildly to try and clear convey 's crossed free-kick and succeeded only in diverting the ball past his own keeper , gianluigi buffon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian mcbride recovered to threaten for the us in attack worse was to follow seconds later as de rossi was rightly sent off for elbowing mcbride in the face .
mcbride 's face was dripping with blood as de rossi headed down the tunnel with his head hung low . despite their numerical disadvantage , italy almost restored their lead but toni shot wide after sprinting clear of the usa defense . mastroeni then joined de rossi for an early bath following a late lunge on pirlo . pope lasted just 60 seconds of the second-half before the usa 's carlos bocanegra headed against his own bar . mcbride should have hit the target after being put clear by landon donovan and gianluca zambrotta drove wide for italy as play swung from end to end . del piero 's introduction lifted italy , but the two chances that fell his way were superbly stopped by keller . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de team usa takes on mighty azzuri in group e clash the united states will face italy in a world cup group e match in kaiserslautern on saturday and will be hoping to avoid a repeat of their crushing 0-3 defeat in the opener .

" i think they are ready to give a good effort . " giving no hints of the lineup changes he plans for saturday 's match , arena said he expects players to answer their wake-up call and play better then than they did in a 3-0 loss monday to the czech republic in a group e opener . us fears italian strikers " all we did is loose a game .
the challenge in any sport is how you respond , " arena said .
" naturally there is over-reaction in the short term .
if there is any kind of quality in the team , you bounce back . " but the us will need more than morale-boosting to perform against the azzuri , who thrashed ghana 2-0 in their first world cup game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's alberto gilardino poses a major threat to the us fiorentina striker luca toni and ac milan forward alberto gilardino are italy 's top threats , supported by some of best set-up men in the sport . " the guys we 're most concerned about are their two strikers , who are probably among the best tandem of strikers in the world cup , " arena said .
" both are tremendous finishers .
gilardino is a lethal finisher inside the box and he is in position all the time , " arena said .
" they have an excellent midfield .
if they sit back , you need to be patient , pick your chances , not get caught on the break .
they are going to be selective on how they attack you . " the us need at least one point to have a chance of advancing after crashing 3-0 to the czechs in their opener . more than just a game the americans are already looking forward to a world cup homecoming in kaiserslautern , which is close to a major us air base .
renamed " k-town " by the 55,000 american soldiers and their families stationed there who struggle to pronounce its german name , the smallest world cup venue is probably the most americanized city in europe . us striker eddie johnson said the encounter against italy is more than just another soccer game .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .
portuguese soccer officials insisted that ronaldo was merely tired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's luis figo , left , and angola 's andre challenge for the ball but the portuguese can still count on a star line-up with deco - counted among the world 's best midfielders and nicknamed " the magic one " for his deadly free kicks and long passes - and captain luis figo , the two most experienced members of the team . figo , who turns 34 in november , proved his worth when he orchestrated the 1-0 win over angola by breaking through the defense to set up pauleta 's goal . portugal has its sights trained high for the world cup .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .
united states -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 18-kasey keller ; 6-steve cherundolo , 22-oguchi onyewu , 23-eddie pope , 3-carlos bocanegra ; 8-clint dempsey , 10-claudio reyna , 4-pablo mastroeni , 15-bobby convey ; 21-landon donovan , 20-brian mcbride .
coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .
1. min .
kick-off : usa gets the game started the usa gets this crucial group e game underway .
1. min .
bocanegra makes the first clearance but it 's a nervous one which gives italy a throw .
the long throw comes in and luca toni gets a glance on the ball but it goes wide .
3. min .
fabio cannavaro prowls ahead of his back four as italy look to build patiently .
the azzurri will look to break the usa down with their passing game .
4. min .
francesco totti gets the first card 4. min .
the italy striker slides in on clint dempsey and gets the yellow card for the late challenge with barely five minutes on the clock .
6. min .
the usa are giving as hard as they get and the game 's physical nature has come to the fore early as players litter the pitch after a number of fierce challenges .
7. min .
landon donovan goes down in the box as he tries to get on the end of a long cross .
the us crowd want a penalty but donovan appears to have slipped .
9. min .
the usa are growing in confidence as they increase their possession , passing their way intelligently to the edge of the italy box as they look for an opening .

it was n't warfare , but this gripping contest was far from friendly . three-time world champions italy had daniele de rossi sent off in the 28th minute for elbowing brian mcbride and the usa 's pablo mastroeni shortly followed him down the tunnel for clattering into andrea pirlo . the americans were then reduced to nine men a minute after half time when eddie pope picked up his second yellow card .

mcbride 's face was dripping with blood as de rossi headed down the tunnel with his head hung low . despite their numerical disadvantage , italy almost restored their lead but toni shot wide after sprinting clear of the usa defense . mastroeni then joined de rossi for an early bath following a late lunge on pirlo . pope lasted just 60 seconds of the second-half before the usa 's carlos bocanegra headed against his own bar . mcbride should have hit the target after being put clear by landon donovan and gianluca zambrotta drove wide for italy as play swung from end to end . del piero 's introduction lifted italy , but the two chances that fell his way were superbly stopped by keller . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de team usa takes on mighty azzuri in group e clash the united states will face italy in a world cup group e match in kaiserslautern on saturday and will be hoping to avoid a repeat of their crushing 0-3 defeat in the opener .

he said that he would appeal the ruling . easy to read , and fun the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by a traffic psychologist , karl peglau , when an increase in cars in the former east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim rossberg has said he 'll appeal the ruling peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .
portuguese soccer officials insisted that ronaldo was merely tired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's luis figo , left , and angola 's andre challenge for the ball but the portuguese can still count on a star line-up with deco - counted among the world 's best midfielders and nicknamed " the magic one " for his deadly free kicks and long passes - and captain luis figo , the two most experienced members of the team . figo , who turns 34 in november , proved his worth when he orchestrated the 1-0 win over angola by breaking through the defense to set up pauleta 's goal . portugal has its sights trained high for the world cup .

they play the united states in their final match in a wide-open group . the czech republic , who drubbed the usa 3-0 last week , will have to play italy for the points they need to advance to the round of 16 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : czech republic 0:2 ghana review all the action with the dw-world.de live ticker .

goals from cristiano ronaldo and deco sealed the victory . iran offered robust resistance for more than an hour before brazilian-born deco 's unstoppable opener .
cristiano ronaldo settled the matter with a penalty 10 minutes from the end . the win guarantees portugal 's progress from group d , while mexico and angola are both in contention for the other qualification spot .
it is the first time portugal has made it past the first round since 1966 , when eusebio inspired them to third place in england . after some bad-tempered exchanges , portugal 's class told in the 63rd minute . cutting in from the left , captain luis figo laid off to deco whose first-time shot sailed into the right corner , giving iran 's goalkeeper no chance . iran were not done and vahid hashemian 's powerful header forced a smart stop from ricardo . but it was all over when captain yahya golmohammadi sent his opposite number figo tumbling in the box , allowing ronaldo to step up and bury his penalty in the top right-hand corner . physical iran counter portugal 's flair with tough tackles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tricky ronaldo was on the end of some brutal treatment portugal were mostly on the attack throughout the game , enjoying the best of the action in an ill-tempered first period when some heavy challenges brought protests from coach luiz felipe scolari . portugal went close near half-time when miguel 's run and shot from an acute angle squirmed under goalkeeper ebrahim mirzapour and bounced across the face of goal . early on , figo picked out deco in the box but his fierce shot was palmed away .
figo also floated a free-kick to maniche but his volley from distance was headed over by the iranian defense . the trick-filled ronaldo enjoyed a busy first half , juggling the ball on the edge of the area at one point . he skimmed the outside of the post and blazed one over but cut a frustrated figure at half-time after a series of decisions went iran 's way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercurial luis figo ran the game from midfield iran 's action was mainly restricted to set-pieces , although javad nekounam hit the post before being ruled offside . ronaldo continued to shine after the break , forcing a sharp save from mirzapour at his near post . pauleta tried to meet a nuno valente cross with the outside of his right boot but the flick flew over . at the other end , iran came close when a long ball found rasoul khatibi in the area but his shot went across the face of the goal . iran battled on until penalty broke resolve but portugal 's second goal broke iranian resolve and , with centre-half golmohammadi subbed off injured , they finished the match on the defensive . pauleta had a chance to increase his record goals tally in the final minutes but shot tamely , and ronaldo had a goal ruled out for offside on the whistle . portugal beat angola 1-0 in their opening game while iran went down 3-1 to mexico . portugal need only draw with mexico on wednesday to win the group . iran have now only won one world cup match in three visits , a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 , but they have a chance to rectify that when they meet angola on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on track portugal meet embattled iran struggling to stay on in the tournament and missing captain and top-scorer ali daei , beleaguered iran face portugal in the group d match in frankfurt on saturday .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .
portuguese soccer officials insisted that ronaldo was merely tired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's luis figo , left , and angola 's andre challenge for the ball but the portuguese can still count on a star line-up with deco - counted among the world 's best midfielders and nicknamed " the magic one " for his deadly free kicks and long passes - and captain luis figo , the two most experienced members of the team . figo , who turns 34 in november , proved his worth when he orchestrated the 1-0 win over angola by breaking through the defense to set up pauleta 's goal . portugal has its sights trained high for the world cup .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .
united states -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 18-kasey keller ; 6-steve cherundolo , 22-oguchi onyewu , 23-eddie pope , 3-carlos bocanegra ; 8-clint dempsey , 10-claudio reyna , 4-pablo mastroeni , 15-bobby convey ; 21-landon donovan , 20-brian mcbride .
coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .

70. min .
zambrotta is the next in the ref 's book the italian forgets that you change shirts at the end of the game as he tustles with landon donovan .
he ends the tugging of the us star 's shirt with a fine shove in the back which earns him a booking .

kasey keller again makes a flying save , this time from andrea pirlo .
the us keeper is earning his corn tonight .
83. min .
the us have people queuing up to take a shot at buffon 's goal but they seem content with the draw .
what other reason could there be for the lack of incisive passes and running when the goal is at their mercy ? 84. min .
pirlo threads the most precise of passes through the us defense to iaquinta who does n't realize he has so much time .
he is alone but pokes a tame shot straight at keller .
87. min .
a great team move involving del piero , pirlo and iaquinta carves open the us defense but when the ball is whipped into the crowded box there is n't an adequate italian boot to apply the finishing touch .
89. min .
gilardino gets on the end of a deep cross but his header flies well wide , much to his frustration .
90 + 2. min .
full-time : a pulsating but bad tempered 1-1 draw the us and italy are deadlocked at the end but this has been no boring drawn match .
both sides gave everything and sacrificed men in the pursuit of the win .
group e remains an interesting prospect : italy have four points , ghana and the czech republic three and the us have one .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .
united states -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 18-kasey keller ; 6-steve cherundolo , 22-oguchi onyewu , 23-eddie pope , 3-carlos bocanegra ; 8-clint dempsey , 10-claudio reyna , 4-pablo mastroeni , 15-bobby convey ; 21-landon donovan , 20-brian mcbride .
coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .

he is alone but pokes a tame shot straight at keller .
87. min .
a great team move involving del piero , pirlo and iaquinta carves open the us defense but when the ball is whipped into the crowded box there is n't an adequate italian boot to apply the finishing touch .
89. min .
gilardino gets on the end of a deep cross but his header flies well wide , much to his frustration .
90 + 2. min .
full-time : a pulsating but bad tempered 1-1 draw the us and italy are deadlocked at the end but this has been no boring drawn match .
both sides gave everything and sacrificed men in the pursuit of the win .
group e remains an interesting prospect : italy have four points , ghana and the czech republic three and the us have one .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .

coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .

70. min .
zambrotta is the next in the ref 's book the italian forgets that you change shirts at the end of the game as he tustles with landon donovan .

he is alone but pokes a tame shot straight at keller .

full-time : a pulsating but bad tempered 1-1 draw the us and italy are deadlocked at the end but this has been no boring drawn match .
both sides gave everything and sacrificed men in the pursuit of the win .

goals from cristiano ronaldo and deco sealed the victory . iran offered robust resistance for more than an hour before brazilian-born deco 's unstoppable opener .

" i think they are ready to give a good effort . " giving no hints of the lineup changes he plans for saturday 's match , arena said he expects players to answer their wake-up call and play better then than they did in a 3-0 loss monday to the czech republic in a group e opener . us fears italian strikers " all we did is loose a game .
the challenge in any sport is how you respond , " arena said .
" naturally there is over-reaction in the short term .
if there is any kind of quality in the team , you bounce back . " but the us will need more than morale-boosting to perform against the azzuri , who thrashed ghana 2-0 in their first world cup game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's alberto gilardino poses a major threat to the us fiorentina striker luca toni and ac milan forward alberto gilardino are italy 's top threats , supported by some of best set-up men in the sport . " the guys we 're most concerned about are their two strikers , who are probably among the best tandem of strikers in the world cup , " arena said .
" both are tremendous finishers .
gilardino is a lethal finisher inside the box and he is in position all the time , " arena said .
" they have an excellent midfield .
if they sit back , you need to be patient , pick your chances , not get caught on the break .
they are going to be selective on how they attack you . " the us need at least one point to have a chance of advancing after crashing 3-0 to the czechs in their opener . more than just a game the americans are already looking forward to a world cup homecoming in kaiserslautern , which is close to a major us air base .
renamed " k-town " by the 55,000 american soldiers and their families stationed there who struggle to pronounce its german name , the smallest world cup venue is probably the most americanized city in europe . us striker eddie johnson said the encounter against italy is more than just another soccer game . " it 's like the world cup , we 're here for war , " johnson told reporters .
" we 're going to do what we gotta do .
you 've got to do things when the referee 's not looking .
you 've go to do what we have to do to get three points .
i do n't want to go home early . " us who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reyna 's the only face the italians can identify from the us squad the italians ' preparations for the game will have to start from scratch , with most players confessing complete ignorance about who they will be up again .
of three italian players asked what they knew about the american team , only midfielder andrea pirlo was able to name a single member of the squad . " there is -lrb- claudio -rrb- reyna , who plays in europe and then there is the other lad from psv eindhoven , " said pirlo , referring to midfielder damarcus beasley . " i do n't know much about the players who do n't play in europe , but we will watch some videos , " added pirlo , who scored the opening goal against ghana . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : usa once the usa were not even considered capable of playing " the other football " .

world cup team checks : italy italian soccer has suffered many insults over the years .
their style on the pitch may not match their style off it but the italians are always a force to be reckoned with and their world cup record speaks for itself .
impressive czechs beat defiant us 3-0 the first game in group e , considered one of the tougher ones , was a one-sided affair as the czech republic showed a great example of tactically well played soccer .

fan behavior has also come in for praise . so far , the only significant trouble came alongside wednesday 's germany-poland match in dortmund , where 430 people were detained briefly . " it shows that security forces trained just as hard for the world cup as the german national team did , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal office , was quoted as telling the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung on saturday , adding he saw no indication of a terrorist threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg ziercke , president of germany 's federal criminal office " the police are very watchful and vigorous action is being taken consistently against troublemakers - as on wednesday in dortmund , " he added .
" i am firmly convinced that the games will remain peaceful . " alluding to possible activities by germany 's far right , ziercke said that " we will not meet with tolerance actions of intolerance against the state of law . " a string of attacks on nonwhites in the weeks before the world cup , particularly in germany 's formerly communist east , raised concerns ahead of the tournament .
it unleashed a debate about the existence of " no-go areas " in the east and some groups urged nonwhites to avoid the areas for their own safety . the debate threatened to mar the image germany hopes to project during the tournament , that of an open , tolerant and basically fun-loving society . praise for england another round of praise went to england 's fans , who are often the pariahs of international soccer due their reputation for hooliganism . this time , according to wolfgang niersbach , vice-president of the german organizing committee , the behaviour of england 's supporters has been one of the hightlights of the four-week tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans " by our estimates , there were 60,000 or 70,000 english fans in nuremberg for the match against trinidad & tobago and their exemplary behaviour was being discussed by many people , " he told reporters at fifa 's daily news briefing on friday . during the thursday game in nuremberg , only 26 england fans were detained by police before and after england 's 2-0 win . kevin miles , international coordinator for the -lrb- english -rrb- football supporters federation , told reuters his group has always maintained that the majority of england fans behave well for the majority of the time . " i am delighted to hear that excellent behaviour of england fans has been recognized by the authorities , " he said . niersbach also applauded the conduct of swedish fans in berlin for thursday 's match against paraguay , and the fact that many germans put on sweden 's yellow shirts in support of the scandinavians . " the atmosphere at the stadiums was incredible , " he said .

they play the united states in their final match in a wide-open group . the czech republic , who drubbed the usa 3-0 last week , will have to play italy for the points they need to advance to the round of 16 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : czech republic 0:2 ghana review all the action with the dw-world.de live ticker .

he said that he would appeal the ruling . easy to read , and fun the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by a traffic psychologist , karl peglau , when an increase in cars in the former east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim rossberg has said he 'll appeal the ruling peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

the group has been thrown wide open by ghana 's 2-0 win over the czech republic in cologne earlier in the day .
with the czechs , ghanians and the italians all on three points with one win each , a usa win tonight will leave the group in the balance going into the final game on thursday june 22 .
the teams : italy -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : 1-gianluigi buffon ; 2-cristian zaccardo , 13-alessandro nesta , 5-fabio cannavaro , 19-gianluca zambrotta ; 4-daniele de rossi , 21-andrea pirlo , 20-simone perrotta ; 10-francesco totti ; 9-luca toni , 11-alberto gilardino .
united states -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 18-kasey keller ; 6-steve cherundolo , 22-oguchi onyewu , 23-eddie pope , 3-carlos bocanegra ; 8-clint dempsey , 10-claudio reyna , 4-pablo mastroeni , 15-bobby convey ; 21-landon donovan , 20-brian mcbride .
coaches make changes for this crucial game italy coach marcello lippi has brought in fit-again defender gianluca zambrotta in place of fabio grosso .
zambrotta missed the 2-0 win over ghana on monday with a thigh injury .
usa coach bruce arena has made two changes from the side which lost 3-0 to the czech republic with carlos bocanegra replacing eddie lewis at left back and clint dempsey slotting in for damarcus beasley on the right side of midfield .
usa looking to harness power of " home " crowd it 's a home game of sorts for the united states as a huge number of service personnel from the nearby us air base at rammstein and their families swell the 52,000 increased capacity at the fritz-walter-stadion in kaiserslautern .
the initimate cauldron-like stadium generates a rousing atmosphere and the two teams will feel that the crowd are right on them as the game progresses .
it is unlikely that the experienced italians will be intimidated , however .
the teams come out onto the pitch italy and the usa enter the stadium on what is a balmy summer evening in kaiserslautern .
recent scorching temperatures have dropped marginally but both teams will certainly feel the heat as the game gets underway .
both teams and sets of supporters conduct themselves well during the anthems ; although what the mother of one fan will make of her son singing the italian anthem in only his lycra boxer shorts is anyone 's guess ...
no place for the fit gennarro gattuso italian coach lippi keeps the combative midfielder from ac milan on the bench for the start although what a weapon to have in your arsenal .
we can expect to see gattuso later if things get tight for the azzurri .

the us crowd want a penalty but donovan appears to have slipped .
9. min .
the usa are growing in confidence as they increase their possession , passing their way intelligently to the edge of the italy box as they look for an opening .
11. min .
if italy are looking to hit the usa on the break they are doing everything right apart from actually getting the ball and breaking !
the whole team except toni is in the italian half waiting to break up the us attacks .

46. min .
eddie pope gets his second yellow !
the second-half starts in the worst possible way as eddie pope gets his second yellow for a tackle from behind on gilardino .
48. min .
it looks as though both teams failed to cool down at half-time .
the tackles are wild , the atmosphere malevolent and the game is on the brink of boiling over completely .
50. min .
bobby convey comes off ; jimmy conrad on the us make a substitution and directly after carlos bocanegra slams a header against the italian bar ! 53. min .
zaccardo comes off for alessandro del piero the own-goal scorer comes off for the golden boy of italian soccer .
can del piero win the day for ten-man italy over nine-man usa ? 57. min .
claudio reyna advances with menace towards the italy goal with dfeneders backing off .
the us captain has time to get closer but chooses to stab a weak shot at goal from distance which barely makes it to the touchline .

67. min .
zambrotta goes close with a wicked curling shot from the edge of the area .
the midfielder drifts past onyewu and curls a fast shot past kasey keller but just past the post as well .
70. min .
zambrotta is the next in the ref 's book the italian forgets that you change shirts at the end of the game as he tustles with landon donovan .
he ends the tugging of the us star 's shirt with a fine shove in the back which earns him a booking .

kasey keller again makes a flying save , this time from andrea pirlo .
the us keeper is earning his corn tonight .
83. min .
the us have people queuing up to take a shot at buffon 's goal but they seem content with the draw .
what other reason could there be for the lack of incisive passes and running when the goal is at their mercy ? 84. min .
pirlo threads the most precise of passes through the us defense to iaquinta who does n't realize he has so much time .
he is alone but pokes a tame shot straight at keller .
87. min .
a great team move involving del piero , pirlo and iaquinta carves open the us defense but when the ball is whipped into the crowded box there is n't an adequate italian boot to apply the finishing touch .
89. min .
gilardino gets on the end of a deep cross but his header flies well wide , much to his frustration .
90 + 2. min .
full-time : a pulsating but bad tempered 1-1 draw the us and italy are deadlocked at the end but this has been no boring drawn match .
both sides gave everything and sacrificed men in the pursuit of the win .
group e remains an interesting prospect : italy have four points , ghana and the czech republic three and the us have one .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .
portuguese soccer officials insisted that ronaldo was merely tired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's luis figo , left , and angola 's andre challenge for the ball but the portuguese can still count on a star line-up with deco - counted among the world 's best midfielders and nicknamed " the magic one " for his deadly free kicks and long passes - and captain luis figo , the two most experienced members of the team . figo , who turns 34 in november , proved his worth when he orchestrated the 1-0 win over angola by breaking through the defense to set up pauleta 's goal . portugal has its sights trained high for the world cup .

in between the goals and the cards , everything else possible happened . italy were held to a 1-1 draw by the usa in a bad-tempered world cup clash here saturday in which three players were sent off . the result means that all four teams in group e , which also includes ghana and the czech republic , still have a chance of making the last 16 . alberto gilardino gave italy the lead with a diving header , but an own goal by cristian zaccardo brought the usa back on level terms . us striker eddie johnson had caused a rumpus earlier in the week by comparing the world cup to war .

mcbride 's face was dripping with blood as de rossi headed down the tunnel with his head hung low . despite their numerical disadvantage , italy almost restored their lead but toni shot wide after sprinting clear of the usa defense . mastroeni then joined de rossi for an early bath following a late lunge on pirlo . pope lasted just 60 seconds of the second-half before the usa 's carlos bocanegra headed against his own bar . mcbride should have hit the target after being put clear by landon donovan and gianluca zambrotta drove wide for italy as play swung from end to end . del piero 's introduction lifted italy , but the two chances that fell his way were superbly stopped by keller . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de team usa takes on mighty azzuri in group e clash the united states will face italy in a world cup group e match in kaiserslautern on saturday and will be hoping to avoid a repeat of their crushing 0-3 defeat in the opener .

fan behavior has also come in for praise . so far , the only significant trouble came alongside wednesday 's germany-poland match in dortmund , where 430 people were detained briefly . " it shows that security forces trained just as hard for the world cup as the german national team did , " said jörg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal office , was quoted as telling the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung on saturday , adding he saw no indication of a terrorist threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg ziercke , president of germany 's federal criminal office " the police are very watchful and vigorous action is being taken consistently against troublemakers - as on wednesday in dortmund , " he added .
" i am firmly convinced that the games will remain peaceful . " alluding to possible activities by germany 's far right , ziercke said that " we will not meet with tolerance actions of intolerance against the state of law . " a string of attacks on nonwhites in the weeks before the world cup , particularly in germany 's formerly communist east , raised concerns ahead of the tournament .
it unleashed a debate about the existence of " no-go areas " in the east and some groups urged nonwhites to avoid the areas for their own safety . the debate threatened to mar the image germany hopes to project during the tournament , that of an open , tolerant and basically fun-loving society . praise for england another round of praise went to england 's fans , who are often the pariahs of international soccer due their reputation for hooliganism . this time , according to wolfgang niersbach , vice-president of the german organizing committee , the behaviour of england 's supporters has been one of the hightlights of the four-week tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans " by our estimates , there were 60,000 or 70,000 english fans in nuremberg for the match against trinidad & tobago and their exemplary behaviour was being discussed by many people , " he told reporters at fifa 's daily news briefing on friday . during the thursday game in nuremberg , only 26 england fans were detained by police before and after england 's 2-0 win . kevin miles , international coordinator for the -lrb- english -rrb- football supporters federation , told reuters his group has always maintained that the majority of england fans behave well for the majority of the time . " i am delighted to hear that excellent behaviour of england fans has been recognized by the authorities , " he said . niersbach also applauded the conduct of swedish fans in berlin for thursday 's match against paraguay , and the fact that many germans put on sweden 's yellow shirts in support of the scandinavians .

" he suffered a hit in the back during yesterday 's game and probably wo n't be fit to play against portugal , " iran 's coach branko ivankovic said monday after his team 's 3-1 defeat to mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali daei is set to miss the match against portugal daei , who once played for bayern munich and holds the world record for international goals , with 109 - more than both pele and ferenc puskas - is just the latest in iran 's contingent of bundesliga players to be hit by injury . mehdi mahdavikia and vahid hashemian were both recovering from knocks as they labored against mexico on sunday while bayern munich 's ali karimi had to be sent off after struggling for 55 minutes against mexico .
ferydoon zandi did not even make the bench . " we had some problems in the last two or three months .
karimi was playing his second game in three months , hashemian was out injured for two months and mahdavikia could n't practice for the last 10 days , " ivankovic said . " a terrible mistake " a sports professor who recently coached hanover in germany 's second division and led the iranian under-23 team to victory at the asian games four years ago , ivankovic has come under fire for iran 's performance against mexico , which has diminished iranian fans ' hopes of repeating the country 's one world cup success to date - a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's rahman rezei , left , heads the ball past mexico 's jared borgetti ivankovic was livid after defender rahman rezaei , whose leaping header had set up iran 's equalizer on sunday , allowed himself to be robbed on the edge of the penalty box for mexico to go up 2-1 . iran are now third in group d and have little chance of making the knock-out stages with games to come against portugal and angola . " we had a chance to do something today , we played very well especially in the first half and maybe we could have scored more than one goal , " ivankovic said after the defeat to mexico .
" we lost a goal through a terrible mistake in the defensive line , and of course after that it was much harder . " " a difficult game " portugal , however , is taking iran very seriously despite their 1-0 win over their first group d opponents angola . " it will be a difficult game .
we saw the first half against mexico and we saw iran playing very well , " portugal midfielder costinha said this week .
" they lost the first game so in this game they will play even harder because if they lose , it will be difficult for them to qualify , " costinha said , adding that the mexicans would be particularly watchful about strong midfield attacks from iran . but portugal suffered a mild shock this week when star winger christiano ronaldo , who plays for manchester united , left a practice session early , after complaining about his right hamstring .
portuguese soccer officials insisted that ronaldo was merely tired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's luis figo , left , and angola 's andre challenge for the ball but the portuguese can still count on a star line-up with deco - counted among the world 's best midfielders and nicknamed " the magic one " for his deadly free kicks and long passes - and captain luis figo , the two most experienced members of the team . figo , who turns 34 in november , proved his worth when he orchestrated the 1-0 win over angola by breaking through the defense to set up pauleta 's goal . portugal has its sights trained high for the world cup .

goals from cristiano ronaldo and deco sealed the victory . iran offered robust resistance for more than an hour before brazilian-born deco 's unstoppable opener .
cristiano ronaldo settled the matter with a penalty 10 minutes from the end . the win guarantees portugal 's progress from group d , while mexico and angola are both in contention for the other qualification spot .
it is the first time portugal has made it past the first round since 1966 , when eusebio inspired them to third place in england . after some bad-tempered exchanges , portugal 's class told in the 63rd minute . cutting in from the left , captain luis figo laid off to deco whose first-time shot sailed into the right corner , giving iran 's goalkeeper no chance . iran were not done and vahid hashemian 's powerful header forced a smart stop from ricardo . but it was all over when captain yahya golmohammadi sent his opposite number figo tumbling in the box , allowing ronaldo to step up and bury his penalty in the top right-hand corner . physical iran counter portugal 's flair with tough tackles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tricky ronaldo was on the end of some brutal treatment portugal were mostly on the attack throughout the game , enjoying the best of the action in an ill-tempered first period when some heavy challenges brought protests from coach luiz felipe scolari . portugal went close near half-time when miguel 's run and shot from an acute angle squirmed under goalkeeper ebrahim mirzapour and bounced across the face of goal . early on , figo picked out deco in the box but his fierce shot was palmed away .
figo also floated a free-kick to maniche but his volley from distance was headed over by the iranian defense . the trick-filled ronaldo enjoyed a busy first half , juggling the ball on the edge of the area at one point . he skimmed the outside of the post and blazed one over but cut a frustrated figure at half-time after a series of decisions went iran 's way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mercurial luis figo ran the game from midfield iran 's action was mainly restricted to set-pieces , although javad nekounam hit the post before being ruled offside . ronaldo continued to shine after the break , forcing a sharp save from mirzapour at his near post . pauleta tried to meet a nuno valente cross with the outside of his right boot but the flick flew over . at the other end , iran came close when a long ball found rasoul khatibi in the area but his shot went across the face of the goal . iran battled on until penalty broke resolve but portugal 's second goal broke iranian resolve and , with centre-half golmohammadi subbed off injured , they finished the match on the defensive . pauleta had a chance to increase his record goals tally in the final minutes but shot tamely , and ronaldo had a goal ruled out for offside on the whistle . portugal beat angola 1-0 in their opening game while iran went down 3-1 to mexico . portugal need only draw with mexico on wednesday to win the group . iran have now only won one world cup match in three visits , a 2-1 win over the united states in 1998 , but they have a chance to rectify that when they meet angola on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on track portugal meet embattled iran struggling to stay on in the tournament and missing captain and top-scorer ali daei , beleaguered iran face portugal in the group d match in frankfurt on saturday .

he said that he would appeal the ruling . easy to read , and fun the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by a traffic psychologist , karl peglau , when an increase in cars in the former east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim rossberg has said he 'll appeal the ruling peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

" i think they are ready to give a good effort . " giving no hints of the lineup changes he plans for saturday 's match , arena said he expects players to answer their wake-up call and play better then than they did in a 3-0 loss monday to the czech republic in a group e opener . us fears italian strikers " all we did is loose a game .
the challenge in any sport is how you respond , " arena said .
" naturally there is over-reaction in the short term .
if there is any kind of quality in the team , you bounce back . " but the us will need more than morale-boosting to perform against the azzuri , who thrashed ghana 2-0 in their first world cup game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's alberto gilardino poses a major threat to the us fiorentina striker luca toni and ac milan forward alberto gilardino are italy 's top threats , supported by some of best set-up men in the sport . " the guys we 're most concerned about are their two strikers , who are probably among the best tandem of strikers in the world cup , " arena said .
" both are tremendous finishers .
gilardino is a lethal finisher inside the box and he is in position all the time , " arena said .
" they have an excellent midfield .
if they sit back , you need to be patient , pick your chances , not get caught on the break .
they are going to be selective on how they attack you . " the us need at least one point to have a chance of advancing after crashing 3-0 to the czechs in their opener . more than just a game the americans are already looking forward to a world cup homecoming in kaiserslautern , which is close to a major us air base .
renamed " k-town " by the 55,000 american soldiers and their families stationed there who struggle to pronounce its german name , the smallest world cup venue is probably the most americanized city in europe . us striker eddie johnson said the encounter against italy is more than just another soccer game . " it 's like the world cup , we 're here for war , " johnson told reporters .
" we 're going to do what we gotta do .
you 've got to do things when the referee 's not looking .
you 've go to do what we have to do to get three points .
i do n't want to go home early . " us who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reyna 's the only face the italians can identify from the us squad the italians ' preparations for the game will have to start from scratch , with most players confessing complete ignorance about who they will be up again .
of three italian players asked what they knew about the american team , only midfielder andrea pirlo was able to name a single member of the squad . " there is -lrb- claudio -rrb- reyna , who plays in europe and then there is the other lad from psv eindhoven , " said pirlo , referring to midfielder damarcus beasley .

their style on the pitch may not match their style off it but the italians are always a force to be reckoned with and their world cup record speaks for itself .

he said that he would appeal the ruling . easy to read , and fun the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by a traffic psychologist , karl peglau , when an increase in cars in the former east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim rossberg has said he 'll appeal the ruling peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

in terms of sendings-off ; italy won , having only one man dismissed to usa 's two .
in between the goals and the cards , everything else possible happened . italy were held to a 1-1 draw by the usa in a bad-tempered world cup clash here saturday in which three players were sent off . the result means that all four teams in group e , which also includes ghana and the czech republic , still have a chance of making the last 16 . alberto gilardino gave italy the lead with a diving header , but an own goal by cristian zaccardo brought the usa back on level terms . us striker eddie johnson had caused a rumpus earlier in the week by comparing the world cup to war .
it was n't warfare , but this gripping contest was far from friendly . three-time world champions italy had daniele de rossi sent off in the 28th minute for elbowing brian mcbride and the usa 's pablo mastroeni shortly followed him down the tunnel for clattering into andrea pirlo . the americans were then reduced to nine men a minute after half time when eddie pope picked up his second yellow card .
it was only the fourth time in the history of the world cup that three players had been sent off in the same match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope 's second yellow meant usa finished with nine men kasey keller pulled off two excellent saves to deny italy substitute alessandro del piero in the closing stages as the usa bravely dug in to snatch a point . the result leaves the group wide open going into the final first round match with italy on four points , followed by the czech republic and ghana both on three and the usa on one . italy next face the czech republic in hamburg next thursday , while the usa take on ghana in nuremberg the same day . the americans , quarter-finalists four years ago , made life difficult for the italians in the first quarter of an hour , snapping into tackles and creating two half chances which bobby convey and dempsey wasted . italy absorbed the pressure and took the lead in the 22nd minute after pope 's foul on luca toni wide on the right . pirlo delivered a low centre into the box and gilardino stooped to steer the ball past a helpless keller with his forehead . italy 's joy lasted just five minutes with a defensive howler gifting the usa an equalizer . zaccardo swung a boot out wildly to try and clear convey 's crossed free-kick and succeeded only in diverting the ball past his own keeper , gianluigi buffon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brian mcbride recovered to threaten for the us in attack worse was to follow seconds later as de rossi was rightly sent off for elbowing mcbride in the face .
mcbride 's face was dripping with blood as de rossi headed down the tunnel with his head hung low . despite their numerical disadvantage , italy almost restored their lead but toni shot wide after sprinting clear of the usa defense . mastroeni then joined de rossi for an early bath following a late lunge on pirlo . pope lasted just 60 seconds of the second-half before the usa 's carlos bocanegra headed against his own bar . mcbride should have hit the target after being put clear by landon donovan and gianluca zambrotta drove wide for italy as play swung from end to end . del piero 's introduction lifted italy , but the two chances that fell his way were superbly stopped by keller . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de team usa takes on mighty azzuri in group e clash the united states will face italy in a world cup group e match in kaiserslautern on saturday and will be hoping to avoid a repeat of their crushing 0-3 defeat in the opener .

he said that he would appeal the ruling . easy to read , and fun the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by a traffic psychologist , karl peglau , when an increase in cars in the former east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim rossberg has said he 'll appeal the ruling peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he therefore deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible . after the fall of the berlin wall , the ampelmännchen acquired cult status . the authorities wanted to replace him with the standard western traffic sign , but residents of the former east launched a successful campaign to keep a part of their culture .
at the same time , the figure also became popular with tourists who could now freely travel to the former german democratic republic . ampelmännchen ltd was founded by markus heckhausen , a graphic designer from the western city of tübingen who moved to berlin . the court case has been seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country , in which the underdog east generally loses . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over .

christian group ekklesia said there should be a separation of the role of the church and state in weddings .
under its proposals , couples could specify the kind of legal commitment they wanted to make to each other .
they would still be able to register their partnership in law under a separate process .
' confused ' ekklesia said that the current situation was " confused " by attempts to fuse the christian and civil concepts of marriage onto a " one size fits all " arrangement .
it said its proposed framework would make a clearer distinction between religious marriage and those defined in law . "
religious communities are entitled to have their own ideal of marriage which they offer to the wider society .
but requiring others to accept this definition by law benefits no one " jonathan bartley director , ekklesia this would also give more clarity to the situation created by civil partnerships , which give gay and lesbian couples similar rights to heterosexual couples who marry , but does not convey the same legal status .
' failure ' director of the think-tank jonathan bartley said the plans were a response to the failure of marriage .
" legal marriage clearly is n't working .
a divorce rate of around 40 % is surely evidence enough of this , " he said .
" at the moment there is only one form of marriage defined under law , which everyone has to take or leave .
" it does not reflect christian ideas of marriage , which are based on a covenant before god , rather than a legal contract and agreement between individuals .
" and it does not properly acknowledge the reality of the existence of other , secular viewpoints , either .
he added : " religious communities are entitled to have their own ideal of marriage which they offer to the wider society .
but requiring others to accept this definition by law benefits no one .
it is confusing and counter-productive . "
the church of england has argued that granting legal rights to couples who co-habit undermines marriage .
mr bartley said : " if the church wants to argue that christian marriage , rooted in the grace of god , is preferable to civil cohabitation , it is free to do so .
" but there must surely be something wrong when the church 's defence of holy matrimony involves perpetuating what many will see as an unholy injustice against established live-in couples . "
what do you think of ekklesia 's ideas ?
do you think that the proposals undermine marriage ?
do you agree the concept of marriage should change as society changes ?
your comments : i am saddened that an organization that professes to hold christian values seems to have given up on traditional marriage .
however imperfect , this is god 's ideal whatever the forces of secular humanism say and so called christian liberals say .
mr bartley should spend more time studying how successful marriages work and promoting god 's ideal rather than trying to destroy it .
jeremy thompson , lansdale , usa why would someone need to have a wedding if they do not believe in holy matrimony ?
marriage is fundamentally a religious sacrament and the legal protections and privileges are only a recognition of this .
with the advent of civil partnerships it is entirely appropriate that marriage is reserved for those who believe in it .
let those who wish to live in sin do so .
vincent murphy , kuala lumpur , malaysia -lrb- ex uk -rrb- the abolishment of the legal marriage is just another way of eroding what is left of society .
this so called over paid think tank would be better employed sorting out the immigration and law and order problems in this country because it is blatantly obvious the government ca n't .
the fabric of society has already been substantially destroyed by idiots who think .
stop thinking up stupid schemes and lets have some action on the more important issues which are worsening by the minute .
mr j gumery , coventry , england even if 40 % of marriages fail -lrb- including my own -rrb- 60 % do not .
however marriage as we all know is not primarily about romance but the cold day to day living of two people and their children .
i suggest that a wedding should be split into two parts , one with the couple binding themselves to each other , much like a registry office ceremony but also with a compulsory written part dealing with finances especially pre nuptial agreements , possibly arrangements as to division of labour in the household etc .
if wished a separate religious wedding could then follow .
this would surely be in line with the teaching of the church and when there are split ups might help prevent a lot of the anger generated when the lawyers haggle and create even more problems david lindsay , richmond uk e-mail this to a friend related to this story : ' gay weddings ' become law in uk -lrb- 05 dec 05 -pipe- uk -rrb- q & a : civil partnership -lrb- 05 dec 05 -pipe- uk politics -rrb- related internet links church of england why marry ?

christian group ekklesia said there should be a separation of the role of the church and state in weddings .
under its proposals , couples could specify the kind of legal commitment they wanted to make to each other .
they would still be able to register their partnership in law under a separate process .
' confused ' ekklesia said that the current situation was " confused " by attempts to fuse the christian and civil concepts of marriage onto a " one size fits all " arrangement .
it said its proposed framework would make a clearer distinction between religious marriage and those defined in law .
religious communities are entitled to have their own ideal of marriage which they offer to the wider society .
but requiring others to accept this definition by law benefits no one jonathan bartley director , ekklesia this would also give more clarity to the situation created by civil partnerships , which give gay and lesbian couples similar rights to heterosexual couples who marry , but does not convey the same legal status .
' failure ' director of the think-tank jonathan bartley said the plans were a response to the failure of marriage .
" legal marriage clearly is n't working .
a divorce rate of around 40 % is surely evidence enough of this , " he said .
" at the moment there is only one form of marriage defined under law , which everyone has to take or leave .
" it does not reflect christian ideas of marriage , which are based on a covenant before god , rather than a legal contract and agreement between individuals .
" and it does not properly acknowledge the reality of the existence of other , secular viewpoints , either .
he added : " religious communities are entitled to have their own ideal of marriage which they offer to the wider society .
but requiring others to accept this definition by law benefits no one .
it is confusing and counter-productive . "
the church of england has argued that granting legal rights to couples who co-habit undermines marriage .
mr bartley said : " if the church wants to argue that christian marriage , rooted in the grace of god , is preferable to civil cohabitation , it is free to do so .
" but there must surely be something wrong when the church 's defence of holy matrimony involves perpetuating what many will see as an unholy injustice against established live-in couples . "

jeremy thompson , lansdale , usa why would someone need to have a wedding if they do not believe in holy matrimony ?

christian group ekklesia said there should be a separation of the role of the church and state in weddings .
under its proposals , couples could specify the kind of legal commitment they wanted to make to each other .
they would still be able to register their partnership in law under a separate process .
' confused ' ekklesia said that the current situation was " confused " by attempts to fuse the christian and civil concepts of marriage onto a " one size fits all " arrangement .
it said its proposed framework would make a clearer distinction between religious marriage and those defined in law .
religious communities are entitled to have their own ideal of marriage which they offer to the wider society .
but requiring others to accept this definition by law benefits no one jonathan bartley director , ekklesia this would also give more clarity to the situation created by civil partnerships , which give gay and lesbian couples similar rights to heterosexual couples who marry , but does not convey the same legal status .
' failure ' director of the think-tank jonathan bartley said the plans were a response to the failure of marriage .
" legal marriage clearly is n't working .
a divorce rate of around 40 % is surely evidence enough of this , " he said .
" at the moment there is only one form of marriage defined under law , which everyone has to take or leave .
" it does not reflect christian ideas of marriage , which are based on a covenant before god , rather than a legal contract and agreement between individuals .
" and it does not properly acknowledge the reality of the existence of other , secular viewpoints , either .
he added : " religious communities are entitled to have their own ideal of marriage which they offer to the wider society .
but requiring others to accept this definition by law benefits no one .
it is confusing and counter-productive . "
the church of england has argued that granting legal rights to couples who co-habit undermines marriage .
mr bartley said : " if the church wants to argue that christian marriage , rooted in the grace of god , is preferable to civil cohabitation , it is free to do so .
" but there must surely be something wrong when the church 's defence of holy matrimony involves perpetuating what many will see as an unholy injustice against established live-in couples . "
what do you think of ekklesia 's ideas ?
do you think that the proposals undermine marriage ?
do you agree the concept of marriage should change as society changes ?
your comments : i am saddened that an organization that professes to hold christian values seems to have given up on traditional marriage .
however imperfect , this is god 's ideal whatever the forces of secular humanism say and so called christian liberals say .
mr bartley should spend more time studying how successful marriages work and promoting god 's ideal rather than trying to destroy it .
jeremy thompson , lansdale , usa why would someone need to have a wedding if they do not believe in holy matrimony ?
marriage is fundamentally a religious sacrament and the legal protections and privileges are only a recognition of this .
with the advent of civil partnerships it is entirely appropriate that marriage is reserved for those who believe in it .
let those who wish to live in sin do so .
vincent murphy , kuala lumpur , malaysia -lrb- ex uk -rrb- the abolishment of the legal marriage is just another way of eroding what is left of society .
this so called over paid think tank would be better employed sorting out the immigration and law and order problems in this country because it is blatantly obvious the government ca n't .
the fabric of society has already been substantially destroyed by idiots who think .
stop thinking up stupid schemes and lets have some action on the more important issues which are worsening by the minute .
mr j gumery , coventry , england even if 40 % of marriages fail -lrb- including my own -rrb- 60 % do not .
however marriage as we all know is not primarily about romance but the cold day to day living of two people and their children .
i suggest that a wedding should be split into two parts , one with the couple binding themselves to each other , much like a registry office ceremony but also with a compulsory written part dealing with finances especially pre nuptial agreements , possibly arrangements as to division of labour in the household etc .
if wished a separate religious wedding could then follow .
this would surely be in line with the teaching of the church and when there are split ups might help prevent a lot of the anger generated when the lawyers haggle and create even more problems david lindsay , richmond uk e-mail this to a friend printable version see also ' gay weddings ' become law in uk 05 dec 05 -pipe- uk q & a : civil partnership 05 dec 05 -pipe- uk politics related bbc links why marry ?

assistant commissioner andy hayman was made a cbe in the honours list .
it comes days after he apologised to two brothers who were freed without charge a week after the raid .
but the chairman of the commons home affairs select committee , john denham , said the honours decision would have been taken months ago .
mr hayman is assistant commissioner at the metropolitan police 's special operations unit , which is responsible for anti-terrorism investigations .
he has been praised for his response to the july 7 terror attacks .
' exceptional circumstances ' liberal democrats home affairs spokesman nick clegg said there may have been a " wider case " to award mr hayman for his service to the police .
but given the " exceptional circumstances " of the forest gate operation , he said , there was a " strong case " to have given more thought to the timing of the award .
" enormous anger and anxiety " still existed in the local community , mr clegg argued .

" i think in practice it 's pretty difficult with something like the honours system to start saying perhaps it should have been postponed at the last moment .
that would have been misinterpreted in an equally damaging way . "
some 250 officers were involved in the forest gate operation , which resulted in two brothers being arrested .
insensitive mohammed abdulkahar , 23 , and abul koyair , 20 , were questioned under terrorism laws for a week before being freed without charge .
mr abdulkahar , who was shot in the shoulder , has said he thought he was going to be killed by robbers targeting his home .
asad rehman , who has spoken in the past for the menezes family and the two men arrested at forest gate , called the timing of the award " insensitive " .
he said there were " issues still outstanding " regarding the menezes inquiry , and " many , many questions " over the forest gate raid .

mr kennedy spoke to bbc south west 's political editor chris rogers in newton abbot in devon earlier this week .
mr kennedy said while he follows the convention of not commenting publicly on his successor , he does give advice in private to sir menzies campbell .
mr kennedy was in the town to open the new lib dem constituency offices .
i do n't think it was wrong to want to stand again charles kennedy it was an opportunity to reflect on the events of six months ago , when a volatile period of speculation about his leadership style and performance culminated in his announcement of a leadership election .
" i have n't written any memoirs , but looking back there was an assumption that maybe we should have a change of leader without having a leadership election , " he said .
" in an area like the south west , with such a big membership and with one member , one vote , i think that would have been very demoralising .
" the penultimate decision i took as leader was to trigger a leadership election .
i was very pleased when that happened because it gives legitimacy to the new leader and the election re-invigorated the party . "
however , that in turn generated even more aggravation in the party as mps and activists alike came forward to either endorse his bid to stand again or demand he withdrew his name to allow a fresh start .
" i do n't think it was wrong to want to stand again .
that was my view at the time and was the view of the vast majority of messages i was getting . "
but two south west mps in particular said no .
one was nick harvey in north devon , a senior campaigner who thought the view was untenable .
the other , st ives mp andrew george , threatened to resign his front bench post shadowing international development unless kennedy withdrew .
the pressure proved overwhelming .
" i 've been in parliament long enough to recognise parliamentary reality , that if you do n't feel you carry sufficient confidence with your parliamentary colleagues , as i could n't at that time , then you have to make way for others . "
it was a crushing blow and remains his one regret .
" i would have liked to contest the leadership election , because there is now a question mark in the air which members could have decided , had my name been on the ballot paper . "
now he gives every impression of having come to terms with his new role , on the backbench but supportive of the party and particularly the new leader .
there 's a modern liberal democrat convention of a departing leader offering full support and no comment on his successor , for fear of being misrepresented .
but things are different in private .
the kennedy 's son was born last april " of course i do offer face-to-face advice to ming .
we 've known each other for nearly thirty years and we speak as friends and colleagues as we have always done .
" it 's a two-way process and nothing changes , but it 's done in private . "
he says he supports the review of party policies , especially taxation policy , not least because he started the process and the party ca n't stand still .
earlier , looking relaxed on a blazing june day , mr kennedy had spent an hour at the new complex in exeter which is the national headquarters of the met office .
he said he was on a fact-finding mission and brushed off the suggestion that he might be in line for a front bench environment job .
" i 'm in the happy position of not being in search of titles , posts or positions .
i 've more or less done it all and there 's not much left to go for .
reasons to be cheerful " i can do what interests me and i wanted to spend time at the met office seeing what they can input to the debate on climate change . "
it 's a luxury usually denied a leader on a treadmill of politically necessary public visits .
many old hands sympathised with his personal battle with drink that kicked off his eventual fall from the top job .
he can never forget , but he can progress .
he gives every impression of having re-discovered the really important things , his wife , a baby son and a proper perspective on politics .
" i was in good health when i resigned , i said i would remain in good health , and i am .
i have every reason , personally and politically , to be cheerful and that 's the way i 'm going to keep it . "

" i would have liked to contest the leadership election , because there is now a question mark in the air which members could have decided , had my name been on the ballot paper . "
now he gives every impression of having come to terms with his new role , on the backbench but supportive of the party and particularly the new leader .
there 's a modern liberal democrat convention of a departing leader offering full support and no comment on his successor , for fear of being misrepresented .
but things are different in private .
the kennedy 's son was born last april " of course i do offer face-to-face advice to ming .
we 've known each other for nearly thirty years and we speak as friends and colleagues as we have always done .
" it 's a two-way process and nothing changes , but it 's done in private . "
he says he supports the review of party policies , especially taxation policy , not least because he started the process and the party ca n't stand still .
earlier , looking relaxed on a blazing june day , mr kennedy had spent an hour at the new complex in exeter which is the national headquarters of the met office .
he said he was on a fact-finding mission and brushed off the suggestion that he might be in line for a front bench environment job .
" i 'm in the happy position of not being in search of titles , posts or positions .
i 've more or less done it all and there 's not much left to go for .
reasons to be cheerful " i can do what interests me and i wanted to spend time at the met office seeing what they can input to the debate on climate change . "
it 's a luxury usually denied a leader on a treadmill of politically necessary public visits .
many old hands sympathised with his personal battle with drink that kicked off his eventual fall from the top job .
he can never forget , but he can progress .
he gives every impression of having re-discovered the really important things , his wife , a baby son and a proper perspective on politics .
" i was in good health when i resigned , i said i would remain in good health , and i am .
i have every reason , personally and politically , to be cheerful and that 's the way i 'm going to keep it . "

his comments come as more than 1,000 labour members and activists meet in london to discuss renewing the party .
ministers , trade unionists and campaign leaders are addressing a conference , organised by left-wing group compass .
mr meacher said : " we have lost half of our members and four million voters since 1997 .
this is a very serious problem . "
the yougov poll suggests 71 % of current and former labour members want tony blair to step down as prime minister before autumn 2007 .
" they said the leadership did not trust its members sufficiently to involve them fully in party decisions and policy-making , " mr meacher said .
" even when the government does consult , it gives no indication whatsoever that it listens to what is said or modifies its policies .
" it 's that that gets up the noses of lots of members .
ministerial line-up compass has named its conference after the late robin cook .
the group is headed by former adviser to gordon brown , neal lawson , and recently pressed for a timetable for mr blair 's departure from downing street .
that prompted cabinet minister john reid to call compass an " old labour lobby group " while mr blair said its policies were the surest route to opposition .
but a range of ministers are addressing the conference , including labour chairman hazel blears , international development secretary hilary benn and chief brownite ally and minister ed balls .
compass plans to issue a manifesto at the end of the year following a number of what it calls renewal roadshows - which its organisers say will try to assess the political moment and the political times .
but the conference also follows the frenzy of speculation over the labour leadership , with commons leader jack straw predicting mr blair will leave " well before " the next election .
' unaccountable ' mr meacher , who heads the independent labour commission , was due to present the findings of the new yougov opinion poll to the conference .
it suggests 71 % of them want mr blair to go before next year 's labour conference and more than a third , 37 % , want him to quit in the next three months .
but the poll suggests a majority do not think deputy prime minister john prescott should stand down until mr blair departs .
mr meacher will focus on poll findings which show a majority of those questioned want labour 's manifesto to be put to a vote of members before general elections .
and 64 % of those questioned said they thought the party leadership did not trust members to get involved in drawing up policies .
mr meacher said : " the biggest single issue in britain today is the lack of accountability of political power .
" the checks and balances requiring the prime minister to consult and listen have been all but eliminated . "
he said the labour commission would now prepare proposals on how to meet the demands .
labour has highlighted its efforts to try to improve links with party members in recent years with a series of consultation events .

the special operations troops stripped inmates naked and drenched them with water before interrogation in overly air-conditioned rooms , it said .
the report , by brig gen richard formica , says troops were not to blame - they had received the wrong advice .
it is the latest in a series of inquiries into the alleged abuse or killing of iraqis by coalition forces .
several us soldiers have been jailed for their role in abusing inmates at baghdad 's abu ghraib prison .
images of the abuse caused an international outcry - but most defendants say they were following orders .
' no intent ' gen formica 's report was completed in november 2004 .
it was released for the first time on friday following a request by the american civil liberties union .
other instances of abuse included : prisoners locked for as many as seven days in cells so small they could neither stand nor lie down loud music played into the cells prisoners made to kneel for long periods gen formica said the abuse at the hands of the troops from the combined joint special operations task force - arabian peninsula had occurred from february to may 2004 .
they had based their interrogation on policy guidance from september 2003 - which was rescinded a month later by the then top us commander in iraq , lt gen ricardo sanchez .
the soldiers believed the techniques had been approved , the 75-page , heavily redacted report says .
gen formica said what the troops had done was wrong , but it did not amount to deliberate abuse .
" i did n't find cruel and malicious criminals that are out there looking for detainees to abuse , " gen formica told reporters on friday .
he said it was regrettable that the soldiers had been given the wrong policy .
but a lawyer for aclu said the report demonstrated that the abuse was " widespread and systemic " .
the abu ghraib scandal came to light in april 2004 after images emerged of us troops abusing prisoners .
the footage included naked prisoners placed in humiliating positions and detainees cowering from aggressive dogs .
eleven us soldiers have been convicted in connection with the abu ghraib abuse .

judge anthony ferrara ridiculed the star for saying he could hold a make-up workshop as part of his punishment .
a lawyer for the singer - real name george o 'dowd - insisted he was trying to arrange something more worthwhile than sweeping streets in manhattan .
a further hearing on 26 june will rule if he broke the terms of his sentence .
o 'dowd , who turned 45 on wednesday , admitted wasting police time over an incident last october .
he had been arrested after police were called to his home in new york .
he received a sentence of five days of community service and a fine of $ 1,000 -lrb- £ 540 -rrb- .
a charge of possessing cocaine was dropped .
arrest warrant judge ferrara went as far as to issue an arrest warrant for o 'dowd because he did not appear in person to explain why he had refused to begin his community service .
however , he said he would not order an arrest until next week 's hearing , giving o 'dowd a further opportunity to attend the court .
he does n't serve himself well by not paying the fine .
we know he has the means judge anthony ferrara he also ridiculed the singer 's proposals to help teenagers create a public service announcement , stage a fashion and make-up workshop and play a dj set at a benefit for aids sufferers .
lawyer louis freeman said o 'dowd hoped to do something other than sweeping pavements .
" there 's nothing wrong with that if that 's part of his punishment , but it will turn into a media circus , and the press will be following him every day , " he said .
the judge said he understood the objection to street cleaning - " it 's humiliation , " he conceded - but claimed o 'dowd " took a deal that had an element of humiliation " .
" i put people in jail who do n't pay fines , he said .

poor or struggling teachers face being placed on probation for a year , although support would be provided to help bring them up to standard .
failure to do so could see them being dismissed under a scheme which has been approved by education minister peter peacock .
only nine teachers have been sacked for incompetence in the past five years .
this is despite councils having more powers to dismiss those who are under-performing . "
teachers would be able to ask for help to improve or be required to participate in a structured personal development programme " scottish executive spokesman mr peacock said that , although most teachers in scotland were performing well , he was concerned about the small minority who were not having a significant impact on pupil education .
a scottish executive spokesman said : " the minister is looking at new ways to ensure that teachers who are struggling to meet required standards have their development requirements addressed in a transparent and fair way .
" teachers would be able to ask for help to improve or be required to participate in a structured personal development programme to reach required standards .
" only when it is clear that they have not developed sufficiently would they be assisted to find new careers . "
further action council education committees used to be responsible for sacking bad teachers , but the process was seen as being too complex .
four years ago , the power passed to education directors , but it is understood the minister believes further action is still needed .
the probationary idea stems from the success of a teacher induction scheme .
this sees new recruits given a year-long placement in a school during which time they are supported by an experienced member of staff .
plans to give the general teaching council for scotland increased powers to remove sacked teachers permanently from the register have already been announced by the minister .
at present , teachers sacked by one local authority are able to get a job at a school elsewhere in the country .

that warning has been given by the boss of the organisation representing almost all the pension funds in the uk .
christine farnish said the napf supported government plans to review the rules surrounding company pensions , which she said were the toughest in the world .
but the tuc told bbc radio 4 's money box programme it was unacceptable for employers to renege on promises they had made and which their staff were relying on . "
i 'd like there to be a regime in future where there was more discretion so that schemes can stay open rather than close " christine farnish , napf pensions policy officer michelle lewis warned that any more damage to the reputation of pension funds could add to the huge mistrust already surrounding them which would take years to rebuild .
however , christine farnish told the programme that raising pensions each year in line with inflation was very expensive .
" we are the only country in the world that forces companies who offer salary-related pensions to index them in payment .
it has added about 30 % to the cost of doing it , " she said .
and she said if there was no change , pension schemes could shut down : " i 'd like there to be a regime in future where there was more discretion so that schemes can stay open rather than close .
" we 're not talking about savagely taking away promises from people just getting back to a regime that 's going to be able to continue . "
' pension promise ' but the tuc 's michelle lewis warned against taking away benefits that were already part of the scheme : " people have been made a pension promise by their employer .
" they have contributed to pensions schemes over their working lives and they deserve to get what -lsb- they see as -rsb- deferred pay when they come to retire . "
but she stressed the tuc was not arguing against any change at all .
bbc radio 4 's money box bbc radio 4 's money box was broadcast on saturday , 17 june 2006 , at 1204 bst .
" we are not saying schemes should n't sit down with their trade unions and scheme members and talk about the future of the scheme , but not making changes that have already been built up and certainly not trying to stop inflation-proofing pensions in payment , " she said .
but that could be precisely what the government has in mind .
its pensions white paper , published in may , said it would launch a " review of pensions regulation " which could " remove ... legal requirements " and could " include re-examining ... mandatory indexation of pensions in payment " .
and speaking to the national association of pension funds on 8 june , pensions secretary john hutton said the items mentioned for review in the white paper were " a minimum of what we are prepared to consider ...
nothing is off the table . "
