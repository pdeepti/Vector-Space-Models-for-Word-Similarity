program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : christmas in germany americans taking bigger bite of german christmas fare berliners celebrate new shopping hours saint nicholas : the bearded legend germany 's christmas markets : all that is filling and festive culture -pipe- 03.12.2006 a home for angels in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man 's best friend ?
angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .
he has not catalogued them in any particular way , so kitsch and tacky angels stand side-by-side with more artistic ones or sacred pieces , a plump cheeky cherub might be randomly placed next to an angry knight brandishing a sword .
there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .
since then , visitor numbers have soared .
unfortunately , fischer can not keep up .
his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .
" the pleasure people get is indescribable - not only at christmas but the whole year round .
that 's why i want to make sure the angels are in good hands before i die . " dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's next moma ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 03.12.2006 bulgarian eu commissioner to take on consumer protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bulgaria prepares for accession to the eu , its first commissioner readies for her new job meglena kuneva has been bulgarian minister for european affairs since 2002 .
now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .
he has not catalogued them in any particular way , so kitsch and tacky angels stand side-by-side with more artistic ones or sacred pieces , a plump cheeky cherub might be randomly placed next to an angry knight brandishing a sword .
there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .
since then , visitor numbers have soared .
unfortunately , fischer can not keep up .
his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .
" the pleasure people get is indescribable - not only at christmas but the whole year round .
that 's why i want to make sure the angels are in good hands before i die . " dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's next moma ?

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .
he has not catalogued them in any particular way , so kitsch and tacky angels stand side-by-side with more artistic ones or sacred pieces , a plump cheeky cherub might be randomly placed next to an angry knight brandishing a sword .
there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .
since then , visitor numbers have soared .
unfortunately , fischer can not keep up .
his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .

in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot . " destabilization of lebanon on no-one 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-siniora media have called the protests a coup attempt the destabilization of lebanon was in not in the interest of anyone inside or outside lebanon , he said .
" for this reason the european union and especially germany is exerting all its efforts to help lebanon and to secure a ceasefire on the border " with israel . german naval troops continued to monitor lebanon 's coast and the german government had offered equipment and training to border personnel as well as 80 million euros in aid , he added . upon his arrival at the airport , steinmeier handed over scanners to customs officers for searching goods coming into the country .
germany has also supplied lebanon with shipping vehicles and computers for use in border monitoring . the german naval contingent is part of a un force entrusted with monitoring the coast to prevent any arms shipment to hezbollah in line with un security council resolution 1701 that ended a month-long war between israel and hezbollah this summer . in beirut , steinmeier also held what he described as " very positive talks " with the pro-syrian parliament speaker nabih berri , who is a close ally of hezbollah . west critcizes attempts to unseat siniora 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors remain on the streets of beirut meanwhile , lebanon 's western-backed cabinet vowed not to cave in to calls to resign as the political deadlock which has nearly paralyzed state institutions amid a fierce struggle for supremacy between pro- and anti-syrian camps within the power-sharing regime tightened . the stand-off has prompted concern and criticism from western nations eager for lebanon to remain under the control of the siniora government . us state department spokesman tom casey said washington denounced what he called " threats of intimidation or violence " which " are aimed at toppling lebanon 's legitimate and democratically elected government " . british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who also held talks with siniora saturday , expressed her support for his government .
" we call on all parties to work together for the good of lebanon , and to return to dialogue , " she said . arab league chief amr mussa was to hold talks in beirut on sunday to offer his services as a mediator , arab diplomats said .
the saudi ambassador mediated between the two sides late friday and brokered the reopening of some access roads to siniora 's offices . lebanese deadlock attributed to hariri tribunal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafik hariri 's murder is a scar that wo n't heal siniora appealed saturday for renewed talks with the opposition over a deadlock which threatens to block the government 's legislative program , including its centerpiece plans for an international tribunal to try the suspects in the murder of his predecessor rafiq hariri 's murder , in which syria has been implicated . the opposition spearheaded by hezbollah is demanding a greater say in the government , which it charges has been riding roughshod over the power-sharing arrangements in force since lebanon 's devastating 1975-90 civil war . but the anti-damascus camp says the opposition demands are a ploy at the behest of their syrian sponsors to avoid the formation of the proposed international tribunal to try suspects in the hariri murder . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon protests threaten to derail steinmeier 's mid-east tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meets palestinian president abbas saturday .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot . " destabilization of lebanon on no-one 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-siniora media have called the protests a coup attempt the destabilization of lebanon was in not in the interest of anyone inside or outside lebanon , he said .
" for this reason the european union and especially germany is exerting all its efforts to help lebanon and to secure a ceasefire on the border " with israel . german naval troops continued to monitor lebanon 's coast and the german government had offered equipment and training to border personnel as well as 80 million euros in aid , he added . upon his arrival at the airport , steinmeier handed over scanners to customs officers for searching goods coming into the country .
germany has also supplied lebanon with shipping vehicles and computers for use in border monitoring . the german naval contingent is part of a un force entrusted with monitoring the coast to prevent any arms shipment to hezbollah in line with un security council resolution 1701 that ended a month-long war between israel and hezbollah this summer . in beirut , steinmeier also held what he described as " very positive talks " with the pro-syrian parliament speaker nabih berri , who is a close ally of hezbollah . west critcizes attempts to unseat siniora 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors remain on the streets of beirut meanwhile , lebanon 's western-backed cabinet vowed not to cave in to calls to resign as the political deadlock which has nearly paralyzed state institutions amid a fierce struggle for supremacy between pro- and anti-syrian camps within the power-sharing regime tightened . the stand-off has prompted concern and criticism from western nations eager for lebanon to remain under the control of the siniora government . us state department spokesman tom casey said washington denounced what he called " threats of intimidation or violence " which " are aimed at toppling lebanon 's legitimate and democratically elected government " . british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who also held talks with siniora saturday , expressed her support for his government .
" we call on all parties to work together for the good of lebanon , and to return to dialogue , " she said . arab league chief amr mussa was to hold talks in beirut on sunday to offer his services as a mediator , arab diplomats said .
the saudi ambassador mediated between the two sides late friday and brokered the reopening of some access roads to siniora 's offices . lebanese deadlock attributed to hariri tribunal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafik hariri 's murder is a scar that wo n't heal siniora appealed saturday for renewed talks with the opposition over a deadlock which threatens to block the government 's legislative program , including its centerpiece plans for an international tribunal to try the suspects in the murder of his predecessor rafiq hariri 's murder , in which syria has been implicated . the opposition spearheaded by hezbollah is demanding a greater say in the government , which it charges has been riding roughshod over the power-sharing arrangements in force since lebanon 's devastating 1975-90 civil war . but the anti-damascus camp says the opposition demands are a ploy at the behest of their syrian sponsors to avoid the formation of the proposed international tribunal to try suspects in the hariri murder . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon protests threaten to derail steinmeier 's mid-east tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meets palestinian president abbas saturday .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot . " destabilization of lebanon on no-one 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-siniora media have called the protests a coup attempt the destabilization of lebanon was in not in the interest of anyone inside or outside lebanon , he said .
" for this reason the european union and especially germany is exerting all its efforts to help lebanon and to secure a ceasefire on the border " with israel . german naval troops continued to monitor lebanon 's coast and the german government had offered equipment and training to border personnel as well as 80 million euros in aid , he added . upon his arrival at the airport , steinmeier handed over scanners to customs officers for searching goods coming into the country .
germany has also supplied lebanon with shipping vehicles and computers for use in border monitoring . the german naval contingent is part of a un force entrusted with monitoring the coast to prevent any arms shipment to hezbollah in line with un security council resolution 1701 that ended a month-long war between israel and hezbollah this summer . in beirut , steinmeier also held what he described as " very positive talks " with the pro-syrian parliament speaker nabih berri , who is a close ally of hezbollah . west critcizes attempts to unseat siniora 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors remain on the streets of beirut meanwhile , lebanon 's western-backed cabinet vowed not to cave in to calls to resign as the political deadlock which has nearly paralyzed state institutions amid a fierce struggle for supremacy between pro- and anti-syrian camps within the power-sharing regime tightened . the stand-off has prompted concern and criticism from western nations eager for lebanon to remain under the control of the siniora government . us state department spokesman tom casey said washington denounced what he called " threats of intimidation or violence " which " are aimed at toppling lebanon 's legitimate and democratically elected government " . british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who also held talks with siniora saturday , expressed her support for his government .
" we call on all parties to work together for the good of lebanon , and to return to dialogue , " she said . arab league chief amr mussa was to hold talks in beirut on sunday to offer his services as a mediator , arab diplomats said .
the saudi ambassador mediated between the two sides late friday and brokered the reopening of some access roads to siniora 's offices . lebanese deadlock attributed to hariri tribunal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafik hariri 's murder is a scar that wo n't heal siniora appealed saturday for renewed talks with the opposition over a deadlock which threatens to block the government 's legislative program , including its centerpiece plans for an international tribunal to try the suspects in the murder of his predecessor rafiq hariri 's murder , in which syria has been implicated . the opposition spearheaded by hezbollah is demanding a greater say in the government , which it charges has been riding roughshod over the power-sharing arrangements in force since lebanon 's devastating 1975-90 civil war . but the anti-damascus camp says the opposition demands are a ploy at the behest of their syrian sponsors to avoid the formation of the proposed international tribunal to try suspects in the hariri murder . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon protests threaten to derail steinmeier 's mid-east tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meets palestinian president abbas saturday .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot . " destabilization of lebanon on no-one 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-siniora media have called the protests a coup attempt the destabilization of lebanon was in not in the interest of anyone inside or outside lebanon , he said .
" for this reason the european union and especially germany is exerting all its efforts to help lebanon and to secure a ceasefire on the border " with israel . german naval troops continued to monitor lebanon 's coast and the german government had offered equipment and training to border personnel as well as 80 million euros in aid , he added . upon his arrival at the airport , steinmeier handed over scanners to customs officers for searching goods coming into the country .
germany has also supplied lebanon with shipping vehicles and computers for use in border monitoring . the german naval contingent is part of a un force entrusted with monitoring the coast to prevent any arms shipment to hezbollah in line with un security council resolution 1701 that ended a month-long war between israel and hezbollah this summer . in beirut , steinmeier also held what he described as " very positive talks " with the pro-syrian parliament speaker nabih berri , who is a close ally of hezbollah . west critcizes attempts to unseat siniora 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors remain on the streets of beirut meanwhile , lebanon 's western-backed cabinet vowed not to cave in to calls to resign as the political deadlock which has nearly paralyzed state institutions amid a fierce struggle for supremacy between pro- and anti-syrian camps within the power-sharing regime tightened . the stand-off has prompted concern and criticism from western nations eager for lebanon to remain under the control of the siniora government . us state department spokesman tom casey said washington denounced what he called " threats of intimidation or violence " which " are aimed at toppling lebanon 's legitimate and democratically elected government " . british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who also held talks with siniora saturday , expressed her support for his government .
" we call on all parties to work together for the good of lebanon , and to return to dialogue , " she said . arab league chief amr mussa was to hold talks in beirut on sunday to offer his services as a mediator , arab diplomats said .
the saudi ambassador mediated between the two sides late friday and brokered the reopening of some access roads to siniora 's offices . lebanese deadlock attributed to hariri tribunal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafik hariri 's murder is a scar that wo n't heal siniora appealed saturday for renewed talks with the opposition over a deadlock which threatens to block the government 's legislative program , including its centerpiece plans for an international tribunal to try the suspects in the murder of his predecessor rafiq hariri 's murder , in which syria has been implicated . the opposition spearheaded by hezbollah is demanding a greater say in the government , which it charges has been riding roughshod over the power-sharing arrangements in force since lebanon 's devastating 1975-90 civil war . but the anti-damascus camp says the opposition demands are a ploy at the behest of their syrian sponsors to avoid the formation of the proposed international tribunal to try suspects in the hariri murder . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon protests threaten to derail steinmeier 's mid-east tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meets palestinian president abbas saturday .
but steinmeier 's visit to beirut is in doubt after pro-syria and hezbollah supporters laid siege to government buildings .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot . " destabilization of lebanon on no-one 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-siniora media have called the protests a coup attempt the destabilization of lebanon was in not in the interest of anyone inside or outside lebanon , he said .
" for this reason the european union and especially germany is exerting all its efforts to help lebanon and to secure a ceasefire on the border " with israel . german naval troops continued to monitor lebanon 's coast and the german government had offered equipment and training to border personnel as well as 80 million euros in aid , he added . upon his arrival at the airport , steinmeier handed over scanners to customs officers for searching goods coming into the country .
germany has also supplied lebanon with shipping vehicles and computers for use in border monitoring . the german naval contingent is part of a un force entrusted with monitoring the coast to prevent any arms shipment to hezbollah in line with un security council resolution 1701 that ended a month-long war between israel and hezbollah this summer . in beirut , steinmeier also held what he described as " very positive talks " with the pro-syrian parliament speaker nabih berri , who is a close ally of hezbollah . west critcizes attempts to unseat siniora 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors remain on the streets of beirut meanwhile , lebanon 's western-backed cabinet vowed not to cave in to calls to resign as the political deadlock which has nearly paralyzed state institutions amid a fierce struggle for supremacy between pro- and anti-syrian camps within the power-sharing regime tightened . the stand-off has prompted concern and criticism from western nations eager for lebanon to remain under the control of the siniora government . us state department spokesman tom casey said washington denounced what he called " threats of intimidation or violence " which " are aimed at toppling lebanon 's legitimate and democratically elected government " . british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who also held talks with siniora saturday , expressed her support for his government .
" we call on all parties to work together for the good of lebanon , and to return to dialogue , " she said . arab league chief amr mussa was to hold talks in beirut on sunday to offer his services as a mediator , arab diplomats said .
the saudi ambassador mediated between the two sides late friday and brokered the reopening of some access roads to siniora 's offices . lebanese deadlock attributed to hariri tribunal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafik hariri 's murder is a scar that wo n't heal siniora appealed saturday for renewed talks with the opposition over a deadlock which threatens to block the government 's legislative program , including its centerpiece plans for an international tribunal to try the suspects in the murder of his predecessor rafiq hariri 's murder , in which syria has been implicated . the opposition spearheaded by hezbollah is demanding a greater say in the government , which it charges has been riding roughshod over the power-sharing arrangements in force since lebanon 's devastating 1975-90 civil war . but the anti-damascus camp says the opposition demands are a ploy at the behest of their syrian sponsors to avoid the formation of the proposed international tribunal to try suspects in the hariri murder . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon protests threaten to derail steinmeier 's mid-east tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meets palestinian president abbas saturday .

1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .

one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .

1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .

there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .

there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .

his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 03.12.2006 bulgarian eu commissioner to take on consumer protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bulgaria prepares for accession to the eu , its first commissioner readies for her new job meglena kuneva has been bulgarian minister for european affairs since 2002 .
now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

airport officials had announced that passengers should be prepared for changes aimed at preventing liquid explosives from being the next weapon of choice for terrorists .
carry-on liquids now have to be kept in 100-milliliter containers in sealed plastic bags and each person can not bring along more than one liter in total . but the full effect was n't apparent until going through airport security myself . excessive plastic and waste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do the discarded bottles end up as landfill ? at cologne airport on a flight to paris , i was given a sealable bag at the service desk for the deodorant , toothpaste and perfume i was carrying .
my bag came from a massive box holding thousands of sealable bags for travelers who did n't come prepared . long lines of anxious , friday morning travelers were waiting at the security checkpoint to have their bags searched and scanned - and their bodies patted down . i was told to throw away my drink bottle .
it was only 6:30 a.m. and the bin where my bottle was discarded was already full of containers , many unopened .
i wondered what would happen to the tons of unnecessary waste . although i was not bothered by the security hold-ups and having to remove my boots and belt , the worst part was getting frisked rather aggressively and invasively with a large audience of passengers behind me . cologne to paris was bothersome considering the wait and the public groping .
but it was definitely carefree compared to the return journey from charles de gaulle airport . paris airport disaster my toothpaste , deodorant and perfume were not in a sealable bag when i passed through security checks in paris .
i thought that having them in less than 100 milliliter containers would suffice .
i was given bags at cologne airport , so assumed that bags would be given to passengers if necessary . not so .
all bottles must be bagged - in a specific type of sealable bag .
this requirement is intended " to reduce the possibility of spillage , " according to the eu . however , it does not matter if the containers are inspected and scrutinized , shaken and stirred - they are not allowed on the plane , unless they are bagged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying has become a stressful experience with the new liquid rules " you can not take these , it is the rules , " the security woman told me without any further explanation . at the prospect of losing my perfume - my liquid luxury - i pled with the security officer to let me keep it .
after some convincing she gave in . " you can take the perfume , but not these ones - now get out of here before someone sees you , " the officer said , before leaving me to run for the plane . my deodorant and toothpaste were discarded as insignificant casualties , but i was left confused .
why were they were more dangerous than the perfume ? delays and hassles my fellow traveler was subjected to worse scrutiny and inspection .
after being questioned for nearly 25 minutes while having her bag taken apart , she was finally allowed through .
this was mainly because the inspection was holding up the plane and the flight attendant asked the security inspectors to let her go - my associate also had to leave a number of bottles behind . after landing in cologne , we realized that there were cosmetics , body wash , and toothpaste in her bag that had gone totally unnoticed . next time , i think i 'll take the train . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making sense of new eu airport security regulations the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .

1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .

meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .

there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .

his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot . " destabilization of lebanon on no-one 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-siniora media have called the protests a coup attempt the destabilization of lebanon was in not in the interest of anyone inside or outside lebanon , he said .
" for this reason the european union and especially germany is exerting all its efforts to help lebanon and to secure a ceasefire on the border " with israel . german naval troops continued to monitor lebanon 's coast and the german government had offered equipment and training to border personnel as well as 80 million euros in aid , he added . upon his arrival at the airport , steinmeier handed over scanners to customs officers for searching goods coming into the country .
germany has also supplied lebanon with shipping vehicles and computers for use in border monitoring . the german naval contingent is part of a un force entrusted with monitoring the coast to prevent any arms shipment to hezbollah in line with un security council resolution 1701 that ended a month-long war between israel and hezbollah this summer . in beirut , steinmeier also held what he described as " very positive talks " with the pro-syrian parliament speaker nabih berri , who is a close ally of hezbollah . west critcizes attempts to unseat siniora 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors remain on the streets of beirut meanwhile , lebanon 's western-backed cabinet vowed not to cave in to calls to resign as the political deadlock which has nearly paralyzed state institutions amid a fierce struggle for supremacy between pro- and anti-syrian camps within the power-sharing regime tightened . the stand-off has prompted concern and criticism from western nations eager for lebanon to remain under the control of the siniora government . us state department spokesman tom casey said washington denounced what he called " threats of intimidation or violence " which " are aimed at toppling lebanon 's legitimate and democratically elected government " . british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who also held talks with siniora saturday , expressed her support for his government .
" we call on all parties to work together for the good of lebanon , and to return to dialogue , " she said . arab league chief amr mussa was to hold talks in beirut on sunday to offer his services as a mediator , arab diplomats said .
the saudi ambassador mediated between the two sides late friday and brokered the reopening of some access roads to siniora 's offices . lebanese deadlock attributed to hariri tribunal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafik hariri 's murder is a scar that wo n't heal siniora appealed saturday for renewed talks with the opposition over a deadlock which threatens to block the government 's legislative program , including its centerpiece plans for an international tribunal to try the suspects in the murder of his predecessor rafiq hariri 's murder , in which syria has been implicated . the opposition spearheaded by hezbollah is demanding a greater say in the government , which it charges has been riding roughshod over the power-sharing arrangements in force since lebanon 's devastating 1975-90 civil war . but the anti-damascus camp says the opposition demands are a ploy at the behest of their syrian sponsors to avoid the formation of the proposed international tribunal to try suspects in the hariri murder . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon protests threaten to derail steinmeier 's mid-east tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meets palestinian president abbas saturday .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot . " destabilization of lebanon on no-one 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-siniora media have called the protests a coup attempt the destabilization of lebanon was in not in the interest of anyone inside or outside lebanon , he said .
" for this reason the european union and especially germany is exerting all its efforts to help lebanon and to secure a ceasefire on the border " with israel . german naval troops continued to monitor lebanon 's coast and the german government had offered equipment and training to border personnel as well as 80 million euros in aid , he added . upon his arrival at the airport , steinmeier handed over scanners to customs officers for searching goods coming into the country .
germany has also supplied lebanon with shipping vehicles and computers for use in border monitoring . the german naval contingent is part of a un force entrusted with monitoring the coast to prevent any arms shipment to hezbollah in line with un security council resolution 1701 that ended a month-long war between israel and hezbollah this summer . in beirut , steinmeier also held what he described as " very positive talks " with the pro-syrian parliament speaker nabih berri , who is a close ally of hezbollah . west critcizes attempts to unseat siniora 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors remain on the streets of beirut meanwhile , lebanon 's western-backed cabinet vowed not to cave in to calls to resign as the political deadlock which has nearly paralyzed state institutions amid a fierce struggle for supremacy between pro- and anti-syrian camps within the power-sharing regime tightened . the stand-off has prompted concern and criticism from western nations eager for lebanon to remain under the control of the siniora government . us state department spokesman tom casey said washington denounced what he called " threats of intimidation or violence " which " are aimed at toppling lebanon 's legitimate and democratically elected government " . british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who also held talks with siniora saturday , expressed her support for his government .
" we call on all parties to work together for the good of lebanon , and to return to dialogue , " she said . arab league chief amr mussa was to hold talks in beirut on sunday to offer his services as a mediator , arab diplomats said .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .
he has not catalogued them in any particular way , so kitsch and tacky angels stand side-by-side with more artistic ones or sacred pieces , a plump cheeky cherub might be randomly placed next to an angry knight brandishing a sword .
there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .
since then , visitor numbers have soared .
unfortunately , fischer can not keep up .
his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .
" the pleasure people get is indescribable - not only at christmas but the whole year round .
that 's why i want to make sure the angels are in good hands before i die . " dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's next moma ?

" it is time for a wage policy that grants employees appropriate pay increases , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper . " out of fairness but also in the interest of the economy , we need wage agreements that are appropriate to the economic situation , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck has the support of the unions beck said that in recent years sector wage agreements had been " very moderate " due to anemic economic growth but that it was now sensible to boost workers ' buying power . the spd serves in a left-right ' grand coalition ' with chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian union bloc . the powerful electrical , engineering and metalworking sector union ig metall agreed to a three-percent wage increase in april covering the period from june to march 2007 .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .
he has not catalogued them in any particular way , so kitsch and tacky angels stand side-by-side with more artistic ones or sacred pieces , a plump cheeky cherub might be randomly placed next to an angry knight brandishing a sword .
there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .
since then , visitor numbers have soared .
unfortunately , fischer can not keep up .
his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

" a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .

in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country .

his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

" it is time for a wage policy that grants employees appropriate pay increases , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper . " out of fairness but also in the interest of the economy , we need wage agreements that are appropriate to the economic situation , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck has the support of the unions beck said that in recent years sector wage agreements had been " very moderate " due to anemic economic growth but that it was now sensible to boost workers ' buying power . the spd serves in a left-right ' grand coalition ' with chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian union bloc . the powerful electrical , engineering and metalworking sector union ig metall agreed to a three-percent wage increase in april covering the period from june to march 2007 .
the next round of negotiations is set for early 2007 . union chiefs back call for larger slice of the cake the head of the industry employers ' association gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser , said he agreed the sector 's 3.4 million workers deserved " an appropriate share of the growth and success " it had seen in recent months . he told sunday 's neue osnabrücker zeitung that the german sector had begun to tap into the industry 's global boom and that was time to reward workers .
but he warned against " exaggerated " wage hikes that he said could nip the upturn in the bud by making german products on the world market too expensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall chief jürgen peters expects increases by 2007 for its part , ig metall said it expected a clear increase in pay in 2007 .
" the economic situation in 2007 will be significantly better than in this year .
the upcoming wage outcome must reflect that , " the ig metall chief in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , detlef wetzel , told the bild am sonntag . union officials said that demands for a pay raise next year ranged from five to eight percent . growth forecasts underestimate german potential the government is officially forecasting growth of 2.3 percent this year , followed by 1.4 percent in 2007 and 1.75 percent in both 2008 and 2009 - rates considered conservative by independent observers . with business confidence at a 15-year high and consumer confidence stronger than it has been for five years , the bundesbank , the organization for economic cooperation and development and the international monetary fund have upgraded their growth forecasts for germany this year and next year . the optimism comes despite plans to raise the valued added tax by full three percentage points to 19 percent with effect from january 1 , the biggest-ever increase in sales tax in germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leaders under fire as unions revolt the leader of germany 's powerful trade union federation insisted thursday that it would not back down in its demands for a national minimum wage , defying chancellor angela merkel .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot . " destabilization of lebanon on no-one 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-siniora media have called the protests a coup attempt the destabilization of lebanon was in not in the interest of anyone inside or outside lebanon , he said .
" for this reason the european union and especially germany is exerting all its efforts to help lebanon and to secure a ceasefire on the border " with israel . german naval troops continued to monitor lebanon 's coast and the german government had offered equipment and training to border personnel as well as 80 million euros in aid , he added . upon his arrival at the airport , steinmeier handed over scanners to customs officers for searching goods coming into the country .
germany has also supplied lebanon with shipping vehicles and computers for use in border monitoring . the german naval contingent is part of a un force entrusted with monitoring the coast to prevent any arms shipment to hezbollah in line with un security council resolution 1701 that ended a month-long war between israel and hezbollah this summer . in beirut , steinmeier also held what he described as " very positive talks " with the pro-syrian parliament speaker nabih berri , who is a close ally of hezbollah . west critcizes attempts to unseat siniora 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors remain on the streets of beirut meanwhile , lebanon 's western-backed cabinet vowed not to cave in to calls to resign as the political deadlock which has nearly paralyzed state institutions amid a fierce struggle for supremacy between pro- and anti-syrian camps within the power-sharing regime tightened . the stand-off has prompted concern and criticism from western nations eager for lebanon to remain under the control of the siniora government . us state department spokesman tom casey said washington denounced what he called " threats of intimidation or violence " which " are aimed at toppling lebanon 's legitimate and democratically elected government " . british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who also held talks with siniora saturday , expressed her support for his government .
" we call on all parties to work together for the good of lebanon , and to return to dialogue , " she said . arab league chief amr mussa was to hold talks in beirut on sunday to offer his services as a mediator , arab diplomats said .
the saudi ambassador mediated between the two sides late friday and brokered the reopening of some access roads to siniora 's offices . lebanese deadlock attributed to hariri tribunal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafik hariri 's murder is a scar that wo n't heal siniora appealed saturday for renewed talks with the opposition over a deadlock which threatens to block the government 's legislative program , including its centerpiece plans for an international tribunal to try the suspects in the murder of his predecessor rafiq hariri 's murder , in which syria has been implicated . the opposition spearheaded by hezbollah is demanding a greater say in the government , which it charges has been riding roughshod over the power-sharing arrangements in force since lebanon 's devastating 1975-90 civil war . but the anti-damascus camp says the opposition demands are a ploy at the behest of their syrian sponsors to avoid the formation of the proposed international tribunal to try suspects in the hariri murder . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon protests threaten to derail steinmeier 's mid-east tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meets palestinian president abbas saturday .

" it is time for a wage policy that grants employees appropriate pay increases , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper . " out of fairness but also in the interest of the economy , we need wage agreements that are appropriate to the economic situation , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck has the support of the unions beck said that in recent years sector wage agreements had been " very moderate " due to anemic economic growth but that it was now sensible to boost workers ' buying power . the spd serves in a left-right ' grand coalition ' with chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian union bloc . the powerful electrical , engineering and metalworking sector union ig metall agreed to a three-percent wage increase in april covering the period from june to march 2007 .
the next round of negotiations is set for early 2007 . union chiefs back call for larger slice of the cake the head of the industry employers ' association gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser , said he agreed the sector 's 3.4 million workers deserved " an appropriate share of the growth and success " it had seen in recent months . he told sunday 's neue osnabrücker zeitung that the german sector had begun to tap into the industry 's global boom and that was time to reward workers .
but he warned against " exaggerated " wage hikes that he said could nip the upturn in the bud by making german products on the world market too expensive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall chief jürgen peters expects increases by 2007 for its part , ig metall said it expected a clear increase in pay in 2007 .
" the economic situation in 2007 will be significantly better than in this year .
the upcoming wage outcome must reflect that , " the ig metall chief in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , detlef wetzel , told the bild am sonntag . union officials said that demands for a pay raise next year ranged from five to eight percent . growth forecasts underestimate german potential the government is officially forecasting growth of 2.3 percent this year , followed by 1.4 percent in 2007 and 1.75 percent in both 2008 and 2009 - rates considered conservative by independent observers . with business confidence at a 15-year high and consumer confidence stronger than it has been for five years , the bundesbank , the organization for economic cooperation and development and the international monetary fund have upgraded their growth forecasts for germany this year and next year . the optimism comes despite plans to raise the valued added tax by full three percentage points to 19 percent with effect from january 1 , the biggest-ever increase in sales tax in germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leaders under fire as unions revolt the leader of germany 's powerful trade union federation insisted thursday that it would not back down in its demands for a national minimum wage , defying chancellor angela merkel .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .
he has not catalogued them in any particular way , so kitsch and tacky angels stand side-by-side with more artistic ones or sacred pieces , a plump cheeky cherub might be randomly placed next to an angry knight brandishing a sword .
there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .
since then , visitor numbers have soared .

his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .

there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .

one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

airport officials had announced that passengers should be prepared for changes aimed at preventing liquid explosives from being the next weapon of choice for terrorists .
carry-on liquids now have to be kept in 100-milliliter containers in sealed plastic bags and each person can not bring along more than one liter in total . but the full effect was n't apparent until going through airport security myself . excessive plastic and waste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do the discarded bottles end up as landfill ? at cologne airport on a flight to paris , i was given a sealable bag at the service desk for the deodorant , toothpaste and perfume i was carrying .
my bag came from a massive box holding thousands of sealable bags for travelers who did n't come prepared . long lines of anxious , friday morning travelers were waiting at the security checkpoint to have their bags searched and scanned - and their bodies patted down . i was told to throw away my drink bottle .
it was only 6:30 a.m. and the bin where my bottle was discarded was already full of containers , many unopened .
i wondered what would happen to the tons of unnecessary waste . although i was not bothered by the security hold-ups and having to remove my boots and belt , the worst part was getting frisked rather aggressively and invasively with a large audience of passengers behind me . cologne to paris was bothersome considering the wait and the public groping .
but it was definitely carefree compared to the return journey from charles de gaulle airport . paris airport disaster my toothpaste , deodorant and perfume were not in a sealable bag when i passed through security checks in paris .
i thought that having them in less than 100 milliliter containers would suffice .
i was given bags at cologne airport , so assumed that bags would be given to passengers if necessary . not so .
all bottles must be bagged - in a specific type of sealable bag .
this requirement is intended " to reduce the possibility of spillage , " according to the eu . however , it does not matter if the containers are inspected and scrutinized , shaken and stirred - they are not allowed on the plane , unless they are bagged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying has become a stressful experience with the new liquid rules " you can not take these , it is the rules , " the security woman told me without any further explanation . at the prospect of losing my perfume - my liquid luxury - i pled with the security officer to let me keep it .
after some convincing she gave in . " you can take the perfume , but not these ones - now get out of here before someone sees you , " the officer said , before leaving me to run for the plane . my deodorant and toothpaste were discarded as insignificant casualties , but i was left confused .
why were they were more dangerous than the perfume ? delays and hassles my fellow traveler was subjected to worse scrutiny and inspection .
after being questioned for nearly 25 minutes while having her bag taken apart , she was finally allowed through .
this was mainly because the inspection was holding up the plane and the flight attendant asked the security inspectors to let her go - my associate also had to leave a number of bottles behind . after landing in cologne , we realized that there were cosmetics , body wash , and toothpaste in her bag that had gone totally unnoticed . next time , i think i 'll take the train . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making sense of new eu airport security regulations the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .
he has not catalogued them in any particular way , so kitsch and tacky angels stand side-by-side with more artistic ones or sacred pieces , a plump cheeky cherub might be randomly placed next to an angry knight brandishing a sword .
there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .

unfortunately , fischer can not keep up .
his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .

" during a stop in beirut saturday , steinmeier urged foreign powers to stay out of lebanese affairs amid a mass protest led by hezbollah aimed at bringing down the western-backed government . on sunday , steinmeier visited german troops leading the naval contingent of a un force deployed to prevent arms trafficking to lebanon following the july-august war between hezbollah and israel . he was to travel to israel later sunday to meet his counterpart tzipi livni and prime minister ehud olmert . washington and paris have refused all contact with the syrian leadership and have regularly accused damascus of attempting to destabilize lebanon . syria came under renewed suspicion after the assassination last month of lebanon 's anti-syrian industry minister , pierre gemayel , in beirut . steinmeir reiterates german support for siniora bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier offered support to beleaguered siniora steinmeier arrived in lebanon saturday for talks with prime minister fuad siniora despite continued tensions over the hezbollah-led sit-in by pro-syria demonstrators outside the government buildings in central beirut where he met the lebanese leader . steinmeier said that germany would continue to support lebanon 's independence in the face of pressure from inside and outside the country , a reference to the protests which started friday and which have brought central beirut to a virtual standstill . " i know your country is passing through a rough situation , " steinmeier told reporters at beirut international airport .
" my presence is a gesture of support for lebanon 's independence in the management of its affairs without foreign intervention . " after his talks with siniora , steinmeier called on all lebanese politicians to work together in the best interest of the country and to ease the burden on the lebanese people " who have been through a lot . " destabilization of lebanon on no-one 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-siniora media have called the protests a coup attempt the destabilization of lebanon was in not in the interest of anyone inside or outside lebanon , he said .
" for this reason the european union and especially germany is exerting all its efforts to help lebanon and to secure a ceasefire on the border " with israel . german naval troops continued to monitor lebanon 's coast and the german government had offered equipment and training to border personnel as well as 80 million euros in aid , he added . upon his arrival at the airport , steinmeier handed over scanners to customs officers for searching goods coming into the country .
germany has also supplied lebanon with shipping vehicles and computers for use in border monitoring . the german naval contingent is part of a un force entrusted with monitoring the coast to prevent any arms shipment to hezbollah in line with un security council resolution 1701 that ended a month-long war between israel and hezbollah this summer . in beirut , steinmeier also held what he described as " very positive talks " with the pro-syrian parliament speaker nabih berri , who is a close ally of hezbollah . west critcizes attempts to unseat siniora 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors remain on the streets of beirut meanwhile , lebanon 's western-backed cabinet vowed not to cave in to calls to resign as the political deadlock which has nearly paralyzed state institutions amid a fierce struggle for supremacy between pro- and anti-syrian camps within the power-sharing regime tightened . the stand-off has prompted concern and criticism from western nations eager for lebanon to remain under the control of the siniora government . us state department spokesman tom casey said washington denounced what he called " threats of intimidation or violence " which " are aimed at toppling lebanon 's legitimate and democratically elected government " . british foreign secretary margaret beckett , who also held talks with siniora saturday , expressed her support for his government .
" we call on all parties to work together for the good of lebanon , and to return to dialogue , " she said . arab league chief amr mussa was to hold talks in beirut on sunday to offer his services as a mediator , arab diplomats said .
the saudi ambassador mediated between the two sides late friday and brokered the reopening of some access roads to siniora 's offices . lebanese deadlock attributed to hariri tribunal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafik hariri 's murder is a scar that wo n't heal siniora appealed saturday for renewed talks with the opposition over a deadlock which threatens to block the government 's legislative program , including its centerpiece plans for an international tribunal to try the suspects in the murder of his predecessor rafiq hariri 's murder , in which syria has been implicated . the opposition spearheaded by hezbollah is demanding a greater say in the government , which it charges has been riding roughshod over the power-sharing arrangements in force since lebanon 's devastating 1975-90 civil war . but the anti-damascus camp says the opposition demands are a ploy at the behest of their syrian sponsors to avoid the formation of the proposed international tribunal to try suspects in the hariri murder . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon protests threaten to derail steinmeier 's mid-east tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meets palestinian president abbas saturday .

" it is time for a wage policy that grants employees appropriate pay increases , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper . " out of fairness but also in the interest of the economy , we need wage agreements that are appropriate to the economic situation , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck has the support of the unions beck said that in recent years sector wage agreements had been " very moderate " due to anemic economic growth but that it was now sensible to boost workers ' buying power . the spd serves in a left-right ' grand coalition ' with chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian union bloc . the powerful electrical , engineering and metalworking sector union ig metall agreed to a three-percent wage increase in april covering the period from june to march 2007 .
the next round of negotiations is set for early 2007 . union chiefs back call for larger slice of the cake the head of the industry employers ' association gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser , said he agreed the sector 's 3.4 million workers deserved " an appropriate share of the growth and success " it had seen in recent months . he told sunday 's neue osnabrücker zeitung that the german sector had begun to tap into the industry 's global boom and that was time to reward workers .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .
he has not catalogued them in any particular way , so kitsch and tacky angels stand side-by-side with more artistic ones or sacred pieces , a plump cheeky cherub might be randomly placed next to an angry knight brandishing a sword .
there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .
since then , visitor numbers have soared .
unfortunately , fischer can not keep up .
his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .
" the pleasure people get is indescribable - not only at christmas but the whole year round .
that 's why i want to make sure the angels are in good hands before i die . " dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's next moma ?

airport officials had announced that passengers should be prepared for changes aimed at preventing liquid explosives from being the next weapon of choice for terrorists .
carry-on liquids now have to be kept in 100-milliliter containers in sealed plastic bags and each person can not bring along more than one liter in total . but the full effect was n't apparent until going through airport security myself . excessive plastic and waste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do the discarded bottles end up as landfill ? at cologne airport on a flight to paris , i was given a sealable bag at the service desk for the deodorant , toothpaste and perfume i was carrying .
my bag came from a massive box holding thousands of sealable bags for travelers who did n't come prepared . long lines of anxious , friday morning travelers were waiting at the security checkpoint to have their bags searched and scanned - and their bodies patted down . i was told to throw away my drink bottle .
it was only 6:30 a.m. and the bin where my bottle was discarded was already full of containers , many unopened .
i wondered what would happen to the tons of unnecessary waste . although i was not bothered by the security hold-ups and having to remove my boots and belt , the worst part was getting frisked rather aggressively and invasively with a large audience of passengers behind me . cologne to paris was bothersome considering the wait and the public groping .
but it was definitely carefree compared to the return journey from charles de gaulle airport . paris airport disaster my toothpaste , deodorant and perfume were not in a sealable bag when i passed through security checks in paris .
i thought that having them in less than 100 milliliter containers would suffice .
i was given bags at cologne airport , so assumed that bags would be given to passengers if necessary . not so .
all bottles must be bagged - in a specific type of sealable bag .
this requirement is intended " to reduce the possibility of spillage , " according to the eu . however , it does not matter if the containers are inspected and scrutinized , shaken and stirred - they are not allowed on the plane , unless they are bagged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying has become a stressful experience with the new liquid rules " you can not take these , it is the rules , " the security woman told me without any further explanation . at the prospect of losing my perfume - my liquid luxury - i pled with the security officer to let me keep it .
after some convincing she gave in . " you can take the perfume , but not these ones - now get out of here before someone sees you , " the officer said , before leaving me to run for the plane . my deodorant and toothpaste were discarded as insignificant casualties , but i was left confused .
why were they were more dangerous than the perfume ? delays and hassles my fellow traveler was subjected to worse scrutiny and inspection .
after being questioned for nearly 25 minutes while having her bag taken apart , she was finally allowed through .
this was mainly because the inspection was holding up the plane and the flight attendant asked the security inspectors to let her go - my associate also had to leave a number of bottles behind . after landing in cologne , we realized that there were cosmetics , body wash , and toothpaste in her bag that had gone totally unnoticed . next time , i think i 'll take the train . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making sense of new eu airport security regulations the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .
" if you compare this generation with the pre-1990s one , the difference is dramatic .
you can see the horizon . " a pivotal role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva has played a pivotal role in bulgaria 's eu accession being able to see the horizon is a welcome change in a country described not long ago by the eu as a hotbed of corruption , contract killers and money laundering .
meglena kuneva has been personally committed to getting a green light from brussels for bulgaria 's eu accession on jan .
1 , 2007 , and flushing out the old guard was a crucial step on this path . " those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .
but when she gets to brussels next year , meglena kuneva will be in charge not of education but consumer protection - a topic at the heart of public debate since bird flu and meat scandals began hitting the headlines . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesrat gives green light to romania , bulgaria eu bids germany 's upper house of parliament friday unanimously ratified the eu entry of romania and bulgaria , paving the way for them to become the bloc 's 26th and 27th member states on jan .

now the country 's designated eu commissioner , she 's slated for the consumer protection portfolio once bulgaria joins the eu on jan .
1 , 2007 . kuneva strongly believes that it 's time bulgarians gained a bit more self-confidence - and is confident they 're on the right path . " i think the desire to be better is there , " the 49-year-old said .
" we are dreaming of a better life and this is a great vehicle for trying to be better and better every single day .
it 's for the benefit of the next generation - i do n't believe that people in the middle of their lives will harvest the fruits . " after four years as minister for european affairs , kuneva is now headed for brussels as her country 's first-ever eu commissioner . an international résumé she studied law and spent time in the us , finland and britain before returning to sofia .
in may 2002 she was appointed bulgaria 's first minister of european affairs in the government of former tsar simeon saxe-coburg - a job she held even after the 2005 parliamentary elections , when her party became a junior partner in the bulgarian socialist party-dominated coalition government of sergey stanishev . but despite the demands of her career , meglena kuneva 's family - her husband and son - comes first .
encouraging the younger generation is one of her top priorities , and she pins her hopes for her country on its younger generation . " they know just as much as students in the rest of europe … they are curious and they have a strong sense of freedom and liberty , " she said .

" those of them who brought the country to this very unfortunate stage in the early 1990s have been outcast from public opinion and never regained the confidence of the public , " she said . in future , meglena kuneva hopes more well-qualified young politicians will be appointed to positions of responsibility .
one potential problem is the ongoing brain drain , with many of the younger generation lured by high salaries and opportunities abroad . " i think we could manage to keep our best people at home if they knew they could come and go , " she said .
" i do n't believe we can keep them with restrictions .
it would n't be fair . " instead , she hopes that eu schemes such as " erasmus " will give young people a chance to spread their wings a little before returning home .

" it is time for a wage policy that grants employees appropriate pay increases , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper . " out of fairness but also in the interest of the economy , we need wage agreements that are appropriate to the economic situation , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck has the support of the unions beck said that in recent years sector wage agreements had been " very moderate " due to anemic economic growth but that it was now sensible to boost workers ' buying power . the spd serves in a left-right ' grand coalition ' with chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian union bloc . the powerful electrical , engineering and metalworking sector union ig metall agreed to a three-percent wage increase in april covering the period from june to march 2007 .

the upcoming wage outcome must reflect that , " the ig metall chief in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , detlef wetzel , told the bild am sonntag . union officials said that demands for a pay raise next year ranged from five to eight percent . growth forecasts underestimate german potential the government is officially forecasting growth of 2.3 percent this year , followed by 1.4 percent in 2007 and 1.75 percent in both 2008 and 2009 - rates considered conservative by independent observers . with business confidence at a 15-year high and consumer confidence stronger than it has been for five years , the bundesbank , the organization for economic cooperation and development and the international monetary fund have upgraded their growth forecasts for germany this year and next year . the optimism comes despite plans to raise the valued added tax by full three percentage points to 19 percent with effect from january 1 , the biggest-ever increase in sales tax in germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leaders under fire as unions revolt the leader of germany 's powerful trade union federation insisted thursday that it would not back down in its demands for a national minimum wage , defying chancellor angela merkel .

angels are as much part of a traditional christmas celebration as a decorated tree , carols , cookies and mulled wine .
but one german collector thinks they do not just have to be remembered during the festive season . for johann fischer , angels are welcome throughout the year , as they represent protection , trust and hope .
he has spent the past 20 years collecting them . the former insurance salesman had a car accident in 1985 which almost cost him his life .
on the night of the accident , he had visited his daughter in hospital .
she had given him a fabric angel for his comfort and safety .
fischer believes the angel saved his life .
today , his " guardian angel " resides in his car , protecting him on his travels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stone angel in a cemetary during his lengthy hospital stay , fischer had time to think about his life .
in his job , he had dealt with safety on earth - now he would ensure it in heaven . he used the compensation money he received to build up his collection , which now boasts over 12,000 angels , combing flea and antique markets up and down the country . " i do n't want to love the angels as individual entities but as a whole mass , " he said .
" that 's what makes collecting them such a pleasure . " angels in every nook and cranny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satirical take on angels fisher 's house and the garage are filled to the brim with angels .
he has not catalogued them in any particular way , so kitsch and tacky angels stand side-by-side with more artistic ones or sacred pieces , a plump cheeky cherub might be randomly placed next to an angry knight brandishing a sword .
there are candles in the form of angels , as well as angel clocks and pocket watches , pieces of jewelry and even rings .
one exhibition room has a showcase with a guardian angel protecting children and soldiers who sings " silent night . " the collection continues to expand as visitors come with their own offerings , and people across the world send fischer items in the post .
the address is not difficult to remember .
by a lucky coincidence , fischer also happens to live in engeldorf , which translates into english as " angel village . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a christmas angel at a department store in downtown düsseldorf four years ago , the angel museum received official recognition when it was entered into the guinness book of records .

his leg was injured in the accident and it is becoming too tiring for him to continue conducting regular guided tours of his fable-like " angeldom . " " i 'm in the process of placing the entire angel collection in good hands because it 's a shame to not let people see it , " he said .

in a tv interview , cmdr frank bainimarama said the army would " find ways " to make prime minister laisenia qarase resign if he refused to do so .
he said he planned to appoint an interim civilian administration and hold elections at a later date .
but cmdr bainimarama did not specify a deadline , amid media reports he plans to act early on monday .
tension has been rising for weeks in the pacific island nation amid a stand-off between cmdr bainimarama , the head of fiji 's military , and the prime minister .
a friday deadline the military leader set for mr qarase to step aside has already passed .
early on thursday , the military staged night-time operations to secure strategic areas of the capital , suva , in what it described as a training exercise .
' sooner the better ' speaking to fiji one television , cmdr bainimarama said mr qarase had to step down .
" our plan is for -lrb- qarase -rrb- to accept the military demand for him to resign , " he said .
if he resists , " we will find ways for him to resign " , he said .
asked when the military planned to act , cmdr bainimarama did not give a specific timing , saying : " what i can say is , the sooner the better . "
local daily the sunday post reported that troops planned to move early on monday morning , citing unnamed sources .
cmdr bainimarama dismissed the report , calling it " rumours " .
but in a fijian-language tv interview , he said that " transition is expected to take place tomorrow as a deadline " , reuters news agency reported .
the feud between the two men goes back several months .
it relates to legislation that mr qarase is seeking to pass , which offers a pardon to people involved in the 2000 racially-motivated coup and allocates the ownership of coastal land to ethnic fijians .
cmdr bainimarama played a key role in putting down the uprising and was at one point forced to flee for his life .
he has made it clear that he does not feel the government has done enough to bring its perpetrators to justice .

it came as some high street chains have started to offer price discounts to try to overcome sluggish sales .
some of the biggest reductions are at clothing stores , according to brc director general kevin hawkins .
" i think this year there is a lot of discounting at the moment - more so than last year , " he said .
" it has been led by the clothing retailers and department stores .
the reason is that the autumn weather was so mild that it leaves them with the problem of getting rid of winter stock . "
costs cut many high street retailers have launched a series of sales and special offers in a bid to lure stay-at-home consumers into early christmas shopping .
the marketing push comes as the latest statistics show that retail sales are down on last year .
christmas trading represents up to 60 % of turnover for some stores , which fear that shoppers are waiting until the last minute in their hunt for bargains .
argos , currys , debenhams and borders are among the chains slashing prices .
other retailers , including house of fraser , homebase , focus , tesco , halfords and superdrug , have introduced savings of up to 50 % .
' incentives ' mr hawkins said online retailers were likely to perform well this christmas .
there has been a rash of discount vouchers being distributed over the internet , as limited schemes are sent far and wide via e-mail . "
the issue is whether or not consumers come out , in what numbers and how near christmas " kevin hawkins , british retail consortium as well as the much publicised threshers voucher other online discount vouchers for stores which are circulating on the internet include ones for selfridges , urban outfitters , oasis , dorothy perkins , gap and warehouse .
latest statistics from research group footfall suggest that the number of shoppers visiting department stores is down 9 % on the same time in 2005 .
and a recent cbi report revealed a " disappointing " november for retailers .
it showed 34 % of retailers reported a decline in sales compared with last year , while 25 % said sales were up .
mr hawkins said : " i think there will be plenty of incentives for consumers to come out and spend money .
" the issue is whether or not they come out , in what numbers and how near christmas .
my guess is it will be very much focused on the last two weeks to 10 days . "
traffic-free on saturday an attempt was made to stimulate shopping in london 's west end by making it entirely traffic free for the first time .
oxford street and regent street were open to pedestrians only from 1030 gmt until 1700 gmt .
organisers said the traffic-free event brought in an estimated one million shoppers , with some shop bosses reporting increased sales .
an estimated 40 million shoppers visit the west end during the six weeks leading up to christmas , a quarter of whom are from overseas .
despite the gloomy forecasts , some shop chains have reported increased sales on the same period last year , including john lewis , up 16 % , boodles , up 30 % , and selfridges , up 11 % .

it came as some high street chains have started to offer price discounts to try to overcome sluggish sales .
some of the biggest reductions are at clothing stores , according to brc director general kevin hawkins .
" i think this year there is a lot of discounting at the moment - more so than last year , " he said .
" it has been led by the clothing retailers and department stores .
the reason is that the autumn weather was so mild that it leaves them with the problem of getting rid of winter stock . "
costs cut many high street retailers have launched a series of sales and special offers in a bid to lure stay-at-home consumers into early christmas shopping .
the marketing push comes as the latest statistics show that retail sales are down on last year .
christmas trading represents up to 60 % of turnover for some stores , which fear that shoppers are waiting until the last minute in their hunt for bargains .
argos , currys , debenhams and borders are among the chains slashing prices .
other retailers , including house of fraser , homebase , focus , tesco , halfords and superdrug , have introduced savings of up to 50 % .
' incentives ' mr hawkins said online retailers were likely to perform well this christmas .
there has been a rash of discount vouchers being distributed over the internet , as limited schemes are sent far and wide via e-mail .
the issue is whether or not consumers come out , in what numbers and how near christmas kevin hawkins , british retail consortium as well as the much publicised threshers voucher other online discount vouchers for stores which are circulating on the internet include ones for selfridges , urban outfitters , oasis , dorothy perkins , gap and warehouse .
latest statistics from research group footfall suggest that the number of shoppers visiting department stores is down 9 % on the same time in 2005 .
and a recent cbi report revealed a " disappointing " november for retailers .
it showed 34 % of retailers reported a decline in sales compared with last year , while 25 % said sales were up .
mr hawkins said : " i think there will be plenty of incentives for consumers to come out and spend money .
" the issue is whether or not they come out , in what numbers and how near christmas .
my guess is it will be very much focused on the last two weeks to 10 days . "

he admitted a " still sceptical " public had yet to be won over to the benefits of road pricing - but said something had to be done to prevent gridlock .
drivers needed first-hand experience of road pricing through pilot schemes in manchester , birmingham and elsewhere within the next five years , he said .
last week a transport study suggested road charges could halve congestion .
the treasury-commissioned study led by former ba chief rod eddington said road pricing could benefit the economy by £ 28bn a year .
' car park ' gridlock asked whether road pricing was inevitable , mr alexander told bbc one 's am programme that it was a " debate that we need to have " and said sir rod 's report was a major contribution to that debate .
he said the number of vehicles on british roads had gone up from 26 million in 1997 to 33 million .
ministers fear that congestion could rise by up to 25 % by 2015 in big towns and cities , if nothing is done .
cps : include file = " / nol / shared / spl / hi / pop _ ups / 06 / uk _ enl _ 1164984240 / inc / one _ launcher.inc " > " unless we 're going to face the alternative of us-style gridlock with some of our busiest roads simply becoming car parks then action is necessary . "
but he ruled out more road-building programmes as a solution , saying : " i think most informed commentators realise we ca n't simply build our way out of the challenge of congestion . "
he said the government was working closely with the regions involved in trial road-pricing schemes and were expecting bids by next summer .
it would mean regional pilots within the next four to five years , and the possibility of a national scheme in about a decade 's time .
but he added that people had to be given more choice about how to get around .
have your say " it 's another way to squeeze money out of us that we can not afford " valerie cooke , hertfordshire send us your comments " i have always believed the only circumstances in which road pricing could be judged a success was if it was partnered with proper investment in public transport , " said mr alexander .
making more room on the railways , for example through longer trains or possibly double-decker trains , might be one way of offering people more choice of transport , he said .
speaking later , shadow chancellor george osbourne said the conservatives were " sympathetic " to road pricing .
he said he could see the m6 toll road had brought " great benefits " to the west midlands .
but he added : " i think road pricing should be linked directly to improvements in transport infrastructure and should not be used as an excuse to increase the overall level of taxation . "

by towing its boeing 747-400 aircraft to take-off areas at london airports during december it said it could save up to two tonnes of fuel per flight .
aircraft will be towed to heathrow and gatwick runways to cut fuel burning .
virgin said a reduction of 120,000 tonnes in carbon emissions a year could be made if extended across its fleet .
' starting grids ' it is hoped to reduce the time engines are running before taking off to about 10 minutes .
" towing aircraft from a stand substantially reduces the amount of time they need to taxi with their engines running and reduces the time spent queuing before take-off , " said virgin atlantic spokesman paul charles .
virgin atlantic is working alongside airport operator baa and national air traffic services -lrb- nats -rrb- during the trial , with a longer run-out expected in the first quarter of 2007 .
aircraft will be towed from their stand at the airport to so-called " starting grids " - which are holding areas , close to a runway , consisting of several parking bays for aircraft .
it means that aircraft can be towed closer to a runway before take-off .
teams from virgin atlantic are also holding talks with the international airports in san francisco and los angeles , as well as jf kennedy airport in new york , about the timing of similar trials .
greenhouse gases virgin atlantic is half owned by sir richard branson and the other half by singapore airlines .
the other aircraft in the fleet are five airbus a340-300 , and 17 airbus a340-600 .
airlines are in the spotlight over the amount of carbon emissions which the industry is producing following falling fares and the growth of low-cost operators ..
aircraft are one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases and environmentalists are calling on the government to take action to reduce their output of carbon .
carbon dioxide emissions from aviation doubled during the 1990s while those from the rest of the economy fell .
currently , aircraft produce about 5.5 % of uk emissions .
in september sir richard said that up to 25 % of the world 's aviation carbon dioxide emissions could be cut if airlines , airports and governments worked together .
he has also pledged virgin group profits worth $ 3bn -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- towards renewable energy initiatives .

" towing aircraft from a stand substantially reduces the amount of time they need to taxi with their engines running and reduces the time spent queuing before take-off , " said virgin atlantic spokesman paul charles .
virgin atlantic is working alongside airport operator baa and national air traffic services -lrb- nats -rrb- during the trial , with a longer run-out expected in the first quarter of 2007 .
aircraft will be towed from their stand at the airport to so-called " starting grids " - which are holding areas , close to a runway , consisting of several parking bays for aircraft .
it means that aircraft can be towed closer to a runway before take-off .
teams from virgin atlantic are also holding talks with the international airports in san francisco and los angeles , as well as jf kennedy airport in new york , about the timing of similar trials .
greenhouse gases virgin atlantic is half owned by sir richard branson and the other half by singapore airlines .
the other aircraft in the fleet are five airbus a340-300 , and 17 airbus a340-600 .
airlines are in the spotlight over the amount of carbon emissions which the industry is producing following falling fares and the growth of low-cost operators ..
aircraft are one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases and environmentalists are calling on the government to take action to reduce their output of carbon .
carbon dioxide emissions from aviation doubled during the 1990s while those from the rest of the economy fell .
currently , aircraft produce about 5.5 % of uk emissions .
in september sir richard said that up to 25 % of the world 's aviation carbon dioxide emissions could be cut if airlines , airports and governments worked together .
he has also pledged virgin group profits worth $ 3bn -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- towards renewable energy initiatives .

' over the moon ' and manilow offered the pair some advice about coping with rejection .
" there are times when i have wanted to hide my head under the duvet , but you have to remember to hold -lsb- it -rsb- high , be confident and have the belief in what you are doing , " he said .
the brothers were gracious in defeat , telling cowell he was " great " although walsh offered another act - eton road - a record deal live on-air last week , he did not do the same for the macdonalds .
