who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .
but those warm relations have now almost become irrelevant . " it 's a paradoxical development .
europeanness has renationalized the left , " said bolaffi .
" the national parties no longer have any relations with each other - it 's all dealt with in brussels . " " curious to meet kurt beck " that 's the domain of the socialist group in the european parliament -lrb- spe -rrb- .
the umbrella organization headquartered in brussels organizes twice-yearly meetings for the top brass of europe 's social democratic parties , said spe spokesman julian scola .
in addition , there are regular ministerial meetings where social democratic opposition spokespersons take part . usually , fundamental questions are discussed .
thus , for instance a meeting of finance ministers would involve growth and investment strategies for europe .
" the parties do influence each other mutually , " said scola .
" a change in leadership in one party is naturally of interest to leaders of other parties too . " scola added that beck 's appointment meant that the spd had an experienced new head . " he 's coming to a meeting of social democrat heads in june .
the other leaders are naturally very curious to meet him .

within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .

" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients . " " existential damage " to care ?
likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .
the vud has asked for mediation in the case , and members are meeting in berlin this week to discuss the topic , association chief jörg-rüdiger siewert told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
the president of the society for german hospitals , rudolf kösters , has called for doctors to stop putting patients in the firing line when it comes to their contract negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .
we ’ re trying to make up for this with rationalization measures and more intelligent solutions concerning the treatment of patients .
we ’ re in the process of working out a scheme which will enable us to survive with fewer , but better-paid doctors .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients .

likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .
the vud has asked for mediation in the case , and members are meeting in berlin this week to discuss the topic , association chief jörg-rüdiger siewert told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .

germany manager jürgen klinsmann sprung two major surprises in his 23-man world cup squad on monday with uncapped midfielder david odonkor and veteran defender jens nowotny included for next month 's finals . borussia dortmund midfielder odonkor has never been called up to the germany squad but finds himself in the final world cup party . klinsmann said he hopes the 22-year-old can add some creativity in midfield after bayern munich star sebastian deisler was ruled out with a knee injury . " odonkor can give us something we are missing , " klinsmann said .
" we need something after -lrb- sebastian -rrb- deisler 's injury .
he is quick , carefree and has a lot to offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he was delighted when i informed him over the phone .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients .

likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .

about 10,000 so-called " un-german " titles went up in flames and disappeared from public life .
most of the authors were persecuted and had to flee the country and some even murdered . in order to remember such barbarism and victimization of authors , the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies in potsdam is launching a " library of burned books . "
and even though the financing for the project has not yet been secured , its promoters are hard-pressed to keep quiet about the project . " the point is to collect a selection of these titles , " said julius schoeps , who runs the center and initiated the project .
" this library should be on a few bookshelves and tour more than 3,000 high schools .
we believe this is a type of living memorial , more important than one made of stone or iron . " books by jews , pacifists , foreigners burned " where one burns books , one burns humanity , " wrote heinrich heine , long before his books were burned by the nazis .
shortly after that , philosopher and political writer theodor lessing was shot in exile and pacifist and nobel prize winner carl von ossietzky died in a concentration camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine 's books were burned by the nazis works by sigmund freud , heinrich heine , bertolt brecht , kurt tucholsky , thomas mann , stefan zweig and anna seghers landed on the pyre .
more than a third of the authors were jewish but in only one out of 10 cases was that listed as a reason for their books being banned .
about 20 percent of the authors were foreigners whose works were popular in german translation , such as jack london or ernest hemingway . " either the authors were jewish or the author 's books were pacifist and against the war , or they were concerned with sexuality or new educational methods , " said schoeps .
" the nazis hated all of those things . " emphasizing achievements students in nazi uniforms celebrated the book burnings while their professors stood nearby , an element the new project aims to explore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmund freud 's work was also targeted it 's also why the mendelssohn center wants the library to grace many german schools with its presence .
as a result , the foundation hopes that each " library " will be made up of 316 volumes at a cost of about 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,200 -rrb- .
the entire project is estimated to cost around 5 million euros .
the financing is now being considered and schoeps is optimistic . the new library will also strongly emphasize the achievements of modern germany .
the exiled academics will thus at least symbolically return to germany , the country that persecuted them and forced them to flee . igal avidan -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de creators praise popularity of berlin holocaust monument as the holocaust memorial in berlin nears its first anniversary , initiators looked back at a year of controversy - and success .

the 29-year-old midfielder 's arrival had been confirmed by chelsea boss jose mourinho on sunday . " he believes in us , he believes in chelsea , he believes we can have success , " mourinho said .
" he chose chelsea and we are very happy , and i think also english football should be happy to have such a player playing in the premiership . " ballack is expected to be the first of three big signings by chelsea this summer .
the germany captain is expected to be followed by ac milan 's ukrainian striker andriy shevchenko .
inter milan 's adriano and corinthians star carlos tevez have also been heavily linked with moves to chelsea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will still head the german national team ballack will reportedly become the highest-paid player in the premiership on a deal said to be worth 130,000 pounds -lrb- 190,700 euros , $ 245,700 -rrb- per week .
but ballack insists that the need for a new challenge rather than financial gain was the deciding factor behind the move . dreami n g of champio n s league title london will be ballack 's first foray outside his native germany , something he announced he wished to experience .
born in the former east germany , he began his professional career at division two side chemnitz .
he then went on to play for kaiserslautern and bayer leverkusen before moving to bayern munich for 12.9 million euros in 2002 after turninng down real madrid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping his eyes on the ball the hope was to add to the 1998 german championship he won with kaiserslautern and capture the champions league crown after going to close with bayer leverkusen in 2002 - when they lost 2-1 to real madrid in the final . domestic titles were forthcoming , with three league and cup doubles in four seasons -lrb- 2003 , 2005 , 2006 -rrb- but the champions league proved out of reach and ballack feels he has a better chance of winning europe 's flagship competition in chelsea 's colors . " i did not win anything at leverkusen so to win six titles in four years with bayern shows the move was worthwhile , " ballack said .
" i hope now i can realize my dream of winning the champions league . " chelsea have won successive premiership titles at a canter but have come up short in the champions league - losing to liverpool in the semi-final last year and barcelona in the last 16 this season - and mourinho will hope ballack can provide the final push . leavi n g a sour taste i n mu n ich ballack guarantees goals from midfield and in his final season at bayern he scored 14 league goals to help the club defend the title .
on the international stage ballack has bagged 30 goals in 63 internationals - a record befitting of a striker - since making his debut in april 1999 . bankrolled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , chelsea probably paid more than 25 million euros plus for ballack .
he effectively became a free agent when he turned down a four-year contract at bayern in september , prompting interest from manchester united , inter milan and real madrid . chelsea waited in the wings and opened negotiations in january after other clubs baulked at ballack 's personal demands .
bayern accepted the player was leaving but a sour taste was left in the mouth as ballack did not publicly say he was joining chelsea until television pictures showed him arriving at london on sunday . bildunterschrift : he wo n't be celebrating with bayern any more in his final games for bayern , ballack was jeered by his own fans and labeled a mercenary by the club management .
his loss is a real blow for the 20-time german champions and german soccer who have lost their biggest star ahead of next month 's world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de champions again but bayern plan makeover to remain on top with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance .

but nearly a million divorces - 2.1 per 1,000 inhabitants - were registered in the same period . it appears cypriots , danes and maltese are the most marrying kind in this union of some 450 million people in 25 member states .
the cypriots clocked up 7.2 nuptials per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by denmark with seven and the maltese with six . at the other end of the marriage market come the slovenes with 3.3 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by the belgians with 4.1 and the greeks with 4.2 .
divorce meanwhile the czechs and lithuanians lead the field when it comes to divorce with 3.2 per 1,000 inhabitants each , followed by the estonians and the belgians .
bildunterschrift : almost half of all children in scandinavia and the baltics are born out of wedlock malta , ireland and italy , where the influence of the roman catholic church is particularly strong , have the lowest divorce rates .
in fact , malta has none because divorce is not allowed on the mediterranean island .
in ireland and italy the rate stands at respectively 0.7 and 0.8 divorces per 1,000 inhabitants .
births but the power of religion does not explain all and is reflected only partially in the birth rate .
ireland has the highest birth rate in the eu with 15.2 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by france with 12.7 , and britain , denmark and luxembourg each with 12 . italy and poland - another strong catholic country - meanwhile register a birth rate below the eu average of 10.5 with 9.7 and 9.3 respectively .
the germans are the least prolific europeans when it comes to begetting , with a rate of only 8.6 , closely behind the latvians with 8.8 and the lithuanians with 8.9 .
illegitimacy nearly a third - 31.6 percent - of the 4.8 million babies born in the european union in 2004 were born out of wedlock .
the phenomenon is particularly noticeable up north in scandinavia and the three baltic member states with a ratio of 57.8 percent in estonia , 55.4 percent in sweden , 45.4 percent in denmark and 45.3 percent in latvia .
france also has a relatively high level of 45.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the highest proportion of one-parent families in the eu the lowest levels of children born out of wedlock are to be found in southern europe with only 3.3 percent in cyprus , 4.9 percent in greece and 14.9 percent in italy .
among the eastern european newcomers to the eu , poland has a rate of 17.2 percent .
by contrast , ireland in the west has an eu average rate of 31.4 percent . the cypriots take first prize for family size , with 10 percent of families made up of three or more children , compared to a 4 percent average throughout the 25 membe states . britain has the largest proportion of one-parent families , with 24 percent of households thus designated , followed by belgium with 18 percent , estonia with 17 percent , denmark and germany with 16 percent each , latvia with 15 percent and france with 14 percent . household expenditures household expenditure reveals an almost equally distributed preponderance of expenditure on housing and attendant costs such gas , electricity and water taking up 21 percent of family budgets on average . only the cypriots , lithuanians , maltese and portuguese spend more on food and transport than on housing .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .
he said the new measure also meant that " journalists may not be used as sources " and indicated that high-ranking officials at the bnd could lose their jobs over the affair .
" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .
" then we will confront the issue of what conclusions to draw in terms of personnel , " he said . the new order only covers the bnd 's protection of its own work - the sole area in which the agency is allowed by law to conduct operations on german soil . the bnd may , however , use journalists as contacts in its foreign operations , wilhelm said . he said he could not answer questions about whether the new rules apply to the office for the protection of the constitution - the domestic intelligence agency , or the military counter-intelligence service . bnd allegedly spied on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are believed to have been targeted by the bnd the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press . former bnd chief volker foertsch has also admitted that journalists had sometimes been used as informers . " the aim of the contacts was to prevent publication of prejudicial articles and find out where the journalists were getting their information from inside the bnd , " he was quoted by another newspaper , the berliner zeitung , as saying . however , former bnd president hansjörg geiger has denied that he allowed any spying of journalists during his term between 1996 and 1998 .
" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd . "
he insisted that the chancellery was not informed . stasi-like methods ? the murky affair is a political bombshell in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the post-war period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom .
it has sparked hot debate with politicians across party lines calling for a full investigation . " even intelligence services have to act within their capacity , the limits have evidently been crossed in this affair , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives .
bosbach added that he expected " personnel consequences " at the bnd because even superiors seemed to have known about the incidents . " this is n't just a trifling matter but rather an extraordinarily grave issue , " said ralf stegner of the social democratic party .
" we will have to get to the bottom of it . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp likened the affair to the methods of the stasi , the secret police of former communist east germany and warned that it could in particular lead to a deep disenchantment in the country 's east . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german agents spied on journalists german intelligence officials kept tabs on the professional and private lives of journalists in a widening scandal as the agency celebrates its 50th year .

" we are prepared to work on a cooperation package and support iran 's development of a proliferation-proof civilian nuclear program , " she said , according to ap news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while reaching out to iran , plassnik said the eu will look to other measures if rejected plassnik added that eu officials were also considering economic assistance , political cooperation as ways to encourage tehran to drop ambitions for a nuclear program that could be used to produce atomic weapons .
the west fears that iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon behind the screen of a civilian atomic energy program .
tehran says it only wants to generate energy . " the intention is not to push iran into further isolation but to find a way to bring iran back to a negotiating track , " plassnik said .
" but we will also look at measures to be taken should iran continue to reject this course . " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , however , told the ambassadors of britain , france and germany monday that any halt to uranium enrichment was " unacceptable , " the official irna news agency reported . " any call for a suspension or pause -lrb- in uranium enrichment -rrb- is illogical and unacceptable and will without any doubt be rejected , " the ministry quoted mottaki as saying .
" tehran is ready to negotiate and would welcome any constructive proposal which both guarantees iran 's legitimate rights and helps settle the nuclear issue . " a " bold offer " ? the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana meanwhile said the bloc could offer the islamic republic " the most sophisticated " technology to help its power needs . " we want to prove to the iranians that we have nothing against iran to use nuclear power for peaceful means , " he told reporters , adding that the bloc would present tehran with a " bold offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear plant in iran " if they want to construct nuclear energy power plants they will have , in cooperation with the european union and other members of the international community , the best and most sophisticated technology , " solana said .
" if they reject that it will mean that what they want is something different . " the eu , whose package must also satisfy russia and china , has until may 19 - when negotiators from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany meet in london - to complete its work . last cha n ces ? solana played down comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , rejecting any new eu offer that might demand that the islamic republic halt uranium enrichment activities .
he added that the iranians had yet to see the bloc 's offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has hardened his stance as a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran has the right to build a civilian nuclear program , but it must submit to inspections by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un watchdog body .
it has refused to fully cooperate with the agency and ahmadinejad has pledged to forge ahead as international pressure to give up enrichment has increased . " this is one of the last chances to resolve this conflict from a diplomatic point of view , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters .
" we are ready to cooperate in the civilian nuclear domain and in trade and political areas .
i think the iranians are going to understand that the europeans are courageous and are proposing something very important . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran insists european offer must recognize enrichment right iran on saturday warned that new european incentives to find a deal over its atomic program would only be of interest if the offer recognized the country 's right to uranium enrichment .

about 10,000 so-called " un-german " titles went up in flames and disappeared from public life .
most of the authors were persecuted and had to flee the country and some even murdered . in order to remember such barbarism and victimization of authors , the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies in potsdam is launching a " library of burned books . "
and even though the financing for the project has not yet been secured , its promoters are hard-pressed to keep quiet about the project . " the point is to collect a selection of these titles , " said julius schoeps , who runs the center and initiated the project .
" this library should be on a few bookshelves and tour more than 3,000 high schools .
we believe this is a type of living memorial , more important than one made of stone or iron . " books by jews , pacifists , foreigners burned " where one burns books , one burns humanity , " wrote heinrich heine , long before his books were burned by the nazis .
shortly after that , philosopher and political writer theodor lessing was shot in exile and pacifist and nobel prize winner carl von ossietzky died in a concentration camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine 's books were burned by the nazis works by sigmund freud , heinrich heine , bertolt brecht , kurt tucholsky , thomas mann , stefan zweig and anna seghers landed on the pyre .
more than a third of the authors were jewish but in only one out of 10 cases was that listed as a reason for their books being banned .
about 20 percent of the authors were foreigners whose works were popular in german translation , such as jack london or ernest hemingway . " either the authors were jewish or the author 's books were pacifist and against the war , or they were concerned with sexuality or new educational methods , " said schoeps .
" the nazis hated all of those things . " emphasizing achievements students in nazi uniforms celebrated the book burnings while their professors stood nearby , an element the new project aims to explore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmund freud 's work was also targeted it 's also why the mendelssohn center wants the library to grace many german schools with its presence .
as a result , the foundation hopes that each " library " will be made up of 316 volumes at a cost of about 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,200 -rrb- .
the entire project is estimated to cost around 5 million euros .
the financing is now being considered and schoeps is optimistic . the new library will also strongly emphasize the achievements of modern germany .

about 10,000 so-called " un-german " titles went up in flames and disappeared from public life .
most of the authors were persecuted and had to flee the country and some even murdered . in order to remember such barbarism and victimization of authors , the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies in potsdam is launching a " library of burned books . "
and even though the financing for the project has not yet been secured , its promoters are hard-pressed to keep quiet about the project . " the point is to collect a selection of these titles , " said julius schoeps , who runs the center and initiated the project .
" this library should be on a few bookshelves and tour more than 3,000 high schools .
we believe this is a type of living memorial , more important than one made of stone or iron . " books by jews , pacifists , foreigners burned " where one burns books , one burns humanity , " wrote heinrich heine , long before his books were burned by the nazis .
shortly after that , philosopher and political writer theodor lessing was shot in exile and pacifist and nobel prize winner carl von ossietzky died in a concentration camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine 's books were burned by the nazis works by sigmund freud , heinrich heine , bertolt brecht , kurt tucholsky , thomas mann , stefan zweig and anna seghers landed on the pyre .
more than a third of the authors were jewish but in only one out of 10 cases was that listed as a reason for their books being banned .
about 20 percent of the authors were foreigners whose works were popular in german translation , such as jack london or ernest hemingway . " either the authors were jewish or the author 's books were pacifist and against the war , or they were concerned with sexuality or new educational methods , " said schoeps .
" the nazis hated all of those things . " emphasizing achievements students in nazi uniforms celebrated the book burnings while their professors stood nearby , an element the new project aims to explore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmund freud 's work was also targeted it 's also why the mendelssohn center wants the library to grace many german schools with its presence .
as a result , the foundation hopes that each " library " will be made up of 316 volumes at a cost of about 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,200 -rrb- .
the entire project is estimated to cost around 5 million euros .
the financing is now being considered and schoeps is optimistic . the new library will also strongly emphasize the achievements of modern germany .
the exiled academics will thus at least symbolically return to germany , the country that persecuted them and forced them to flee . igal avidan -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de creators praise popularity of berlin holocaust monument as the holocaust memorial in berlin nears its first anniversary , initiators looked back at a year of controversy - and success .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .
but those warm relations have now almost become irrelevant . " it 's a paradoxical development .
europeanness has renationalized the left , " said bolaffi .
" the national parties no longer have any relations with each other - it 's all dealt with in brussels . " " curious to meet kurt beck " that 's the domain of the socialist group in the european parliament -lrb- spe -rrb- .
the umbrella organization headquartered in brussels organizes twice-yearly meetings for the top brass of europe 's social democratic parties , said spe spokesman julian scola .
in addition , there are regular ministerial meetings where social democratic opposition spokespersons take part . usually , fundamental questions are discussed .
thus , for instance a meeting of finance ministers would involve growth and investment strategies for europe .
" the parties do influence each other mutually , " said scola .
" a change in leadership in one party is naturally of interest to leaders of other parties too . " scola added that beck 's appointment meant that the spd had an experienced new head . " he 's coming to a meeting of social democrat heads in june .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe .

but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .

but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .
he said the new measure also meant that " journalists may not be used as sources " and indicated that high-ranking officials at the bnd could lose their jobs over the affair .
" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .
" then we will confront the issue of what conclusions to draw in terms of personnel , " he said . the new order only covers the bnd 's protection of its own work - the sole area in which the agency is allowed by law to conduct operations on german soil . the bnd may , however , use journalists as contacts in its foreign operations , wilhelm said . he said he could not answer questions about whether the new rules apply to the office for the protection of the constitution - the domestic intelligence agency , or the military counter-intelligence service . bnd allegedly spied on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are believed to have been targeted by the bnd the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press . former bnd chief volker foertsch has also admitted that journalists had sometimes been used as informers . " the aim of the contacts was to prevent publication of prejudicial articles and find out where the journalists were getting their information from inside the bnd , " he was quoted by another newspaper , the berliner zeitung , as saying . however , former bnd president hansjörg geiger has denied that he allowed any spying of journalists during his term between 1996 and 1998 .
" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd . "
he insisted that the chancellery was not informed . stasi-like methods ? the murky affair is a political bombshell in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the post-war period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom .
it has sparked hot debate with politicians across party lines calling for a full investigation . " even intelligence services have to act within their capacity , the limits have evidently been crossed in this affair , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives .

" we are prepared to work on a cooperation package and support iran 's development of a proliferation-proof civilian nuclear program , " she said , according to ap news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while reaching out to iran , plassnik said the eu will look to other measures if rejected plassnik added that eu officials were also considering economic assistance , political cooperation as ways to encourage tehran to drop ambitions for a nuclear program that could be used to produce atomic weapons .
the west fears that iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon behind the screen of a civilian atomic energy program .
tehran says it only wants to generate energy . " the intention is not to push iran into further isolation but to find a way to bring iran back to a negotiating track , " plassnik said .
" but we will also look at measures to be taken should iran continue to reject this course . " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , however , told the ambassadors of britain , france and germany monday that any halt to uranium enrichment was " unacceptable , " the official irna news agency reported . " any call for a suspension or pause -lrb- in uranium enrichment -rrb- is illogical and unacceptable and will without any doubt be rejected , " the ministry quoted mottaki as saying .
" tehran is ready to negotiate and would welcome any constructive proposal which both guarantees iran 's legitimate rights and helps settle the nuclear issue .

germany manager jürgen klinsmann sprung two major surprises in his 23-man world cup squad on monday with uncapped midfielder david odonkor and veteran defender jens nowotny included for next month 's finals . borussia dortmund midfielder odonkor has never been called up to the germany squad but finds himself in the final world cup party . klinsmann said he hopes the 22-year-old can add some creativity in midfield after bayern munich star sebastian deisler was ruled out with a knee injury . " odonkor can give us something we are missing , " klinsmann said .
" we need something after -lrb- sebastian -rrb- deisler 's injury .
he is quick , carefree and has a lot to offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he was delighted when i informed him over the phone .
i just told him that he does not need to worry .
he has under-21 caps and we are taking half that team with us to the world cup . " bayer leverkusen defender nowotny was the other shock inclusion as he had not played for the national team for two years . nowotny back from injury the 32-year-old nowotny won the last of his 45 caps at euro 2004 but klinsmann hopes he can bring some experience to a youthful defense .
" jens nowotny brings a lot of experience .
he has played in lot of tournaments and knows what it takes , " klinsmann said . " we need different alternatives in central defense as -lrb- christoph -rrb- metzelder is still struggling with injury , " klinsmann added . dortmund defender metzelder is out for two weeks but is also included in the 23-man squad . while there was delight for odonkor and nowotny there was heartache for brazilian-born striker kevin kuranyi who paid the price for a poor season with schalke 04 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year ago kuranyi was first choice in attack but his form dipped and klinsmann only has him on standby with vfl wolfsburg forward mike hanke taking his place . the 22-year-old hanke is suspended for the first two world cup matches against costa rica and poland after receiving a red card in last year 's confederations cup third-place play-off with mexico . " it is a shame that mike is suspended for first two matches but he showed in the last few months that he is really on top of his game , " klinsmann said .
" he has improved and deserves his place . " hosts germany will face costa rica , poland and ecuador in group a at the finals . klinsmann has lined up friendlies against luxembourg on may 27 in freiburg , japan on may 30 in leverkusen and colombia on june 2 in mönchengladbach . germany world cup 2006 squad : goalkeepers : jens lehmann -lrb- arsenal -rrb- , oliver kahn -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , timo hildebrand -lrb- vfb stuttgart -rrb- defenders : arne friedrich -lrb- hertha berlin -rrb- , robert huth -lrb- chelsea -rrb- , marcell jansen -lrb- borussia monchengladbach -rrb- , per mertesacker -lrb- hannover -rrb- , christoph metzelder -lrb- borussia dortmund -rrb- , philipp lahm -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , jens nowotny -lrb- bayer leverkusen -rrb- midfielders : michael ballack -lrb- chelsea -rrb- , bastian schweinsteiger -lrb- bayern munich -rrb- , tim borowski -lrb- werder bremen -rrb- , torsten frings -lrb- werder bremen -rrb- , sebastian kehl -lrb- borussia dortmund -rrb- , bernd schneider -lrb- bayer leverkusen -rrb- , thomas hitzlsperger -lrb- vfb stuttgart -rrb- , david odonkor -lrb- borussia dortmund -rrb- forwards : miroslav klose -lrb- werder bremen -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- fc cologne -rrb- , mike hanke -lrb- vfl wolfsburg -rrb- , oliver neuville -lrb- borussia mönchengladbach -rrb- , gerald asamoah -lrb- schalke 04 -rrb- dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann to stick to youth policy german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann has vowed to continue with his youth policy into the 2006 world cup despite worries about the squad 's still shaky defense , which conceded two goals to south africa wednesday .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .
he said the new measure also meant that " journalists may not be used as sources " and indicated that high-ranking officials at the bnd could lose their jobs over the affair .
" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .
" then we will confront the issue of what conclusions to draw in terms of personnel , " he said . the new order only covers the bnd 's protection of its own work - the sole area in which the agency is allowed by law to conduct operations on german soil . the bnd may , however , use journalists as contacts in its foreign operations , wilhelm said . he said he could not answer questions about whether the new rules apply to the office for the protection of the constitution - the domestic intelligence agency , or the military counter-intelligence service . bnd allegedly spied on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are believed to have been targeted by the bnd the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press . former bnd chief volker foertsch has also admitted that journalists had sometimes been used as informers . " the aim of the contacts was to prevent publication of prejudicial articles and find out where the journalists were getting their information from inside the bnd , " he was quoted by another newspaper , the berliner zeitung , as saying . however , former bnd president hansjörg geiger has denied that he allowed any spying of journalists during his term between 1996 and 1998 .
" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd . "
he insisted that the chancellery was not informed . stasi-like methods ? the murky affair is a political bombshell in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the post-war period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom .
it has sparked hot debate with politicians across party lines calling for a full investigation . " even intelligence services have to act within their capacity , the limits have evidently been crossed in this affair , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives .
bosbach added that he expected " personnel consequences " at the bnd because even superiors seemed to have known about the incidents . " this is n't just a trifling matter but rather an extraordinarily grave issue , " said ralf stegner of the social democratic party .
" we will have to get to the bottom of it . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp likened the affair to the methods of the stasi , the secret police of former communist east germany and warned that it could in particular lead to a deep disenchantment in the country 's east . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german agents spied on journalists german intelligence officials kept tabs on the professional and private lives of journalists in a widening scandal as the agency celebrates its 50th year .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .
he said the new measure also meant that " journalists may not be used as sources " and indicated that high-ranking officials at the bnd could lose their jobs over the affair .
" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .
" then we will confront the issue of what conclusions to draw in terms of personnel , " he said . the new order only covers the bnd 's protection of its own work - the sole area in which the agency is allowed by law to conduct operations on german soil . the bnd may , however , use journalists as contacts in its foreign operations , wilhelm said . he said he could not answer questions about whether the new rules apply to the office for the protection of the constitution - the domestic intelligence agency , or the military counter-intelligence service . bnd allegedly spied on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are believed to have been targeted by the bnd the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press . former bnd chief volker foertsch has also admitted that journalists had sometimes been used as informers .

" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd . "
he insisted that the chancellery was not informed . stasi-like methods ? the murky affair is a political bombshell in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the post-war period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom .
it has sparked hot debate with politicians across party lines calling for a full investigation . " even intelligence services have to act within their capacity , the limits have evidently been crossed in this affair , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .
he said the new measure also meant that " journalists may not be used as sources " and indicated that high-ranking officials at the bnd could lose their jobs over the affair .
" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .
" then we will confront the issue of what conclusions to draw in terms of personnel , " he said . the new order only covers the bnd 's protection of its own work - the sole area in which the agency is allowed by law to conduct operations on german soil . the bnd may , however , use journalists as contacts in its foreign operations , wilhelm said . he said he could not answer questions about whether the new rules apply to the office for the protection of the constitution - the domestic intelligence agency , or the military counter-intelligence service . bnd allegedly spied on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are believed to have been targeted by the bnd the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press . former bnd chief volker foertsch has also admitted that journalists had sometimes been used as informers . " the aim of the contacts was to prevent publication of prejudicial articles and find out where the journalists were getting their information from inside the bnd , " he was quoted by another newspaper , the berliner zeitung , as saying . however , former bnd president hansjörg geiger has denied that he allowed any spying of journalists during his term between 1996 and 1998 .
" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd .

the 29-year-old midfielder 's arrival had been confirmed by chelsea boss jose mourinho on sunday . " he believes in us , he believes in chelsea , he believes we can have success , " mourinho said .
" he chose chelsea and we are very happy , and i think also english football should be happy to have such a player playing in the premiership . " ballack is expected to be the first of three big signings by chelsea this summer .
the germany captain is expected to be followed by ac milan 's ukrainian striker andriy shevchenko .
inter milan 's adriano and corinthians star carlos tevez have also been heavily linked with moves to chelsea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will still head the german national team ballack will reportedly become the highest-paid player in the premiership on a deal said to be worth 130,000 pounds -lrb- 190,700 euros , $ 245,700 -rrb- per week .
but ballack insists that the need for a new challenge rather than financial gain was the deciding factor behind the move . dreami n g of champio n s league title london will be ballack 's first foray outside his native germany , something he announced he wished to experience .
born in the former east germany , he began his professional career at division two side chemnitz .
he then went on to play for kaiserslautern and bayer leverkusen before moving to bayern munich for 12.9 million euros in 2002 after turninng down real madrid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping his eyes on the ball the hope was to add to the 1998 german championship he won with kaiserslautern and capture the champions league crown after going to close with bayer leverkusen in 2002 - when they lost 2-1 to real madrid in the final . domestic titles were forthcoming , with three league and cup doubles in four seasons -lrb- 2003 , 2005 , 2006 -rrb- but the champions league proved out of reach and ballack feels he has a better chance of winning europe 's flagship competition in chelsea 's colors . " i did not win anything at leverkusen so to win six titles in four years with bayern shows the move was worthwhile , " ballack said .
" i hope now i can realize my dream of winning the champions league .

on the international stage ballack has bagged 30 goals in 63 internationals - a record befitting of a striker - since making his debut in april 1999 . bankrolled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , chelsea probably paid more than 25 million euros plus for ballack .
he effectively became a free agent when he turned down a four-year contract at bayern in september , prompting interest from manchester united , inter milan and real madrid . chelsea waited in the wings and opened negotiations in january after other clubs baulked at ballack 's personal demands .

about 10,000 so-called " un-german " titles went up in flames and disappeared from public life .
most of the authors were persecuted and had to flee the country and some even murdered . in order to remember such barbarism and victimization of authors , the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies in potsdam is launching a " library of burned books . "
and even though the financing for the project has not yet been secured , its promoters are hard-pressed to keep quiet about the project . " the point is to collect a selection of these titles , " said julius schoeps , who runs the center and initiated the project .
" this library should be on a few bookshelves and tour more than 3,000 high schools .
we believe this is a type of living memorial , more important than one made of stone or iron . " books by jews , pacifists , foreigners burned " where one burns books , one burns humanity , " wrote heinrich heine , long before his books were burned by the nazis .
shortly after that , philosopher and political writer theodor lessing was shot in exile and pacifist and nobel prize winner carl von ossietzky died in a concentration camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine 's books were burned by the nazis works by sigmund freud , heinrich heine , bertolt brecht , kurt tucholsky , thomas mann , stefan zweig and anna seghers landed on the pyre .
more than a third of the authors were jewish but in only one out of 10 cases was that listed as a reason for their books being banned .
about 20 percent of the authors were foreigners whose works were popular in german translation , such as jack london or ernest hemingway . " either the authors were jewish or the author 's books were pacifist and against the war , or they were concerned with sexuality or new educational methods , " said schoeps .
" the nazis hated all of those things . " emphasizing achievements students in nazi uniforms celebrated the book burnings while their professors stood nearby , an element the new project aims to explore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmund freud 's work was also targeted it 's also why the mendelssohn center wants the library to grace many german schools with its presence .
as a result , the foundation hopes that each " library " will be made up of 316 volumes at a cost of about 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,200 -rrb- .
the entire project is estimated to cost around 5 million euros .
the financing is now being considered and schoeps is optimistic . the new library will also strongly emphasize the achievements of modern germany .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients . " " existential damage " to care ?
likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .
the vud has asked for mediation in the case , and members are meeting in berlin this week to discuss the topic , association chief jörg-rüdiger siewert told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
the president of the society for german hospitals , rudolf kösters , has called for doctors to stop putting patients in the firing line when it comes to their contract negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .
we ’ re trying to make up for this with rationalization measures and more intelligent solutions concerning the treatment of patients .
we ’ re in the process of working out a scheme which will enable us to survive with fewer , but better-paid doctors .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients . " " existential damage " to care ?
likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .
the vud has asked for mediation in the case , and members are meeting in berlin this week to discuss the topic , association chief jörg-rüdiger siewert told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
the president of the society for german hospitals , rudolf kösters , has called for doctors to stop putting patients in the firing line when it comes to their contract negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .
we ’ re trying to make up for this with rationalization measures and more intelligent solutions concerning the treatment of patients .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients . " " existential damage " to care ?
likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .
but those warm relations have now almost become irrelevant . " it 's a paradoxical development .
europeanness has renationalized the left , " said bolaffi .
" the national parties no longer have any relations with each other - it 's all dealt with in brussels . " " curious to meet kurt beck " that 's the domain of the socialist group in the european parliament -lrb- spe -rrb- .
the umbrella organization headquartered in brussels organizes twice-yearly meetings for the top brass of europe 's social democratic parties , said spe spokesman julian scola .
in addition , there are regular ministerial meetings where social democratic opposition spokespersons take part . usually , fundamental questions are discussed .
thus , for instance a meeting of finance ministers would involve growth and investment strategies for europe .
" the parties do influence each other mutually , " said scola .
" a change in leadership in one party is naturally of interest to leaders of other parties too . " scola added that beck 's appointment meant that the spd had an experienced new head . " he 's coming to a meeting of social democrat heads in june .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .

marriage some 2.2 million marriages were registered in 2004 , or 4.8 marriages per 1,000 inhabitants .
but nearly a million divorces - 2.1 per 1,000 inhabitants - were registered in the same period . it appears cypriots , danes and maltese are the most marrying kind in this union of some 450 million people in 25 member states .
the cypriots clocked up 7.2 nuptials per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by denmark with seven and the maltese with six . at the other end of the marriage market come the slovenes with 3.3 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by the belgians with 4.1 and the greeks with 4.2 .
divorce meanwhile the czechs and lithuanians lead the field when it comes to divorce with 3.2 per 1,000 inhabitants each , followed by the estonians and the belgians .

marriage some 2.2 million marriages were registered in 2004 , or 4.8 marriages per 1,000 inhabitants .
but nearly a million divorces - 2.1 per 1,000 inhabitants - were registered in the same period . it appears cypriots , danes and maltese are the most marrying kind in this union of some 450 million people in 25 member states .
the cypriots clocked up 7.2 nuptials per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by denmark with seven and the maltese with six . at the other end of the marriage market come the slovenes with 3.3 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by the belgians with 4.1 and the greeks with 4.2 .
divorce meanwhile the czechs and lithuanians lead the field when it comes to divorce with 3.2 per 1,000 inhabitants each , followed by the estonians and the belgians .
bildunterschrift : almost half of all children in scandinavia and the baltics are born out of wedlock malta , ireland and italy , where the influence of the roman catholic church is particularly strong , have the lowest divorce rates .
in fact , malta has none because divorce is not allowed on the mediterranean island .
in ireland and italy the rate stands at respectively 0.7 and 0.8 divorces per 1,000 inhabitants .
births but the power of religion does not explain all and is reflected only partially in the birth rate .
ireland has the highest birth rate in the eu with 15.2 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by france with 12.7 , and britain , denmark and luxembourg each with 12 . italy and poland - another strong catholic country - meanwhile register a birth rate below the eu average of 10.5 with 9.7 and 9.3 respectively .
the germans are the least prolific europeans when it comes to begetting , with a rate of only 8.6 , closely behind the latvians with 8.8 and the lithuanians with 8.9 .
illegitimacy nearly a third - 31.6 percent - of the 4.8 million babies born in the european union in 2004 were born out of wedlock .
the phenomenon is particularly noticeable up north in scandinavia and the three baltic member states with a ratio of 57.8 percent in estonia , 55.4 percent in sweden , 45.4 percent in denmark and 45.3 percent in latvia .
france also has a relatively high level of 45.2 percent .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.05.2006 university doctors enter week-long strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors mean empty beds in non-urgent facilities doctors at 25 university clinics and 14 state hospitals across germany have expanded ongoing strikes , leading to the largest physician work-stoppage in the country 's history . after the state and doctors ' union failed to reach a deal in last-ditch talks last week , doctors at 25 university and 14 state hospitals said they will lay down their stethoscopes for a full week . the move takes the labor negotiations to a new level , after eight weeks of stop-and-go action strikes .
patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients . " " existential damage " to care ?
likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .
the vud has asked for mediation in the case , and members are meeting in berlin this week to discuss the topic , association chief jörg-rüdiger siewert told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
the president of the society for german hospitals , rudolf kösters , has called for doctors to stop putting patients in the firing line when it comes to their contract negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .
we ’ re trying to make up for this with rationalization measures and more intelligent solutions concerning the treatment of patients .
we ’ re in the process of working out a scheme which will enable us to survive with fewer , but better-paid doctors . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors ' strikes cut into hospital finances doctors ' strikes in germany are in their third week and costing hospitals hundreds of thousands of euros every day .
some hospital administrators said cutting personnel may be their only option .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .
but those warm relations have now almost become irrelevant . " it 's a paradoxical development .
europeanness has renationalized the left , " said bolaffi .
" the national parties no longer have any relations with each other - it 's all dealt with in brussels . " " curious to meet kurt beck " that 's the domain of the socialist group in the european parliament -lrb- spe -rrb- .
the umbrella organization headquartered in brussels organizes twice-yearly meetings for the top brass of europe 's social democratic parties , said spe spokesman julian scola .
in addition , there are regular ministerial meetings where social democratic opposition spokespersons take part . usually , fundamental questions are discussed .
thus , for instance a meeting of finance ministers would involve growth and investment strategies for europe .
" the parties do influence each other mutually , " said scola .
" a change in leadership in one party is naturally of interest to leaders of other parties too . " scola added that beck 's appointment meant that the spd had an experienced new head . " he 's coming to a meeting of social democrat heads in june .
the other leaders are naturally very curious to meet him .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .
he said the new measure also meant that " journalists may not be used as sources " and indicated that high-ranking officials at the bnd could lose their jobs over the affair .
" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .
" then we will confront the issue of what conclusions to draw in terms of personnel , " he said . the new order only covers the bnd 's protection of its own work - the sole area in which the agency is allowed by law to conduct operations on german soil . the bnd may , however , use journalists as contacts in its foreign operations , wilhelm said . he said he could not answer questions about whether the new rules apply to the office for the protection of the constitution - the domestic intelligence agency , or the military counter-intelligence service . bnd allegedly spied on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are believed to have been targeted by the bnd the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press . former bnd chief volker foertsch has also admitted that journalists had sometimes been used as informers . " the aim of the contacts was to prevent publication of prejudicial articles and find out where the journalists were getting their information from inside the bnd , " he was quoted by another newspaper , the berliner zeitung , as saying . however , former bnd president hansjörg geiger has denied that he allowed any spying of journalists during his term between 1996 and 1998 .
" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd .

he insisted that the chancellery was not informed . stasi-like methods ? the murky affair is a political bombshell in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the post-war period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .

marriage some 2.2 million marriages were registered in 2004 , or 4.8 marriages per 1,000 inhabitants .
but nearly a million divorces - 2.1 per 1,000 inhabitants - were registered in the same period . it appears cypriots , danes and maltese are the most marrying kind in this union of some 450 million people in 25 member states .
the cypriots clocked up 7.2 nuptials per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by denmark with seven and the maltese with six . at the other end of the marriage market come the slovenes with 3.3 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by the belgians with 4.1 and the greeks with 4.2 .
divorce meanwhile the czechs and lithuanians lead the field when it comes to divorce with 3.2 per 1,000 inhabitants each , followed by the estonians and the belgians .
bildunterschrift : almost half of all children in scandinavia and the baltics are born out of wedlock malta , ireland and italy , where the influence of the roman catholic church is particularly strong , have the lowest divorce rates .
in fact , malta has none because divorce is not allowed on the mediterranean island .
in ireland and italy the rate stands at respectively 0.7 and 0.8 divorces per 1,000 inhabitants .
births but the power of religion does not explain all and is reflected only partially in the birth rate .
ireland has the highest birth rate in the eu with 15.2 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by france with 12.7 , and britain , denmark and luxembourg each with 12 . italy and poland - another strong catholic country - meanwhile register a birth rate below the eu average of 10.5 with 9.7 and 9.3 respectively .
the germans are the least prolific europeans when it comes to begetting , with a rate of only 8.6 , closely behind the latvians with 8.8 and the lithuanians with 8.9 .
illegitimacy nearly a third - 31.6 percent - of the 4.8 million babies born in the european union in 2004 were born out of wedlock .
the phenomenon is particularly noticeable up north in scandinavia and the three baltic member states with a ratio of 57.8 percent in estonia , 55.4 percent in sweden , 45.4 percent in denmark and 45.3 percent in latvia .
france also has a relatively high level of 45.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the highest proportion of one-parent families in the eu the lowest levels of children born out of wedlock are to be found in southern europe with only 3.3 percent in cyprus , 4.9 percent in greece and 14.9 percent in italy .
among the eastern european newcomers to the eu , poland has a rate of 17.2 percent .
by contrast , ireland in the west has an eu average rate of 31.4 percent . the cypriots take first prize for family size , with 10 percent of families made up of three or more children , compared to a 4 percent average throughout the 25 membe states . britain has the largest proportion of one-parent families , with 24 percent of households thus designated , followed by belgium with 18 percent , estonia with 17 percent , denmark and germany with 16 percent each , latvia with 15 percent and france with 14 percent . household expenditures household expenditure reveals an almost equally distributed preponderance of expenditure on housing and attendant costs such gas , electricity and water taking up 21 percent of family budgets on average . only the cypriots , lithuanians , maltese and portuguese spend more on food and transport than on housing .

" we are prepared to work on a cooperation package and support iran 's development of a proliferation-proof civilian nuclear program , " she said , according to ap news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while reaching out to iran , plassnik said the eu will look to other measures if rejected plassnik added that eu officials were also considering economic assistance , political cooperation as ways to encourage tehran to drop ambitions for a nuclear program that could be used to produce atomic weapons .
the west fears that iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon behind the screen of a civilian atomic energy program .
tehran says it only wants to generate energy . " the intention is not to push iran into further isolation but to find a way to bring iran back to a negotiating track , " plassnik said .
" but we will also look at measures to be taken should iran continue to reject this course . " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , however , told the ambassadors of britain , france and germany monday that any halt to uranium enrichment was " unacceptable , " the official irna news agency reported . " any call for a suspension or pause -lrb- in uranium enrichment -rrb- is illogical and unacceptable and will without any doubt be rejected , " the ministry quoted mottaki as saying .
" tehran is ready to negotiate and would welcome any constructive proposal which both guarantees iran 's legitimate rights and helps settle the nuclear issue . " a " bold offer " ? the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana meanwhile said the bloc could offer the islamic republic " the most sophisticated " technology to help its power needs . " we want to prove to the iranians that we have nothing against iran to use nuclear power for peaceful means , " he told reporters , adding that the bloc would present tehran with a " bold offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear plant in iran " if they want to construct nuclear energy power plants they will have , in cooperation with the european union and other members of the international community , the best and most sophisticated technology , " solana said .
" if they reject that it will mean that what they want is something different . " the eu , whose package must also satisfy russia and china , has until may 19 - when negotiators from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany meet in london - to complete its work . last cha n ces ? solana played down comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , rejecting any new eu offer that might demand that the islamic republic halt uranium enrichment activities .
he added that the iranians had yet to see the bloc 's offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has hardened his stance as a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran has the right to build a civilian nuclear program , but it must submit to inspections by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un watchdog body .
it has refused to fully cooperate with the agency and ahmadinejad has pledged to forge ahead as international pressure to give up enrichment has increased . " this is one of the last chances to resolve this conflict from a diplomatic point of view , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters .
" we are ready to cooperate in the civilian nuclear domain and in trade and political areas .

marriage some 2.2 million marriages were registered in 2004 , or 4.8 marriages per 1,000 inhabitants .
but nearly a million divorces - 2.1 per 1,000 inhabitants - were registered in the same period . it appears cypriots , danes and maltese are the most marrying kind in this union of some 450 million people in 25 member states .
the cypriots clocked up 7.2 nuptials per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by denmark with seven and the maltese with six . at the other end of the marriage market come the slovenes with 3.3 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by the belgians with 4.1 and the greeks with 4.2 .
divorce meanwhile the czechs and lithuanians lead the field when it comes to divorce with 3.2 per 1,000 inhabitants each , followed by the estonians and the belgians .
bildunterschrift : almost half of all children in scandinavia and the baltics are born out of wedlock malta , ireland and italy , where the influence of the roman catholic church is particularly strong , have the lowest divorce rates .
in fact , malta has none because divorce is not allowed on the mediterranean island .

about 10,000 so-called " un-german " titles went up in flames and disappeared from public life .
most of the authors were persecuted and had to flee the country and some even murdered . in order to remember such barbarism and victimization of authors , the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies in potsdam is launching a " library of burned books . "
and even though the financing for the project has not yet been secured , its promoters are hard-pressed to keep quiet about the project . " the point is to collect a selection of these titles , " said julius schoeps , who runs the center and initiated the project .
" this library should be on a few bookshelves and tour more than 3,000 high schools .
we believe this is a type of living memorial , more important than one made of stone or iron . " books by jews , pacifists , foreigners burned " where one burns books , one burns humanity , " wrote heinrich heine , long before his books were burned by the nazis .
shortly after that , philosopher and political writer theodor lessing was shot in exile and pacifist and nobel prize winner carl von ossietzky died in a concentration camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine 's books were burned by the nazis works by sigmund freud , heinrich heine , bertolt brecht , kurt tucholsky , thomas mann , stefan zweig and anna seghers landed on the pyre .
more than a third of the authors were jewish but in only one out of 10 cases was that listed as a reason for their books being banned .
about 20 percent of the authors were foreigners whose works were popular in german translation , such as jack london or ernest hemingway . " either the authors were jewish or the author 's books were pacifist and against the war , or they were concerned with sexuality or new educational methods , " said schoeps .
" the nazis hated all of those things . " emphasizing achievements students in nazi uniforms celebrated the book burnings while their professors stood nearby , an element the new project aims to explore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmund freud 's work was also targeted it 's also why the mendelssohn center wants the library to grace many german schools with its presence .
as a result , the foundation hopes that each " library " will be made up of 316 volumes at a cost of about 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,200 -rrb- .
the entire project is estimated to cost around 5 million euros .
the financing is now being considered and schoeps is optimistic . the new library will also strongly emphasize the achievements of modern germany .
the exiled academics will thus at least symbolically return to germany , the country that persecuted them and forced them to flee . igal avidan -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de creators praise popularity of berlin holocaust monument as the holocaust memorial in berlin nears its first anniversary , initiators looked back at a year of controversy - and success .

the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .

much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .

" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .

" we are prepared to work on a cooperation package and support iran 's development of a proliferation-proof civilian nuclear program , " she said , according to ap news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while reaching out to iran , plassnik said the eu will look to other measures if rejected plassnik added that eu officials were also considering economic assistance , political cooperation as ways to encourage tehran to drop ambitions for a nuclear program that could be used to produce atomic weapons .
the west fears that iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon behind the screen of a civilian atomic energy program .
tehran says it only wants to generate energy . " the intention is not to push iran into further isolation but to find a way to bring iran back to a negotiating track , " plassnik said .
" but we will also look at measures to be taken should iran continue to reject this course . " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , however , told the ambassadors of britain , france and germany monday that any halt to uranium enrichment was " unacceptable , " the official irna news agency reported . " any call for a suspension or pause -lrb- in uranium enrichment -rrb- is illogical and unacceptable and will without any doubt be rejected , " the ministry quoted mottaki as saying .
" tehran is ready to negotiate and would welcome any constructive proposal which both guarantees iran 's legitimate rights and helps settle the nuclear issue . " a " bold offer " ? the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana meanwhile said the bloc could offer the islamic republic " the most sophisticated " technology to help its power needs . " we want to prove to the iranians that we have nothing against iran to use nuclear power for peaceful means , " he told reporters , adding that the bloc would present tehran with a " bold offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear plant in iran " if they want to construct nuclear energy power plants they will have , in cooperation with the european union and other members of the international community , the best and most sophisticated technology , " solana said .
" if they reject that it will mean that what they want is something different . " the eu , whose package must also satisfy russia and china , has until may 19 - when negotiators from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany meet in london - to complete its work . last cha n ces ? solana played down comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , rejecting any new eu offer that might demand that the islamic republic halt uranium enrichment activities .
he added that the iranians had yet to see the bloc 's offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has hardened his stance as a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran has the right to build a civilian nuclear program , but it must submit to inspections by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un watchdog body .
it has refused to fully cooperate with the agency and ahmadinejad has pledged to forge ahead as international pressure to give up enrichment has increased . " this is one of the last chances to resolve this conflict from a diplomatic point of view , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters .
" we are ready to cooperate in the civilian nuclear domain and in trade and political areas .
i think the iranians are going to understand that the europeans are courageous and are proposing something very important .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .
he said the new measure also meant that " journalists may not be used as sources " and indicated that high-ranking officials at the bnd could lose their jobs over the affair .
" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .
" then we will confront the issue of what conclusions to draw in terms of personnel , " he said . the new order only covers the bnd 's protection of its own work - the sole area in which the agency is allowed by law to conduct operations on german soil . the bnd may , however , use journalists as contacts in its foreign operations , wilhelm said . he said he could not answer questions about whether the new rules apply to the office for the protection of the constitution - the domestic intelligence agency , or the military counter-intelligence service . bnd allegedly spied on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are believed to have been targeted by the bnd the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press . former bnd chief volker foertsch has also admitted that journalists had sometimes been used as informers . " the aim of the contacts was to prevent publication of prejudicial articles and find out where the journalists were getting their information from inside the bnd , " he was quoted by another newspaper , the berliner zeitung , as saying . however , former bnd president hansjörg geiger has denied that he allowed any spying of journalists during his term between 1996 and 1998 .
" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd . "
he insisted that the chancellery was not informed . stasi-like methods ? the murky affair is a political bombshell in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the post-war period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom .
it has sparked hot debate with politicians across party lines calling for a full investigation . " even intelligence services have to act within their capacity , the limits have evidently been crossed in this affair , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives .
bosbach added that he expected " personnel consequences " at the bnd because even superiors seemed to have known about the incidents . " this is n't just a trifling matter but rather an extraordinarily grave issue , " said ralf stegner of the social democratic party .
" we will have to get to the bottom of it . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp likened the affair to the methods of the stasi , the secret police of former communist east germany and warned that it could in particular lead to a deep disenchantment in the country 's east . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german agents spied on journalists german intelligence officials kept tabs on the professional and private lives of journalists in a widening scandal as the agency celebrates its 50th year .

marriage some 2.2 million marriages were registered in 2004 , or 4.8 marriages per 1,000 inhabitants .
but nearly a million divorces - 2.1 per 1,000 inhabitants - were registered in the same period . it appears cypriots , danes and maltese are the most marrying kind in this union of some 450 million people in 25 member states .
the cypriots clocked up 7.2 nuptials per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by denmark with seven and the maltese with six . at the other end of the marriage market come the slovenes with 3.3 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by the belgians with 4.1 and the greeks with 4.2 .
divorce meanwhile the czechs and lithuanians lead the field when it comes to divorce with 3.2 per 1,000 inhabitants each , followed by the estonians and the belgians .
bildunterschrift : almost half of all children in scandinavia and the baltics are born out of wedlock malta , ireland and italy , where the influence of the roman catholic church is particularly strong , have the lowest divorce rates .
in fact , malta has none because divorce is not allowed on the mediterranean island .
in ireland and italy the rate stands at respectively 0.7 and 0.8 divorces per 1,000 inhabitants .
births but the power of religion does not explain all and is reflected only partially in the birth rate .
ireland has the highest birth rate in the eu with 15.2 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by france with 12.7 , and britain , denmark and luxembourg each with 12 . italy and poland - another strong catholic country - meanwhile register a birth rate below the eu average of 10.5 with 9.7 and 9.3 respectively .
the germans are the least prolific europeans when it comes to begetting , with a rate of only 8.6 , closely behind the latvians with 8.8 and the lithuanians with 8.9 .
illegitimacy nearly a third - 31.6 percent - of the 4.8 million babies born in the european union in 2004 were born out of wedlock .
the phenomenon is particularly noticeable up north in scandinavia and the three baltic member states with a ratio of 57.8 percent in estonia , 55.4 percent in sweden , 45.4 percent in denmark and 45.3 percent in latvia .
france also has a relatively high level of 45.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the highest proportion of one-parent families in the eu the lowest levels of children born out of wedlock are to be found in southern europe with only 3.3 percent in cyprus , 4.9 percent in greece and 14.9 percent in italy .
among the eastern european newcomers to the eu , poland has a rate of 17.2 percent .
by contrast , ireland in the west has an eu average rate of 31.4 percent . the cypriots take first prize for family size , with 10 percent of families made up of three or more children , compared to a 4 percent average throughout the 25 membe states . britain has the largest proportion of one-parent families , with 24 percent of households thus designated , followed by belgium with 18 percent , estonia with 17 percent , denmark and germany with 16 percent each , latvia with 15 percent and france with 14 percent . household expenditures household expenditure reveals an almost equally distributed preponderance of expenditure on housing and attendant costs such gas , electricity and water taking up 21 percent of family budgets on average . only the cypriots , lithuanians , maltese and portuguese spend more on food and transport than on housing .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients . " " existential damage " to care ?
likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .
the vud has asked for mediation in the case , and members are meeting in berlin this week to discuss the topic , association chief jörg-rüdiger siewert told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
the president of the society for german hospitals , rudolf kösters , has called for doctors to stop putting patients in the firing line when it comes to their contract negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .
we ’ re trying to make up for this with rationalization measures and more intelligent solutions concerning the treatment of patients .
we ’ re in the process of working out a scheme which will enable us to survive with fewer , but better-paid doctors .

about 10,000 so-called " un-german " titles went up in flames and disappeared from public life .
most of the authors were persecuted and had to flee the country and some even murdered . in order to remember such barbarism and victimization of authors , the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies in potsdam is launching a " library of burned books . "
and even though the financing for the project has not yet been secured , its promoters are hard-pressed to keep quiet about the project . " the point is to collect a selection of these titles , " said julius schoeps , who runs the center and initiated the project .
" this library should be on a few bookshelves and tour more than 3,000 high schools .
we believe this is a type of living memorial , more important than one made of stone or iron . " books by jews , pacifists , foreigners burned " where one burns books , one burns humanity , " wrote heinrich heine , long before his books were burned by the nazis .

more than a third of the authors were jewish but in only one out of 10 cases was that listed as a reason for their books being banned .
about 20 percent of the authors were foreigners whose works were popular in german translation , such as jack london or ernest hemingway . " either the authors were jewish or the author 's books were pacifist and against the war , or they were concerned with sexuality or new educational methods , " said schoeps .

the 29-year-old midfielder 's arrival had been confirmed by chelsea boss jose mourinho on sunday . " he believes in us , he believes in chelsea , he believes we can have success , " mourinho said .
" he chose chelsea and we are very happy , and i think also english football should be happy to have such a player playing in the premiership . " ballack is expected to be the first of three big signings by chelsea this summer .
the germany captain is expected to be followed by ac milan 's ukrainian striker andriy shevchenko .
inter milan 's adriano and corinthians star carlos tevez have also been heavily linked with moves to chelsea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will still head the german national team ballack will reportedly become the highest-paid player in the premiership on a deal said to be worth 130,000 pounds -lrb- 190,700 euros , $ 245,700 -rrb- per week .
but ballack insists that the need for a new challenge rather than financial gain was the deciding factor behind the move . dreami n g of champio n s league title london will be ballack 's first foray outside his native germany , something he announced he wished to experience .
born in the former east germany , he began his professional career at division two side chemnitz .
he then went on to play for kaiserslautern and bayer leverkusen before moving to bayern munich for 12.9 million euros in 2002 after turninng down real madrid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping his eyes on the ball the hope was to add to the 1998 german championship he won with kaiserslautern and capture the champions league crown after going to close with bayer leverkusen in 2002 - when they lost 2-1 to real madrid in the final . domestic titles were forthcoming , with three league and cup doubles in four seasons -lrb- 2003 , 2005 , 2006 -rrb- but the champions league proved out of reach and ballack feels he has a better chance of winning europe 's flagship competition in chelsea 's colors . " i did not win anything at leverkusen so to win six titles in four years with bayern shows the move was worthwhile , " ballack said .
" i hope now i can realize my dream of winning the champions league . " chelsea have won successive premiership titles at a canter but have come up short in the champions league - losing to liverpool in the semi-final last year and barcelona in the last 16 this season - and mourinho will hope ballack can provide the final push . leavi n g a sour taste i n mu n ich ballack guarantees goals from midfield and in his final season at bayern he scored 14 league goals to help the club defend the title .
on the international stage ballack has bagged 30 goals in 63 internationals - a record befitting of a striker - since making his debut in april 1999 . bankrolled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , chelsea probably paid more than 25 million euros plus for ballack .
he effectively became a free agent when he turned down a four-year contract at bayern in september , prompting interest from manchester united , inter milan and real madrid . chelsea waited in the wings and opened negotiations in january after other clubs baulked at ballack 's personal demands .
bayern accepted the player was leaving but a sour taste was left in the mouth as ballack did not publicly say he was joining chelsea until television pictures showed him arriving at london on sunday . bildunterschrift : he wo n't be celebrating with bayern any more in his final games for bayern , ballack was jeered by his own fans and labeled a mercenary by the club management .
his loss is a real blow for the 20-time german champions and german soccer who have lost their biggest star ahead of next month 's world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de champions again but bayern plan makeover to remain on top with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .

" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .
he said the new measure also meant that " journalists may not be used as sources " and indicated that high-ranking officials at the bnd could lose their jobs over the affair .
" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .
" then we will confront the issue of what conclusions to draw in terms of personnel , " he said . the new order only covers the bnd 's protection of its own work - the sole area in which the agency is allowed by law to conduct operations on german soil . the bnd may , however , use journalists as contacts in its foreign operations , wilhelm said . he said he could not answer questions about whether the new rules apply to the office for the protection of the constitution - the domestic intelligence agency , or the military counter-intelligence service . bnd allegedly spied on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are believed to have been targeted by the bnd the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press . former bnd chief volker foertsch has also admitted that journalists had sometimes been used as informers . " the aim of the contacts was to prevent publication of prejudicial articles and find out where the journalists were getting their information from inside the bnd , " he was quoted by another newspaper , the berliner zeitung , as saying . however , former bnd president hansjörg geiger has denied that he allowed any spying of journalists during his term between 1996 and 1998 .
" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd . "
he insisted that the chancellery was not informed . stasi-like methods ? the murky affair is a political bombshell in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the post-war period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom .
it has sparked hot debate with politicians across party lines calling for a full investigation . " even intelligence services have to act within their capacity , the limits have evidently been crossed in this affair , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives .
bosbach added that he expected " personnel consequences " at the bnd because even superiors seemed to have known about the incidents . " this is n't just a trifling matter but rather an extraordinarily grave issue , " said ralf stegner of the social democratic party .
" we will have to get to the bottom of it . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp likened the affair to the methods of the stasi , the secret police of former communist east germany and warned that it could in particular lead to a deep disenchantment in the country 's east . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german agents spied on journalists german intelligence officials kept tabs on the professional and private lives of journalists in a widening scandal as the agency celebrates its 50th year .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .

but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .

but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .

about 10,000 so-called " un-german " titles went up in flames and disappeared from public life .
most of the authors were persecuted and had to flee the country and some even murdered . in order to remember such barbarism and victimization of authors , the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies in potsdam is launching a " library of burned books . "
and even though the financing for the project has not yet been secured , its promoters are hard-pressed to keep quiet about the project . " the point is to collect a selection of these titles , " said julius schoeps , who runs the center and initiated the project .
" this library should be on a few bookshelves and tour more than 3,000 high schools .
we believe this is a type of living memorial , more important than one made of stone or iron . " books by jews , pacifists , foreigners burned " where one burns books , one burns humanity , " wrote heinrich heine , long before his books were burned by the nazis .
shortly after that , philosopher and political writer theodor lessing was shot in exile and pacifist and nobel prize winner carl von ossietzky died in a concentration camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine 's books were burned by the nazis works by sigmund freud , heinrich heine , bertolt brecht , kurt tucholsky , thomas mann , stefan zweig and anna seghers landed on the pyre .

germany manager jürgen klinsmann sprung two major surprises in his 23-man world cup squad on monday with uncapped midfielder david odonkor and veteran defender jens nowotny included for next month 's finals . borussia dortmund midfielder odonkor has never been called up to the germany squad but finds himself in the final world cup party . klinsmann said he hopes the 22-year-old can add some creativity in midfield after bayern munich star sebastian deisler was ruled out with a knee injury . " odonkor can give us something we are missing , " klinsmann said .
" we need something after -lrb- sebastian -rrb- deisler 's injury .
he is quick , carefree and has a lot to offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he was delighted when i informed him over the phone .
i just told him that he does not need to worry .
he has under-21 caps and we are taking half that team with us to the world cup . " bayer leverkusen defender nowotny was the other shock inclusion as he had not played for the national team for two years . nowotny back from injury the 32-year-old nowotny won the last of his 45 caps at euro 2004 but klinsmann hopes he can bring some experience to a youthful defense .
" jens nowotny brings a lot of experience .
he has played in lot of tournaments and knows what it takes , " klinsmann said . " we need different alternatives in central defense as -lrb- christoph -rrb- metzelder is still struggling with injury , " klinsmann added . dortmund defender metzelder is out for two weeks but is also included in the 23-man squad . while there was delight for odonkor and nowotny there was heartache for brazilian-born striker kevin kuranyi who paid the price for a poor season with schalke 04 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year ago kuranyi was first choice in attack but his form dipped and klinsmann only has him on standby with vfl wolfsburg forward mike hanke taking his place . the 22-year-old hanke is suspended for the first two world cup matches against costa rica and poland after receiving a red card in last year 's confederations cup third-place play-off with mexico .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients . " " existential damage " to care ?
likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .
the vud has asked for mediation in the case , and members are meeting in berlin this week to discuss the topic , association chief jörg-rüdiger siewert told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
the president of the society for german hospitals , rudolf kösters , has called for doctors to stop putting patients in the firing line when it comes to their contract negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .
we ’ re trying to make up for this with rationalization measures and more intelligent solutions concerning the treatment of patients .

the 29-year-old midfielder 's arrival had been confirmed by chelsea boss jose mourinho on sunday . " he believes in us , he believes in chelsea , he believes we can have success , " mourinho said .
" he chose chelsea and we are very happy , and i think also english football should be happy to have such a player playing in the premiership . " ballack is expected to be the first of three big signings by chelsea this summer .
the germany captain is expected to be followed by ac milan 's ukrainian striker andriy shevchenko .
inter milan 's adriano and corinthians star carlos tevez have also been heavily linked with moves to chelsea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will still head the german national team ballack will reportedly become the highest-paid player in the premiership on a deal said to be worth 130,000 pounds -lrb- 190,700 euros , $ 245,700 -rrb- per week .
but ballack insists that the need for a new challenge rather than financial gain was the deciding factor behind the move . dreami n g of champio n s league title london will be ballack 's first foray outside his native germany , something he announced he wished to experience .
born in the former east germany , he began his professional career at division two side chemnitz .
he then went on to play for kaiserslautern and bayer leverkusen before moving to bayern munich for 12.9 million euros in 2002 after turninng down real madrid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping his eyes on the ball the hope was to add to the 1998 german championship he won with kaiserslautern and capture the champions league crown after going to close with bayer leverkusen in 2002 - when they lost 2-1 to real madrid in the final . domestic titles were forthcoming , with three league and cup doubles in four seasons -lrb- 2003 , 2005 , 2006 -rrb- but the champions league proved out of reach and ballack feels he has a better chance of winning europe 's flagship competition in chelsea 's colors . " i did not win anything at leverkusen so to win six titles in four years with bayern shows the move was worthwhile , " ballack said .
" i hope now i can realize my dream of winning the champions league . " chelsea have won successive premiership titles at a canter but have come up short in the champions league - losing to liverpool in the semi-final last year and barcelona in the last 16 this season - and mourinho will hope ballack can provide the final push . leavi n g a sour taste i n mu n ich ballack guarantees goals from midfield and in his final season at bayern he scored 14 league goals to help the club defend the title .
on the international stage ballack has bagged 30 goals in 63 internationals - a record befitting of a striker - since making his debut in april 1999 . bankrolled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , chelsea probably paid more than 25 million euros plus for ballack .
he effectively became a free agent when he turned down a four-year contract at bayern in september , prompting interest from manchester united , inter milan and real madrid . chelsea waited in the wings and opened negotiations in january after other clubs baulked at ballack 's personal demands .
bayern accepted the player was leaving but a sour taste was left in the mouth as ballack did not publicly say he was joining chelsea until television pictures showed him arriving at london on sunday . bildunterschrift : he wo n't be celebrating with bayern any more in his final games for bayern , ballack was jeered by his own fans and labeled a mercenary by the club management .

" we are prepared to work on a cooperation package and support iran 's development of a proliferation-proof civilian nuclear program , " she said , according to ap news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while reaching out to iran , plassnik said the eu will look to other measures if rejected plassnik added that eu officials were also considering economic assistance , political cooperation as ways to encourage tehran to drop ambitions for a nuclear program that could be used to produce atomic weapons .
the west fears that iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon behind the screen of a civilian atomic energy program .
tehran says it only wants to generate energy . " the intention is not to push iran into further isolation but to find a way to bring iran back to a negotiating track , " plassnik said .
" but we will also look at measures to be taken should iran continue to reject this course . " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , however , told the ambassadors of britain , france and germany monday that any halt to uranium enrichment was " unacceptable , " the official irna news agency reported . " any call for a suspension or pause -lrb- in uranium enrichment -rrb- is illogical and unacceptable and will without any doubt be rejected , " the ministry quoted mottaki as saying .
" tehran is ready to negotiate and would welcome any constructive proposal which both guarantees iran 's legitimate rights and helps settle the nuclear issue . " a " bold offer " ? the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana meanwhile said the bloc could offer the islamic republic " the most sophisticated " technology to help its power needs . " we want to prove to the iranians that we have nothing against iran to use nuclear power for peaceful means , " he told reporters , adding that the bloc would present tehran with a " bold offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear plant in iran " if they want to construct nuclear energy power plants they will have , in cooperation with the european union and other members of the international community , the best and most sophisticated technology , " solana said .
" if they reject that it will mean that what they want is something different . " the eu , whose package must also satisfy russia and china , has until may 19 - when negotiators from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany meet in london - to complete its work . last cha n ces ? solana played down comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , rejecting any new eu offer that might demand that the islamic republic halt uranium enrichment activities .
he added that the iranians had yet to see the bloc 's offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has hardened his stance as a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran has the right to build a civilian nuclear program , but it must submit to inspections by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un watchdog body .
it has refused to fully cooperate with the agency and ahmadinejad has pledged to forge ahead as international pressure to give up enrichment has increased . " this is one of the last chances to resolve this conflict from a diplomatic point of view , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters .

by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients . " " existential damage " to care ?
likewise , the association of german university hospitals -lrb- vud -rrb- warned of the " existential damage " being done to patient care .
the vud has asked for mediation in the case , and members are meeting in berlin this week to discuss the topic , association chief jörg-rüdiger siewert told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
the president of the society for german hospitals , rudolf kösters , has called for doctors to stop putting patients in the firing line when it comes to their contract negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .
we ’ re trying to make up for this with rationalization measures and more intelligent solutions concerning the treatment of patients .
we ’ re in the process of working out a scheme which will enable us to survive with fewer , but better-paid doctors .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .

" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .

" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd . "
he insisted that the chancellery was not informed . stasi-like methods ? the murky affair is a political bombshell in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the post-war period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom .
it has sparked hot debate with politicians across party lines calling for a full investigation . " even intelligence services have to act within their capacity , the limits have evidently been crossed in this affair , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.05.2006 eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief solana hopes iran will accept the bloc 's offer top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs . speaking after a meeting of the bloc 's foreign ministers , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , said that the european union would also work towards political and economic cooperation with iran . " we are prepared to work on a cooperation package and support iran 's development of a proliferation-proof civilian nuclear program , " she said , according to ap news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while reaching out to iran , plassnik said the eu will look to other measures if rejected plassnik added that eu officials were also considering economic assistance , political cooperation as ways to encourage tehran to drop ambitions for a nuclear program that could be used to produce atomic weapons .
the west fears that iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon behind the screen of a civilian atomic energy program .
tehran says it only wants to generate energy . " the intention is not to push iran into further isolation but to find a way to bring iran back to a negotiating track , " plassnik said .
" but we will also look at measures to be taken should iran continue to reject this course . " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , however , told the ambassadors of britain , france and germany monday that any halt to uranium enrichment was " unacceptable , " the official irna news agency reported . " any call for a suspension or pause -lrb- in uranium enrichment -rrb- is illogical and unacceptable and will without any doubt be rejected , " the ministry quoted mottaki as saying .
" tehran is ready to negotiate and would welcome any constructive proposal which both guarantees iran 's legitimate rights and helps settle the nuclear issue . " a " bold offer " ? the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana meanwhile said the bloc could offer the islamic republic " the most sophisticated " technology to help its power needs . " we want to prove to the iranians that we have nothing against iran to use nuclear power for peaceful means , " he told reporters , adding that the bloc would present tehran with a " bold offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear plant in iran " if they want to construct nuclear energy power plants they will have , in cooperation with the european union and other members of the international community , the best and most sophisticated technology , " solana said .
" if they reject that it will mean that what they want is something different . " the eu , whose package must also satisfy russia and china , has until may 19 - when negotiators from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany meet in london - to complete its work . last cha n ces ? solana played down comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , rejecting any new eu offer that might demand that the islamic republic halt uranium enrichment activities .
he added that the iranians had yet to see the bloc 's offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has hardened his stance as a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran has the right to build a civilian nuclear program , but it must submit to inspections by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un watchdog body .
it has refused to fully cooperate with the agency and ahmadinejad has pledged to forge ahead as international pressure to give up enrichment has increased . " this is one of the last chances to resolve this conflict from a diplomatic point of view , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters .
" we are ready to cooperate in the civilian nuclear domain and in trade and political areas .
i think the iranians are going to understand that the europeans are courageous and are proposing something very important . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran insists european offer must recognize enrichment right iran on saturday warned that new european incentives to find a deal over its atomic program would only be of interest if the offer recognized the country 's right to uranium enrichment .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .
but those warm relations have now almost become irrelevant . " it 's a paradoxical development .
europeanness has renationalized the left , " said bolaffi .
" the national parties no longer have any relations with each other - it 's all dealt with in brussels . " " curious to meet kurt beck " that 's the domain of the socialist group in the european parliament -lrb- spe -rrb- .
the umbrella organization headquartered in brussels organizes twice-yearly meetings for the top brass of europe 's social democratic parties , said spe spokesman julian scola .
in addition , there are regular ministerial meetings where social democratic opposition spokespersons take part . usually , fundamental questions are discussed .
thus , for instance a meeting of finance ministers would involve growth and investment strategies for europe .
" the parties do influence each other mutually , " said scola .
" a change in leadership in one party is naturally of interest to leaders of other parties too . " scola added that beck 's appointment meant that the spd had an experienced new head . " he 's coming to a meeting of social democrat heads in june .
the other leaders are naturally very curious to meet him .

-lrb- may 14 , 2006 -rrb- beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .
the party needs continuity , and that 's what he 'll give it , the 57-year old said .

the cypriots clocked up 7.2 nuptials per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by denmark with seven and the maltese with six . at the other end of the marriage market come the slovenes with 3.3 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by the belgians with 4.1 and the greeks with 4.2 .

in ireland and italy the rate stands at respectively 0.7 and 0.8 divorces per 1,000 inhabitants .
births but the power of religion does not explain all and is reflected only partially in the birth rate .
ireland has the highest birth rate in the eu with 15.2 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by france with 12.7 , and britain , denmark and luxembourg each with 12 . italy and poland - another strong catholic country - meanwhile register a birth rate below the eu average of 10.5 with 9.7 and 9.3 respectively .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .
but those warm relations have now almost become irrelevant . " it 's a paradoxical development .
europeanness has renationalized the left , " said bolaffi .
" the national parties no longer have any relations with each other - it 's all dealt with in brussels . " " curious to meet kurt beck " that 's the domain of the socialist group in the european parliament -lrb- spe -rrb- .
the umbrella organization headquartered in brussels organizes twice-yearly meetings for the top brass of europe 's social democratic parties , said spe spokesman julian scola .
in addition , there are regular ministerial meetings where social democratic opposition spokespersons take part . usually , fundamental questions are discussed .
thus , for instance a meeting of finance ministers would involve growth and investment strategies for europe .
" the parties do influence each other mutually , " said scola .
" a change in leadership in one party is naturally of interest to leaders of other parties too . " scola added that beck 's appointment meant that the spd had an experienced new head . " he 's coming to a meeting of social democrat heads in june .
the other leaders are naturally very curious to meet him .

" the chancellery ordered the bnd today not to undertake operative measures against journalists for its own protection , " wilhelm told a regular government news conference .
he said the new measure also meant that " journalists may not be used as sources " and indicated that high-ranking officials at the bnd could lose their jobs over the affair .
" the government regrets the incidents , " wilhelm added . damning parliamentary report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel attended the bnd 's 50th anniversary last week the move comes in the wake of the publication of a confidential parliamentary report that says the bnd had spied on far more journalists working for german publications than was previously known and had recruited reporters to spy on their colleagues in order to get to the source of damaging articles .
the bnd 's activities reportedly dated from the early 1980s until as recently as last year . wilhelm said the bnd had been told to answer questions this week posed by the parliamentary oversight committee .
" then we will confront the issue of what conclusions to draw in terms of personnel , " he said . the new order only covers the bnd 's protection of its own work - the sole area in which the agency is allowed by law to conduct operations on german soil . the bnd may , however , use journalists as contacts in its foreign operations , wilhelm said . he said he could not answer questions about whether the new rules apply to the office for the protection of the constitution - the domestic intelligence agency , or the military counter-intelligence service . bnd allegedly spied on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists from several german publications are believed to have been targeted by the bnd the bnd had also apparently placed several journalists from various german publications under surveillance for some years in order to find out the source of leaks from the bnd to the press . former bnd chief volker foertsch has also admitted that journalists had sometimes been used as informers . " the aim of the contacts was to prevent publication of prejudicial articles and find out where the journalists were getting their information from inside the bnd , " he was quoted by another newspaper , the berliner zeitung , as saying . however , former bnd president hansjörg geiger has denied that he allowed any spying of journalists during his term between 1996 and 1998 .
" during my term , i explicitly saw to it that the bnd was not allowed to use any journalist as a source , " geiger said in a newspaper interview . former chancellor helmut kohl 's intelligence advisor , bernd schmidbauer , has accused geiger of ordering in 1996 that a journalist be deployed to " clear up leaks from the bnd . "
he insisted that the chancellery was not informed . stasi-like methods ? the murky affair is a political bombshell in a country that has been particularly sensitive in the post-war period to any abuses of power at the security services or violations of press freedom .
it has sparked hot debate with politicians across party lines calling for a full investigation . " even intelligence services have to act within their capacity , the limits have evidently been crossed in this affair , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives .
bosbach added that he expected " personnel consequences " at the bnd because even superiors seemed to have known about the incidents . " this is n't just a trifling matter but rather an extraordinarily grave issue , " said ralf stegner of the social democratic party .
" we will have to get to the bottom of it . " sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister and member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp likened the affair to the methods of the stasi , the secret police of former communist east germany and warned that it could in particular lead to a deep disenchantment in the country 's east . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german agents spied on journalists german intelligence officials kept tabs on the professional and private lives of journalists in a widening scandal as the agency celebrates its 50th year .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .

who 's kurt beck ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck will have to work hard to spread his popularity beyond germany 's borders germany 's center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- elected kurt beck as its new leader on sunday .
the moderate politician may be popular in germany , but he 's an unknown among social democrats in the rest of europe . it did n't take long for germany 's spd to find a new leader when matthias platzeck stunned the party last month , saying he was standing down for health reasons .
within days , the choice of successor fell on kurt beck , the bearded 57-year-old premier of the state of rheinland-palatinate . largely seen as a moderate within the spd , beck was voted to the top post with an overwhelming 95.1 percent on sunday at a special party conference . beck 's appointment as leader of germany 's oldest political party is a natural choice and does n't signal a fundamental shift in the party 's ideological content , said party researcher peter lösche .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck , left , with the younger platzeck " beck was the most obvious alternative after platzeck .
no one else in the spd is as popular and knows the party so well from within , " lösche said , adding that with its 600,000 members , the spd is a complex and intricate organizational behemoth . " platzeck 's problem was that he could never really understand the party , " lösche said .
platzeck is the premier of the eastern german state of brandenburg , and as lösche pointed out , only 30,000 of the spd 's members come from the eastern part of the country . on the other hand , beck has so far been a regional leader and therefore has little experience with foreign policy , lösche added . a virtual unknown in europe notwithstanding beck 's popularity in germany , he remains a virtual unknown among social democrats in europe . " other big social democratic parties in europe have n't really registered the fact that kurt beck is head of the german spd , " said lösche .
" it 's just business as usual .
beck stands for continuity , after all . " his appointment stands in sharp contrast to tony blair 's when he became the successor to british labor party head john smith .
" that was an exciting turn of events for the social democrats because with blair 's appointment , labor developed into a completely new party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair gets along better with merkel than he did with schröder , say some observers nobody in britain 's labor party is really interested in the fact that germany 's new social democratic boss is called kurt beck , said charles lees , political scientist at the university of sheffield .
much more significant for labor was the change of german chancellor from gerhard schröder to the incumbent angela merkel , lees added . " even if nobody will say it publicly , the blair government gets along much better with angela merkel , " lees said .
conservatives such as italy 's silvio berlusconi or spain 's josé maria aznar have been blair 's closest allies on a european level . lees pointed out that , at the time when labor was reinventing itself in the mid-1990s , there were several links and contacts between social democratic parties in europe . " when we look at the situation today , the social democrat family has become much more heterogonous .
i would even doubt whether the social democrats in continental europe still regard blair as a part of the family , " lees said . national differences he added that in order to develop the social democrat platform and ideology further , exchange between the parties was much more important than prevailing national structures .
" germany 's federal structure makes it less attractive than in britain for the party to move to the center in order to get out of the role of the opposition , " lees said , adding that in times when the spd played the role of opposition party at the federal level , it at least had access to power on a regional level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is a very different party from blair 's labour in addition , german party law which lays down inner-party structures makes it impossible for the spd to allow a relatively small leading group to push the party in a particular direction , as was the case with labor . angelo bolaffi , political scientist at the university of la sapienza in rome said that dialog between germany 's spd and italy 's socialists had also waned .
italy 's communist party , which despite its name developed into a real social democratic party in the 1970s , had close ties to the spd .
but those warm relations have now almost become irrelevant . " it 's a paradoxical development .
europeanness has renationalized the left , " said bolaffi .
" the national parties no longer have any relations with each other - it 's all dealt with in brussels . " " curious to meet kurt beck " that 's the domain of the socialist group in the european parliament -lrb- spe -rrb- .
the umbrella organization headquartered in brussels organizes twice-yearly meetings for the top brass of europe 's social democratic parties , said spe spokesman julian scola .
in addition , there are regular ministerial meetings where social democratic opposition spokespersons take part . usually , fundamental questions are discussed .
thus , for instance a meeting of finance ministers would involve growth and investment strategies for europe .
" the parties do influence each other mutually , " said scola .
" a change in leadership in one party is naturally of interest to leaders of other parties too . " scola added that beck 's appointment meant that the spd had an experienced new head . " he 's coming to a meeting of social democrat heads in june .
the other leaders are naturally very curious to meet him .

" we are prepared to work on a cooperation package and support iran 's development of a proliferation-proof civilian nuclear program , " she said , according to ap news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while reaching out to iran , plassnik said the eu will look to other measures if rejected plassnik added that eu officials were also considering economic assistance , political cooperation as ways to encourage tehran to drop ambitions for a nuclear program that could be used to produce atomic weapons .
the west fears that iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon behind the screen of a civilian atomic energy program .
tehran says it only wants to generate energy . " the intention is not to push iran into further isolation but to find a way to bring iran back to a negotiating track , " plassnik said .
" but we will also look at measures to be taken should iran continue to reject this course . " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , however , told the ambassadors of britain , france and germany monday that any halt to uranium enrichment was " unacceptable , " the official irna news agency reported . " any call for a suspension or pause -lrb- in uranium enrichment -rrb- is illogical and unacceptable and will without any doubt be rejected , " the ministry quoted mottaki as saying .
" tehran is ready to negotiate and would welcome any constructive proposal which both guarantees iran 's legitimate rights and helps settle the nuclear issue . " a " bold offer " ? the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana meanwhile said the bloc could offer the islamic republic " the most sophisticated " technology to help its power needs . " we want to prove to the iranians that we have nothing against iran to use nuclear power for peaceful means , " he told reporters , adding that the bloc would present tehran with a " bold offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear plant in iran " if they want to construct nuclear energy power plants they will have , in cooperation with the european union and other members of the international community , the best and most sophisticated technology , " solana said .
" if they reject that it will mean that what they want is something different . " the eu , whose package must also satisfy russia and china , has until may 19 - when negotiators from the security council 's five permanent members plus germany meet in london - to complete its work . last cha n ces ? solana played down comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , rejecting any new eu offer that might demand that the islamic republic halt uranium enrichment activities .
he added that the iranians had yet to see the bloc 's offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad has hardened his stance as a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran has the right to build a civilian nuclear program , but it must submit to inspections by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un watchdog body .
it has refused to fully cooperate with the agency and ahmadinejad has pledged to forge ahead as international pressure to give up enrichment has increased . " this is one of the last chances to resolve this conflict from a diplomatic point of view , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn told reporters .
" we are ready to cooperate in the civilian nuclear domain and in trade and political areas .
i think the iranians are going to understand that the europeans are courageous and are proposing something very important .

he then went on to play for kaiserslautern and bayer leverkusen before moving to bayern munich for 12.9 million euros in 2002 after turninng down real madrid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping his eyes on the ball the hope was to add to the 1998 german championship he won with kaiserslautern and capture the champions league crown after going to close with bayer leverkusen in 2002 - when they lost 2-1 to real madrid in the final . domestic titles were forthcoming , with three league and cup doubles in four seasons -lrb- 2003 , 2005 , 2006 -rrb- but the champions league proved out of reach and ballack feels he has a better chance of winning europe 's flagship competition in chelsea 's colors . " i did not win anything at leverkusen so to win six titles in four years with bayern shows the move was worthwhile , " ballack said .
" i hope now i can realize my dream of winning the champions league . " chelsea have won successive premiership titles at a canter but have come up short in the champions league - losing to liverpool in the semi-final last year and barcelona in the last 16 this season - and mourinho will hope ballack can provide the final push . leavi n g a sour taste i n mu n ich ballack guarantees goals from midfield and in his final season at bayern he scored 14 league goals to help the club defend the title .
on the international stage ballack has bagged 30 goals in 63 internationals - a record befitting of a striker - since making his debut in april 1999 . bankrolled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , chelsea probably paid more than 25 million euros plus for ballack .
he effectively became a free agent when he turned down a four-year contract at bayern in september , prompting interest from manchester united , inter milan and real madrid . chelsea waited in the wings and opened negotiations in january after other clubs baulked at ballack 's personal demands .
bayern accepted the player was leaving but a sour taste was left in the mouth as ballack did not publicly say he was joining chelsea until television pictures showed him arriving at london on sunday . bildunterschrift : he wo n't be celebrating with bayern any more in his final games for bayern , ballack was jeered by his own fans and labeled a mercenary by the club management .
his loss is a real blow for the 20-time german champions and german soccer who have lost their biggest star ahead of next month 's world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de champions again but bayern plan makeover to remain on top with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance .

patients in the affected hospitals will have to make do with emergency care . after failed final-round talks in dresden on thursday , the opposing sides - the marburger bund physicians ' union on the one hand and the german state tariff association -lrb- tdl -rrb- on the other - are at an impasse .
there are currently no plans for further talks . the doctors have categorically refused the tdl offer , and marburger bund spokesman athanasios drougias told ap news service the union will only be ready to talk again when the states put up a new , better offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want ' good money for good work , ' according to this sign held by a protesting physician , in march .
but the tariff association said it will not budge from its current offer , which involves longer working hours and differentiated wage increases .
by its own account , the tdl has said it is counting on the " understanding " of the 22,000 doctors involved , who they think are unlikely to hold out long in the face of a protracted strike . " i think most of the doctors are looking at our offer , " a tariff association spokesman told ap .
" right now , a new offer is not being considered . " however , the marburger bund says almost all of the doctors involved will walk off the job . ' record breaking ' strike " well more than 10,000 at a given time " will strike , drougias said .
up to now , doctors at different clinics had been hosting rotating , day-long protest strikes , which did n't cut too deeply into the medical services offered . the current strike will be " record-breaking , " drougias said .
university hospitals and psychiatric state hospitals in nearly 40 cities across germany will be affected . the parties are under increasing pressure to reach a speedy accord , however . german health minister ulla schmidt called on both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and " finally find a solution … in the interest of the patients .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one action , doctors trade places with window cleaners to show how poorly they were paid .
the head of the marburger bund , frank-ullrich montgomery , said he is aware that many citizens have little understanding for the doctors ’ demands for a 30 percent wage increase .
but , he said , the clinic-based physicians are just trying to regain what employers had taken from them in recent years . “ they ’ ve been trying all along to reduce our wages by 30 percent through the back door , " he said . doctors are hoping for moral support from patients , even though non-urgent operations will have to be postponed even further due to the extended strike action .
the doctors say that they would earn much more in most other west european nations and point out that more than 6,000 clinic doctors have already left germany in pursuit of better working conditions elsewhere . the protracted strike action has cost clinics millions of euros in the past eight weeks in terms of lost revenues from patient treatment .
the director of the university clinic in mainz , peter galle , says a financial disaster is just around the corner . financial woes “ the management reckons that at the end of this week our deficit will have risen by another 1 million euros .

marriage some 2.2 million marriages were registered in 2004 , or 4.8 marriages per 1,000 inhabitants .
but nearly a million divorces - 2.1 per 1,000 inhabitants - were registered in the same period . it appears cypriots , danes and maltese are the most marrying kind in this union of some 450 million people in 25 member states .
the cypriots clocked up 7.2 nuptials per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by denmark with seven and the maltese with six . at the other end of the marriage market come the slovenes with 3.3 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by the belgians with 4.1 and the greeks with 4.2 .
divorce meanwhile the czechs and lithuanians lead the field when it comes to divorce with 3.2 per 1,000 inhabitants each , followed by the estonians and the belgians .
bildunterschrift : almost half of all children in scandinavia and the baltics are born out of wedlock malta , ireland and italy , where the influence of the roman catholic church is particularly strong , have the lowest divorce rates .
in fact , malta has none because divorce is not allowed on the mediterranean island .
in ireland and italy the rate stands at respectively 0.7 and 0.8 divorces per 1,000 inhabitants .
births but the power of religion does not explain all and is reflected only partially in the birth rate .
ireland has the highest birth rate in the eu with 15.2 per 1,000 inhabitants , followed by france with 12.7 , and britain , denmark and luxembourg each with 12 . italy and poland - another strong catholic country - meanwhile register a birth rate below the eu average of 10.5 with 9.7 and 9.3 respectively .
the germans are the least prolific europeans when it comes to begetting , with a rate of only 8.6 , closely behind the latvians with 8.8 and the lithuanians with 8.9 .
illegitimacy nearly a third - 31.6 percent - of the 4.8 million babies born in the european union in 2004 were born out of wedlock .
the phenomenon is particularly noticeable up north in scandinavia and the three baltic member states with a ratio of 57.8 percent in estonia , 55.4 percent in sweden , 45.4 percent in denmark and 45.3 percent in latvia .
france also has a relatively high level of 45.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has the highest proportion of one-parent families in the eu the lowest levels of children born out of wedlock are to be found in southern europe with only 3.3 percent in cyprus , 4.9 percent in greece and 14.9 percent in italy .
among the eastern european newcomers to the eu , poland has a rate of 17.2 percent .
by contrast , ireland in the west has an eu average rate of 31.4 percent . the cypriots take first prize for family size , with 10 percent of families made up of three or more children , compared to a 4 percent average throughout the 25 membe states . britain has the largest proportion of one-parent families , with 24 percent of households thus designated , followed by belgium with 18 percent , estonia with 17 percent , denmark and germany with 16 percent each , latvia with 15 percent and france with 14 percent . household expenditures household expenditure reveals an almost equally distributed preponderance of expenditure on housing and attendant costs such gas , electricity and water taking up 21 percent of family budgets on average . only the cypriots , lithuanians , maltese and portuguese spend more on food and transport than on housing .

" odonkor can give us something we are missing , " klinsmann said .
" we need something after -lrb- sebastian -rrb- deisler 's injury .
he is quick , carefree and has a lot to offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he was delighted when i informed him over the phone .

south gloucestershire council is about to adopt multi agency risk assessment conferences -lrb- maracs -rrb- .
the system provides a forum for sharing information and taking action to reduce future harm to high-risk victims .
liz richardson , from bristol , who spent 13 years with an abusive husband , said the approach is " brilliant news " .
joined-up help " when your husband is agressive and likes drink and hitting you , you believe the violence is your fault because he tells you it is , " said liz .
" having people to talk to who can help get you and your children to safety is so important , " she said . "
everyone thought the sun shone out of my husband so it was difficult to know who to trust " liz richardson domestic violence victim it took liz a number of attempts to leave her husband as she did not know who to turn to for help .
" everyone thought the sun shone out of my husband so it was difficult to know who to trust and i had my children , aged 10 and five to consider , " said liz .
" i tried talking to my health visitor but could n't quite tell her what was happening because i thought i was a bad person and i asked to be rehoused by the council but i could n't say why .
" this approach should mean those details would be picked up and noticed by the relevant bodies , " she said .

sightings of the mammal were significantly down last year , possibly due to a shortage of sprats on which they feed .

the marine charity is to begin monitoring for minke whales over the next few weeks .

dr evans added : " last year , there was a shortage of sprats .
" we are not sure why , but it may have been related to oceanographic changes .
" we suspect that the minke whales shifted their distribution since minkes had a good summer further south in the irish sea as well as off eastern scotland . "
the charity 's national whale and dolphin watch this year will be held from 12 to 20 august .

ballot boxes have been arriving at four central counting stations from electorates across the south pacific .
according to elections supervisor semesa karavaki , a final count could be available by late tuesday .
the poll has been held in a racially charged atmosphere , with indigenous fijians worried that the country 's ethnic indians might seize control .
mr qarase , an indigenous fijian , is running against ethnic indian opposition leader mahendra chaudhry .
observers fear that whatever the result of the poll , the outcome could trigger violence .
police and soldiers are closely monitoring the situation .
pre-election pledges polls finally closed on saturday after the seven-day election .
collecting ballots is a complicated business in fiji , which has 300 far-flung inhabited islands .
the government has reported a provisional turnout of about 300,000 people , or about 64 % , of registered voters .
mr qarase said on monday that he had not changed his polling forecast that his indigenous-dominated soqosoqo duavata ni lewenivanua -lrb- sdl -rrb- party would win 42 of the 71 seats in parliament .
last week he pledged that if he won , he would form a government which included native and ethnic indian fijians .
" we will have probably the most multi-racial line-up on a government side in any general election since independence , " he said .
but his rival , ethnic indian mr chaudhry , insisted that " no one will take him seriously " .
ethnic tensions have dominated fijian politics since 2000 , when a coup deposed mr chaudhry , then serving as the country 's first ethnic indian prime minister .

the government has reported a provisional turnout of about 300,000 people , or about 64 % , of registered voters .
mr qarase said on monday that he had not changed his polling forecast that his indigenous-dominated soqosoqo duavata ni lewenivanua -lrb- sdl -rrb- party would win 42 of the 71 seats in parliament .
last week he pledged that if he won , he would form a government which included native and ethnic indian fijians .
" we will have probably the most multi-racial line-up on a government side in any general election since independence , " he said .
but his rival , ethnic indian mr chaudhry , insisted that " no one will take him seriously " .
ethnic tensions have dominated fijian politics since 2000 , when a coup deposed mr chaudhry , then serving as the country 's first ethnic indian prime minister .

the most important next step for the ellesmere port is to make sure it gets the next model of astra according to professor rhys .

we will be meeting with japanese manufacturers who employ uk workers and explore options for sourcing our car fleet from them " derek simpson , amicus general secretary and remarks by gm europe boss carl-peter forster raised fears uk job cuts are in the pipeline , when he was reported to have said spreading redundancies across its european plants was " not super attractive " .
gm europe is seeking to cut 12,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting plans .
but amicus general secretary , derek simpson said : " unless gm are prepared to treat decent men and women in britain with some dignity we will cancel our £ 8m -lrb- $ 15m -rrb- contract for vauxhall cars .
" we will encourage our members to buy their cars from a manufacturer who supports the british economy and urge other unions to do the same .
" we will be meeting with japanese manufacturers who employ uk workers and explore options for sourcing our car fleet from them . "
labour legislation mr simpson will meet mps at the house of commons on tuesday to present " incontrovertible proof " that weak uk labour laws are leading to the demise of the uk car manufacturing industry .
analysts are now saying that dropping one of the plant 's three shifts was increasingly likely .
professor garel rhys , at the centre for automotive industry research at cardiff university on monday 's radio 4 's today programme said he thought it was a " done deal . "
the union says that labour laws in the uk allow employers to fire workers with more ease than their european counterparts , and that this was behind recent job losses at peugeot , ryton , tvr " and now potentially vauxhall " .
amicus also says that the vauxhall astra was the uk 's number one best-selling new car in april " and sold 25,171 cars , a massive 3,072 more than ford , due to the hard work and commitment of its workers " .
the most important next step for the ellesmere port is to make sure it gets the next model of astra according to professor rhys .
" it needs to show it is an efficient home for this model , " he said , adding that gm has already made a " huge investment " in the plant .
meanwhile , the union says one million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the uk since 1997 , and those who are made redundant have struggled to find comparable employment .

she said : " we hope this scheme will eventually result in a network of breastfeeding-friendly premises opening their doors to new mums all over wales .

called the eye of judgement , the game uses real cards which , thanks to a camera on the console , come to life as mythical creatures on screen .
sony demonstrated the game at last week 's e3 games expo in los angeles .
the game forms part of the line-up of titles for the new console which is due to go on sale in november .
strategic decisions the eye of judgement takes the idea of top trumps into the world of augmented reality .
it uses physical cards which are placed in turn by players on a three-by-three grid .
a camera attached to the ps3 reads a hidden code on the cards to produce a character or monster on screen , each one of which has its own special powers .

the annual award marks the very best in popular science writing for children under the age of 14 - and dk has managed to grab the top prize an unprecedented five times in the last six years .
the news that another dk book , johnny ball 's think of a number , has been short-listed for the 2006 prize makes the chance of dk claiming the crown for a sixth time a real possibility .
so what is the secret behind the publisher 's success ?
miriam farbey is children 's publisher at dk and has been responsible for commissioning and publishing all of the winning books .
she believes the answer lies in the books ' visual-appeal : " dk children 's books started in about 1987 , and its aim was , and still is , to show you things that other books only tell you .
" dk was really the first publishing company to use pictures as much as they use words , and that 's something we still very much do today . "
attention grabbing she argues that children today are constantly surrounded by visual media : album covers ; the television ; computer games ; and particularly the internet .
and dk books , she believes , tap into this and appeal to children who are perhaps reluctant readers .
dk 's award-winning titles 2000 : dk guide to space by peter bond 2001 : dk guide to weather by michael allaby 2002 : dk guide to the human body by richard walker 2003 : dk guide to the oceans by frances dipper 2005 : what makes me , me by robert winston the " dk look " used in its children 's science books is distinctive .
subjects are displayed on colourful double-page spreads , and striking pictures , graphics , and text are carried throughout the page to illustrate various concepts .
" i think how words and pictures work together is extremely important .
i think that 's particularly true in what makes me , me ; which won the aventis prize in 2005 , " explained ms farbey .
" we really make the words , as well as the pictures , fun to look at . "
jane bull , creative director at dk , said the editorial and design teams worked very closely together when creating a new book , and had a clear aim of what they wanted to achieve .
" the look is very bright and cheerful , but it still looks authoritative .
they are fun - but they would n't be out of place in a classroom , " she said .
dk 's design uses bold colours and strong images " we aim to make the books look approachable , but at the same time breaking down the levels of information , so if you are looking at a spread , you can look at it on different levels .
" you draw the reader in , so if they see something , they can read the heading , just look at the sentence across the bottom of the page , or something else might catch their eye . "
making maths visual but , explained miriam farbey , while design was important , dk still placed a lot of emphasis on content .
" from a business perspective we know that we are seen as the quality educational trusted brand , " she said .
" we do our research , we do our fact-checking , we use our experts .
in any science-based media , you do have to get all of the fundamentals right . " 2006 aventis junior shortlist think of a number by johnny ball 100 science experiments by georgina andrews and kate knighton it 's true !
squids suck by nicki greenberg blame my brain by nicola morgan global garden by kate petty and jennie maizels kingfisher knowledge : forensics by richard platt the latest contender for the aventis prize , think of a number - johnny ball 's first book for 18 years - initially posed a challenge to the team .
mathematics is not an obviously visual subject .
" if you think about geometry and algebra , there are actually very beautiful patterns and shapes , and although the team struggled in the beginning , they found lots of ways of showing that maths is in fact a visually interesting subject , " explained ms farbey .
author and maths-enthusiast johnny ball said the book had wide appeal : " i think the book does what i hoped it would do - and that is to really broaden out maths and to tell children about the maths that we do n't see and we 're not familiar with . "
he said that the dk way of working did cause some constraints - he would have liked to have packed more information into the book - but he is pleased with the outcome and also very pleased with being nominated for the prize .
ball and dk now face a nervous wait for the results of the prize , which will be announced at an awards ceremony at the royal society on 16 may .
unlike the general prize , which is selected by a panel of judges , the junior prize is chosen by children .
" we will be delighted if we win .
it is a mark that says we are producing the best science books , and not just this , but the books that the children like , " ms farbey told the bbc news website .

the annual award marks the very best in popular science writing for children under the age of 14 - and dk has managed to grab the top prize an unprecedented five times in the last six years .
the news that another dk book , johnny ball 's think of a number , has been short-listed for the 2006 prize makes the chance of dk claiming the crown for a sixth time a real possibility .
so what is the secret behind the publisher 's success ?
miriam farbey is children 's publisher at dk and has been responsible for commissioning and publishing all of the winning books .
she believes the answer lies in the books ' visual-appeal : " dk children 's books started in about 1987 , and its aim was , and still is , to show you things that other books only tell you .
" dk was really the first publishing company to use pictures as much as they use words , and that 's something we still very much do today . "
attention grabbing she argues that children today are constantly surrounded by visual media : album covers ; the television ; computer games ; and particularly the internet .
and dk books , she believes , tap into this and appeal to children who are perhaps reluctant readers .

" i think how words and pictures work together is extremely important .
i think that 's particularly true in what makes me , me ; which won the aventis prize in 2005 , " explained ms farbey .
" we really make the words , as well as the pictures , fun to look at . "
jane bull , creative director at dk , said the editorial and design teams worked very closely together when creating a new book , and had a clear aim of what they wanted to achieve .
" the look is very bright and cheerful , but it still looks authoritative .
they are fun - but they would n't be out of place in a classroom , " she said .
dk 's design uses bold colours and strong images " we aim to make the books look approachable , but at the same time breaking down the levels of information , so if you are looking at a spread , you can look at it on different levels .
" you draw the reader in , so if they see something , they can read the heading , just look at the sentence across the bottom of the page , or something else might catch their eye . "
making maths visual but , explained miriam farbey , while design was important , dk still placed a lot of emphasis on content .
" from a business perspective we know that we are seen as the quality educational trusted brand , " she said .
" we do our research , we do our fact-checking , we use our experts .
in any science-based media , you do have to get all of the fundamentals right . " 2006 aventis junior shortlist think of a number by johnny ball 100 science experiments by georgina andrews and kate knighton it 's true !

mathematics is not an obviously visual subject .
" if you think about geometry and algebra , there are actually very beautiful patterns and shapes , and although the team struggled in the beginning , they found lots of ways of showing that maths is in fact a visually interesting subject , " explained ms farbey .
author and maths-enthusiast johnny ball said the book had wide appeal : " i think the book does what i hoped it would do - and that is to really broaden out maths and to tell children about the maths that we do n't see and we 're not familiar with . "
he said that the dk way of working did cause some constraints - he would have liked to have packed more information into the book - but he is pleased with the outcome and also very pleased with being nominated for the prize .
ball and dk now face a nervous wait for the results of the prize , which will be announced at an awards ceremony at the royal society on 16 may .

some are scattered with colourful flowers , others plush and green , and a few with a felt-like carpet of vegetation .
but this pretty spot has a remarkable history , for it is the site of the world 's oldest ongoing ecological experiment .
the park grass experiment has had a huge impact on the study of biodiversity and ecology - and this year marks its 150th anniversary .
the experiment was set up in 1856 by john lawes - founder of the research institution now known as rothamsted research - and his scientific collaborator , joseph gilbert .
it was originally established to answer a crucial agricultural question of the day : how do different fertilisers affect hay yield .
a hay field was divided up into 20 grids , each measuring about 20m by 60m -lrb- 70x195ft -rrb- , and each plot was treated with various combinations of fertilisers - including different types of nitrogen fertilisers , ammonium sulphate , sodium nitrate , and later , manure ; and they also added phosphates , potassium and even silica .
a bonus for botanists " you could say the original reason they had started it had been satisfied by the 1880s , " said professor jonathan silvertown , an ecologist from the open university , milton keynes , who has worked intermittently on the park grass experiment for the last 30 years .
" it was completely clear by then what the effects of fertilisers on hay were , but something they had n't expected was that you had all of these changes of species composition on different plots .
" at that point , they noted that the experiment was now of more interest to botanists than it was to agriculturists . "
as the decades passed , some changes to the original grid were made .
in 1903 , most of the plots were split and one half was treated with lime to test the effects of acidification .
in 1965 , most plots were divided into four sub-plots , and the ph of the soil was adjusted to phs of five , six and seven , or left unchanged . "
we need to be able to understand the past in order to predict the future " professor silvertown , open university over the years , the plots began to look dramatically different - and scientists were able to make some astonishing discoveries from studying these numerous combinations of nutrients , acidity , grasses and plants .
one hundred and seventy publications have resulted from the park grass experiment to date .
evolutionary changes professor silvertown highlighted two important findings .
he said the experiment had shown an interesting relationship between nutrients and species ' populations .
" you might think the more nutrients you add , the more species you get - when in fact completely the opposite happens .
the more nutrients you add , the fewer species you get .
and although perhaps quite a lot of people know that these days , it was discovered at park grass , " he said .
this is because the plants that can use the nutrients best , he said , push out the competition .
" the park grass experiment has also revealed that evolution has taken place in the plots , " professor silvertown told the bbc news website .
" for example , you have a plot that has become very acid because it has had ammonium sulphate added to it for 150 years and next to it is a plot that has no ammonium sulphate added .
" and some of the plants have evolved adaptations to the plot they are growing on - so if you move plants to another plot they grow much better or worse depending on the soil conditions .
this reveals the power of natural selection and how it can shape adaptation on a very local scale . "
nuclear fall-out while field-study has been ongoing , so has the diligent collection of plants and soils from the plots , resulting in a collection of 150 years worth of samples .
dr keith goulding is an ecologist at rothamsted research , and , like professor silvertown , has been working with the park grass experiment for 30 years .
he says this wealth of archived material has allowed research into some unexpected areas .
" some scientists from southampton analysed plutonium , uranium and caesium on the grass samples , " he said .
" they were able to identify plutonium coming from nuclear tests , and because of the sensitive equipment they used , they could tell exactly which nuclear tests it came from .
" we 've done the same tests for other atmospheric pollutants , like dioxins and pcbs , to see how these have changed over the last 150 years . "
future plans more recent research has included looking into the impact of climate change on ecology , by investigating the impact of increasing co2 levels on the grasses .
dr goulding says the long-term nature of the project makes it impossible to assess where the next discoveries will be - but the long timescales are essential for understanding future ecological problems , especially surrounding issues such as climate change " so many of the environmental problems that we face are long-term , " he said .
" short-term experiments are very good for answering specific questions , but if we want to develop truly sustainable environmental systems we need to look at them in the long-term .
" our experiments and others like them around the world are the best way to do this . "
professor silvertown agrees : " we need to be able to understand the past in order to predict the future .
" if we can understand how plant communities are influenced , for example , by climate , then you can predict what might happen in the future . "
it seems unlikely that lawes and gilbert could have predicted that their original agricultural endeavour would remain active for a century and a half , let alone yield the advances in ecology that it has .
yet the 2.8-hectare -lrb- 6.9 acres -rrb- site is still answering the questions that arise from our ever-changing environment , and professor goulding believes it will do so well into the future .
" it wo n't be me stood here asking the questions in 150 years ' time ; but i 'm certain somebody else will be . "

" short-term experiments are very good for answering specific questions , but if we want to develop truly sustainable environmental systems we need to look at them in the long-term .

professor silvertown agrees : " we need to be able to understand the past in order to predict the future .

it seems unlikely that lawes and gilbert could have predicted that their original agricultural endeavour would remain active for a century and a half , let alone yield the advances in ecology that it has .

some are scattered with colourful flowers , others plush and green , and a few with a felt-like carpet of vegetation .
but this pretty spot has a remarkable history , for it is the site of the world 's oldest ongoing ecological experiment .
the park grass experiment has had a huge impact on the study of biodiversity and ecology - and this year marks its 150th anniversary .
the experiment was set up in 1856 by john lawes - founder of the research institution now known as rothamsted research - and his scientific collaborator , joseph gilbert .
it was originally established to answer a crucial agricultural question of the day : how do different fertilisers affect hay yield .
a hay field was divided up into 20 grids , each measuring about 20m by 60m -lrb- 70x195ft -rrb- , and each plot was treated with various combinations of fertilisers - including different types of nitrogen fertilisers , ammonium sulphate , sodium nitrate , and later , manure ; and they also added phosphates , potassium and even silica .
a bonus for botanists " you could say the original reason they had started it had been satisfied by the 1880s , " said professor jonathan silvertown , an ecologist from the open university , milton keynes , who has worked intermittently on the park grass experiment for the last 30 years .
harvesting park grass in 1941 " it was completely clear by then what the effects of fertilisers on hay were , but something they had n't expected was that you had all of these changes of species composition on different plots .
" at that point , they noted that the experiment was now of more interest to botanists than it was to agriculturists . "
as the decades passed , some changes to the original grid were made .
in 1903 , most of the plots were split and one half was treated with lime to test the effects of acidification .
in 1965 , most plots were divided into four sub-plots , and the ph of the soil was adjusted to phs of five , six and seven , or left unchanged .
we need to be able to understand the past in order to predict the future professor silvertown , open university over the years , the plots began to look dramatically different - and scientists were able to make some astonishing discoveries from studying these numerous combinations of nutrients , acidity , grasses and plants .
one hundred and seventy publications have resulted from the park grass experiment to date .
evolutionary changes professor silvertown highlighted two important findings .
he said the experiment had shown an interesting relationship between nutrients and species ' populations .
" you might think the more nutrients you add , the more species you get - when in fact completely the opposite happens .
the more nutrients you add , the fewer species you get .
and although perhaps quite a lot of people know that these days , it was discovered at park grass , " he said .
plants like dandelions grow more readily in some plots this is because the plants that can use the nutrients best , he said , push out the competition .
" the park grass experiment has also revealed that evolution has taken place in the plots , " professor silvertown told the bbc news website .
" for example , you have a plot that has become very acid because it has had ammonium sulphate added to it for 150 years and next to it is a plot that has no ammonium sulphate added .
" and some of the plants have evolved adaptations to the plot they are growing on - so if you move plants to another plot they grow much better or worse depending on the soil conditions .
this reveals the power of natural selection and how it can shape adaptation on a very local scale . "
nuclear fall-out while field-study has been ongoing , so has the diligent collection of plants and soils from the plots , resulting in a collection of 150 years worth of samples .
samples of soil and hay are taken and stored dr keith goulding is an ecologist at rothamsted research , and , like professor silvertown , has been working with the park grass experiment for 30 years .
he says this wealth of archived material has allowed research into some unexpected areas .
" some scientists from southampton analysed plutonium , uranium and caesium on the grass samples , " he said .
" they were able to identify plutonium coming from nuclear tests , and because of the sensitive equipment they used , they could tell exactly which nuclear tests it came from .
" we 've done the same tests for other atmospheric pollutants , like dioxins and pcbs , to see how these have changed over the last 150 years . "
