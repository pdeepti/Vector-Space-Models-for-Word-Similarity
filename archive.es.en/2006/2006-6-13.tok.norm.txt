or can it make employees work longer ?
amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .
the deal was seen as extremely innovative at the time .
however , pay was not lowered in lockstep with working hours , and vw 's labor costs are now 20 percent higher than its competitors ' . buyout packages offered the 2004 accords also included an agreement not to lay off workers until the end of 2011 .
but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen . " in the negotiations monday , vw suggested a three-step restructuring model , which includes improving productivity , lowering production costs , and increasing efficiency .
no further details were available .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .
most of the other team members are inexperienced though , and play in lower divisions of the european leagues . togo 's loyal german fans but no matter what happens , the team will be able to rely on a dedicated group of fans that have gathered in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven klein -lrb- right -rrb- and fellow togo fan kossi aziabou " the outcome of the match against korea will be crucial , " said sven klein , co-founder of the german-togolese soccer fan club , which now claims to have over 1,000 members .
" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .
though the african nation lost the 2-1 match , its single goal against heavyweight argentina , was a triumph in the " group of death " that also includes serbia and montenegro and the netherlands . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german sparrow hawks flock to team togo when kossi aziabou and sven klein founded the german-togolese soccer fan club , they expected to be cheering for togo with a few friends at home .

" swiss coach kobi kuhn said monday he 's got a secret recipe to spike 1998 world cup winners france when they meet on tuesday in their opening world cup tie . " it 's up to us to come up with the recipe , but you do n't think i 'm going to divulge it in front of all of you do you ? " he said during the traditional eve of match press conference on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's magnin ludovic -lrb- right -rrb- fights for the ball with turkey 's nihat kahveci in a game in bern last november the wily silver haired 62-year old did reveal that he 'd got his team to watch tapes of the last two encounters - both draws - between the neighbors when they were paired together in the same world cup qualifier group . " i believe it 'll be pretty much the same kind of game as the last two , " kuhn said .
" the france team has only changed a little , but with one significant change and that 's thierry henry , who was n't around for the last games . " youngest team switzerland are the third youngest outfit in the competition , but kuhn dismissed fears that inexperience may play a role against world cup veterans france . " yes , my team are young , but they 're a young side that have a lot of experience playing club football at arsenal , leverkusen , lazio , " he said .
" they play alongside the greatest footballers in europe and have gained a lot of experience . " france 's secret weapon france meanwhile look set to turn to their " secret weapon " - marseille midfielder franck ribery - to inject new ideas into their attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck ribery -lrb- left -rrb- in a test game against china in france on june 7 french newspaper l 'equipe reported that ribery would replace the out-of-form david trezeguet as coach raymond domenech rips up his tactics book .
ribery , in just his fourth international appearance , would play alongside zinedine zidane and sylvain wiltord in a midfield designed to supply sole striker thierry henry , as the 1998 winners seek to bury the nightmare of their 2002 campaign when the team was knocked out during the group stage without scoring a single goal . midfield veteran claude makelele has been impressed by the young tyro . " frank is the sort of player who can bring a lot to a team in 15 or 20 minutes , " he said . zidane 's successor ? ribery only made his debut as a substitute in france 's friendly against mexico late last month and received a standing ovation from the 80,000 stade de france crowd .
the warm-up game against china last week will be remembered for djibril cisse 's broken leg , but ribery came off the bench to give the french attack new urgency and helped them to a 3-1 win . calls for ribery 's deployment also come as french soccer superstar zinedine zidane , who is 34 and plans to end his career after the world cup , is no longer seen as the team 's savior after his less than stellar performance during the preparation phase . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : switzerland after surviving a violent barrage in istanbul to beat turkey in the play-offs , facing the world 's best teams in germany will seem like a piece of cake to the swiss .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .
most of the other team members are inexperienced though , and play in lower divisions of the european leagues . togo 's loyal german fans but no matter what happens , the team will be able to rely on a dedicated group of fans that have gathered in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven klein -lrb- right -rrb- and fellow togo fan kossi aziabou " the outcome of the match against korea will be crucial , " said sven klein , co-founder of the german-togolese soccer fan club , which now claims to have over 1,000 members .
" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .

or can it make employees work longer ?
amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .
the deal was seen as extremely innovative at the time .
however , pay was not lowered in lockstep with working hours , and vw 's labor costs are now 20 percent higher than its competitors ' . buyout packages offered the 2004 accords also included an agreement not to lay off workers until the end of 2011 .
but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen . " in the negotiations monday , vw suggested a three-step restructuring model , which includes improving productivity , lowering production costs , and increasing efficiency .
no further details were available .

or can it make employees work longer ?
amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .
the deal was seen as extremely innovative at the time .
however , pay was not lowered in lockstep with working hours , and vw 's labor costs are now 20 percent higher than its competitors ' . buyout packages offered the 2004 accords also included an agreement not to lay off workers until the end of 2011 .
but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen . " in the negotiations monday , vw suggested a three-step restructuring model , which includes improving productivity , lowering production costs , and increasing efficiency .
no further details were available .

but one ngo hopes some of the focus will be on the lack of press freedom in the african nation . despite the controversy over player bonuses and the near loss of coach otto pfister , the togolese fans are over the moon about their country 's first-ever appearance at a world cup tournament .
even togolese exiles such as ali tchassanti - for years a resident of wuppertal , germany - have been caught up in the excitement .
a journalist , tchassanti has set up his own web site for the world cup , and has helped find cheap accommodation for togolese fans in germany .
in his enthusiasm , he 's been prepared to look the other way when it comes to some of his country 's problems , such as a poor record on press freedom . " it 's about the players who are playing for our country , " he said .
" we all stand united behind them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's national team many togolese share tchassanti 's view .
the world cup has brought the citizens of this tiny west african country together .
the conditions that togolese journalists normally have to work under have been forgotten for the moment . " for months now , the government has been trying to show a different face , " tchassanti said .
" for 13 months now , we have n't had any problems with press freedom .
we believe the government is trying to loosen up a bit because of the world cup .
but people know that journalists ca n't write whatever they feel like . " only togolese citizens living abroad can risk criticizing the government under president faure gnassingbe - and that only via the internet .
if a journalist in the capital , lome , were to write something critical , he or she would have to reckon with severe consequences . " you could be tortured , you could be put in prison , you could be killed , " said tchassanti .
" it 's always dangerous - there 's no real press freedom in togo . " togo not alone togo is not the only world cup participant to score poorly when it comes to press freedom .
according to katrin evers from the non-governmental organization reporters without borders , other nations in the tournament , such as mexico , are also repeat offenders . " no other latin american country is more dangerous for journalists at the moment -lrb- than mexico -rrb- , " said evers .
" two journalists have already been murdered so far this year , two were murdered last year and a third disappeared without a trace over a year ago . " yaotzin botello moved to berlin from mexico city five years ago , and since then has been working as a correspondent for the respected newspaper reforma .
he appreciates the security he enjoys in his new home . " i know of a journalist who reported extensively about the brutal murders of women in ciudad juarez - he was followed and beaten , " botello said .
" you do n't know if it 's people from the government or people from the drug dealers , but in any case , someone wanted to prevent anything more from being written about the murdered women of ciudad juarez . " for 15 years now , poor young women working in the mexican city close to the united states border have been the victims of ongoing abductions and murders .
more than 400 murders have so far been documented . corruption forgotten in mexico " we do n't know what the motive is , " said botello .
" we do n't know whether it 's tied to drugs or the mafia , there are many theories .
the assumption is that the police and local politicians are in on what 's going on .
the government repeatedly says that it 's investigating , but weeks and months go by and nothing happens . " journalists who attempt to report on corruption and prostitution in mexico are stopped by a variety of means .
they ca n't rely on any official protection , botello said . " there are practically no rules for doing journalism in mexico , " he said .
" the government does n't concern itself with reporters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mexico , soccer is the number one topic at the moment , these problems are n't being addressed .
mexico is in the grip of soccer fever , with the national team playing their second preliminary match on friday . " mexico is a soccer-mad country , " botello said .
" politically , everything can be going wrong , economically too .
the president could be corrupt - all the politicians could be corrupt - but soccer is the number one topic . " even if everything is revolving around the world cup at the moment , reporters without borders is still trying to make its voice heard as it calls for greater press freedom , because without it , democracy is worth little , evers said . " for reporters without borders , it 's important that we use every situation to create awareness , especially for those countries which do n't have a free press , in which people do n't have access to unbiased information , in which they do n't have free internet access , " she said .
" in tunisia and iran , for example , certain internet sites are blocked and people are put in prison for writing critical stories , so we need to use this platform to increase political pressure on such countries to allow press freedom and release imprisoned journalists .

" the states failing to use the funds correctly need to return to the straight and narrow , " said tiefensee . ahead of the meeting , several of the eastern german state premiers had called for making the terms of the solidarity pact more flexible and freeing up the funds for other purposes than those originally stipulated - a move also welcomed by klaus wowereit , mayor of cash-strapped berlin . " the list of criteria needs to be extended , " he said .
" this would solve the problem instantly . " instead , the outcome of the meeting was a decision to uphold the pact 's existing form . fierce debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the money not going where it 's most needed ?
the solidarity pact involves germans paying a surcharge of 2.5 percent on their taxes - small wonder then that the perceived waste of taxpayers ' money unleashed such fierce political debate . it recently emerged that thüringen and saxony-anhalt were intending to spend some of the solidarity pact funds on education , on the basis of it being conducive to economic growth , while , according to the finance ministry , the eastern german states spent just 39 percent of the allotted 8.5 billion euros on infrastructure in 2004 .
berlin , meanwhile , allegedly " misspent " 100 percent of its share . " we are not wasting anything , " insisted saxony-anhalt state premier wolfgang böhmer .
" even if we use it to pay teachers , police or administration costs , this does not amount to waste . " ailing economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been told to clean up its act thriving regions are still few and far between in the former communist east .
unemployment remains stubbornly high with about 20 percent - which is almost twice as high as in the more well-to-do western germany . only in the state of saxony , home to a number of old and new economy enterprises , is a self-sustaining economy within reach , and state premier georg milbradt angered his eastern colleagues by rejecting demands for a relaxation of the rules governing the funds . " i think the other eastern states are wrong in assuming the funds can be used more efficiently for purposes other than investments , " he said .
" expenditure on things like better education will also have to be financed once the transfers will have ceased in the future . " people not concrete but the leaders of four of the five regional states have said it 's better to invest in people rather than concrete , and that rebuilding the east is seen merely as a matter of urban planning . " we have enough asphalted paths through our forests and enough theme parks , " said thüringen 's finance minister birgit diezel .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .
most of the other team members are inexperienced though , and play in lower divisions of the european leagues . togo 's loyal german fans but no matter what happens , the team will be able to rely on a dedicated group of fans that have gathered in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven klein -lrb- right -rrb- and fellow togo fan kossi aziabou " the outcome of the match against korea will be crucial , " said sven klein , co-founder of the german-togolese soccer fan club , which now claims to have over 1,000 members .
" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .

" the states failing to use the funds correctly need to return to the straight and narrow , " said tiefensee . ahead of the meeting , several of the eastern german state premiers had called for making the terms of the solidarity pact more flexible and freeing up the funds for other purposes than those originally stipulated - a move also welcomed by klaus wowereit , mayor of cash-strapped berlin . " the list of criteria needs to be extended , " he said .
" this would solve the problem instantly . " instead , the outcome of the meeting was a decision to uphold the pact 's existing form . fierce debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the money not going where it 's most needed ?
the solidarity pact involves germans paying a surcharge of 2.5 percent on their taxes - small wonder then that the perceived waste of taxpayers ' money unleashed such fierce political debate . it recently emerged that thüringen and saxony-anhalt were intending to spend some of the solidarity pact funds on education , on the basis of it being conducive to economic growth , while , according to the finance ministry , the eastern german states spent just 39 percent of the allotted 8.5 billion euros on infrastructure in 2004 .
berlin , meanwhile , allegedly " misspent " 100 percent of its share . " we are not wasting anything , " insisted saxony-anhalt state premier wolfgang böhmer .
" even if we use it to pay teachers , police or administration costs , this does not amount to waste . " ailing economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been told to clean up its act thriving regions are still few and far between in the former communist east .
unemployment remains stubbornly high with about 20 percent - which is almost twice as high as in the more well-to-do western germany . only in the state of saxony , home to a number of old and new economy enterprises , is a self-sustaining economy within reach , and state premier georg milbradt angered his eastern colleagues by rejecting demands for a relaxation of the rules governing the funds . " i think the other eastern states are wrong in assuming the funds can be used more efficiently for purposes other than investments , " he said .
" expenditure on things like better education will also have to be financed once the transfers will have ceased in the future . " people not concrete but the leaders of four of the five regional states have said it 's better to invest in people rather than concrete , and that rebuilding the east is seen merely as a matter of urban planning . " we have enough asphalted paths through our forests and enough theme parks , " said thüringen 's finance minister birgit diezel .
" what we need is greater scope to invest in people 's minds .

" the states failing to use the funds correctly need to return to the straight and narrow , " said tiefensee . ahead of the meeting , several of the eastern german state premiers had called for making the terms of the solidarity pact more flexible and freeing up the funds for other purposes than those originally stipulated - a move also welcomed by klaus wowereit , mayor of cash-strapped berlin . " the list of criteria needs to be extended , " he said .
" this would solve the problem instantly . " instead , the outcome of the meeting was a decision to uphold the pact 's existing form . fierce debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the money not going where it 's most needed ?
the solidarity pact involves germans paying a surcharge of 2.5 percent on their taxes - small wonder then that the perceived waste of taxpayers ' money unleashed such fierce political debate . it recently emerged that thüringen and saxony-anhalt were intending to spend some of the solidarity pact funds on education , on the basis of it being conducive to economic growth , while , according to the finance ministry , the eastern german states spent just 39 percent of the allotted 8.5 billion euros on infrastructure in 2004 .
berlin , meanwhile , allegedly " misspent " 100 percent of its share . " we are not wasting anything , " insisted saxony-anhalt state premier wolfgang böhmer .
" even if we use it to pay teachers , police or administration costs , this does not amount to waste . " ailing economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been told to clean up its act thriving regions are still few and far between in the former communist east .
unemployment remains stubbornly high with about 20 percent - which is almost twice as high as in the more well-to-do western germany . only in the state of saxony , home to a number of old and new economy enterprises , is a self-sustaining economy within reach , and state premier georg milbradt angered his eastern colleagues by rejecting demands for a relaxation of the rules governing the funds . " i think the other eastern states are wrong in assuming the funds can be used more efficiently for purposes other than investments , " he said .
" expenditure on things like better education will also have to be financed once the transfers will have ceased in the future . " people not concrete but the leaders of four of the five regional states have said it 's better to invest in people rather than concrete , and that rebuilding the east is seen merely as a matter of urban planning . " we have enough asphalted paths through our forests and enough theme parks , " said thüringen 's finance minister birgit diezel .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .
most of the other team members are inexperienced though , and play in lower divisions of the european leagues . togo 's loyal german fans but no matter what happens , the team will be able to rely on a dedicated group of fans that have gathered in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven klein -lrb- right -rrb- and fellow togo fan kossi aziabou " the outcome of the match against korea will be crucial , " said sven klein , co-founder of the german-togolese soccer fan club , which now claims to have over 1,000 members .
" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .
though the african nation lost the 2-1 match , its single goal against heavyweight argentina , was a triumph in the " group of death " that also includes serbia and montenegro and the netherlands . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german sparrow hawks flock to team togo when kossi aziabou and sven klein founded the german-togolese soccer fan club , they expected to be cheering for togo with a few friends at home .

" swiss coach kobi kuhn said monday he 's got a secret recipe to spike 1998 world cup winners france when they meet on tuesday in their opening world cup tie . " it 's up to us to come up with the recipe , but you do n't think i 'm going to divulge it in front of all of you do you ? " he said during the traditional eve of match press conference on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's magnin ludovic -lrb- right -rrb- fights for the ball with turkey 's nihat kahveci in a game in bern last november the wily silver haired 62-year old did reveal that he 'd got his team to watch tapes of the last two encounters - both draws - between the neighbors when they were paired together in the same world cup qualifier group . " i believe it 'll be pretty much the same kind of game as the last two , " kuhn said .
" the france team has only changed a little , but with one significant change and that 's thierry henry , who was n't around for the last games . " youngest team switzerland are the third youngest outfit in the competition , but kuhn dismissed fears that inexperience may play a role against world cup veterans france . " yes , my team are young , but they 're a young side that have a lot of experience playing club football at arsenal , leverkusen , lazio , " he said .
" they play alongside the greatest footballers in europe and have gained a lot of experience . " france 's secret weapon france meanwhile look set to turn to their " secret weapon " - marseille midfielder franck ribery - to inject new ideas into their attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck ribery -lrb- left -rrb- in a test game against china in france on june 7 french newspaper l 'equipe reported that ribery would replace the out-of-form david trezeguet as coach raymond domenech rips up his tactics book .
ribery , in just his fourth international appearance , would play alongside zinedine zidane and sylvain wiltord in a midfield designed to supply sole striker thierry henry , as the 1998 winners seek to bury the nightmare of their 2002 campaign when the team was knocked out during the group stage without scoring a single goal . midfield veteran claude makelele has been impressed by the young tyro . " frank is the sort of player who can bring a lot to a team in 15 or 20 minutes , " he said . zidane 's successor ? ribery only made his debut as a substitute in france 's friendly against mexico late last month and received a standing ovation from the 80,000 stade de france crowd .
the warm-up game against china last week will be remembered for djibril cisse 's broken leg , but ribery came off the bench to give the french attack new urgency and helped them to a 3-1 win . calls for ribery 's deployment also come as french soccer superstar zinedine zidane , who is 34 and plans to end his career after the world cup , is no longer seen as the team 's savior after his less than stellar performance during the preparation phase . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : switzerland after surviving a violent barrage in istanbul to beat turkey in the play-offs , facing the world 's best teams in germany will seem like a piece of cake to the swiss .

but one ngo hopes some of the focus will be on the lack of press freedom in the african nation . despite the controversy over player bonuses and the near loss of coach otto pfister , the togolese fans are over the moon about their country 's first-ever appearance at a world cup tournament .
even togolese exiles such as ali tchassanti - for years a resident of wuppertal , germany - have been caught up in the excitement .
a journalist , tchassanti has set up his own web site for the world cup , and has helped find cheap accommodation for togolese fans in germany .
in his enthusiasm , he 's been prepared to look the other way when it comes to some of his country 's problems , such as a poor record on press freedom . " it 's about the players who are playing for our country , " he said .
" we all stand united behind them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's national team many togolese share tchassanti 's view .
the world cup has brought the citizens of this tiny west african country together .
the conditions that togolese journalists normally have to work under have been forgotten for the moment . " for months now , the government has been trying to show a different face , " tchassanti said .
" for 13 months now , we have n't had any problems with press freedom .
we believe the government is trying to loosen up a bit because of the world cup .
but people know that journalists ca n't write whatever they feel like . " only togolese citizens living abroad can risk criticizing the government under president faure gnassingbe - and that only via the internet .
if a journalist in the capital , lome , were to write something critical , he or she would have to reckon with severe consequences . " you could be tortured , you could be put in prison , you could be killed , " said tchassanti .
" it 's always dangerous - there 's no real press freedom in togo . " togo not alone togo is not the only world cup participant to score poorly when it comes to press freedom .
according to katrin evers from the non-governmental organization reporters without borders , other nations in the tournament , such as mexico , are also repeat offenders . " no other latin american country is more dangerous for journalists at the moment -lrb- than mexico -rrb- , " said evers .
" two journalists have already been murdered so far this year , two were murdered last year and a third disappeared without a trace over a year ago . " yaotzin botello moved to berlin from mexico city five years ago , and since then has been working as a correspondent for the respected newspaper reforma .
he appreciates the security he enjoys in his new home . " i know of a journalist who reported extensively about the brutal murders of women in ciudad juarez - he was followed and beaten , " botello said .
" you do n't know if it 's people from the government or people from the drug dealers , but in any case , someone wanted to prevent anything more from being written about the murdered women of ciudad juarez . " for 15 years now , poor young women working in the mexican city close to the united states border have been the victims of ongoing abductions and murders .
more than 400 murders have so far been documented . corruption forgotten in mexico " we do n't know what the motive is , " said botello .
" we do n't know whether it 's tied to drugs or the mafia , there are many theories .
the assumption is that the police and local politicians are in on what 's going on .
the government repeatedly says that it 's investigating , but weeks and months go by and nothing happens . " journalists who attempt to report on corruption and prostitution in mexico are stopped by a variety of means .
they ca n't rely on any official protection , botello said . " there are practically no rules for doing journalism in mexico , " he said .
" the government does n't concern itself with reporters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mexico , soccer is the number one topic at the moment , these problems are n't being addressed .
mexico is in the grip of soccer fever , with the national team playing their second preliminary match on friday . " mexico is a soccer-mad country , " botello said .
" politically , everything can be going wrong , economically too .
the president could be corrupt - all the politicians could be corrupt - but soccer is the number one topic . " even if everything is revolving around the world cup at the moment , reporters without borders is still trying to make its voice heard as it calls for greater press freedom , because without it , democracy is worth little , evers said . " for reporters without borders , it 's important that we use every situation to create awareness , especially for those countries which do n't have a free press , in which people do n't have access to unbiased information , in which they do n't have free internet access , " she said .
" in tunisia and iran , for example , certain internet sites are blocked and people are put in prison for writing critical stories , so we need to use this platform to increase political pressure on such countries to allow press freedom and release imprisoned journalists .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .
most of the other team members are inexperienced though , and play in lower divisions of the european leagues . togo 's loyal german fans but no matter what happens , the team will be able to rely on a dedicated group of fans that have gathered in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven klein -lrb- right -rrb- and fellow togo fan kossi aziabou " the outcome of the match against korea will be crucial , " said sven klein , co-founder of the german-togolese soccer fan club , which now claims to have over 1,000 members .
" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .
though the african nation lost the 2-1 match , its single goal against heavyweight argentina , was a triumph in the " group of death " that also includes serbia and montenegro and the netherlands . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german sparrow hawks flock to team togo when kossi aziabou and sven klein founded the german-togolese soccer fan club , they expected to be cheering for togo with a few friends at home .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .
most of the other team members are inexperienced though , and play in lower divisions of the european leagues . togo 's loyal german fans but no matter what happens , the team will be able to rely on a dedicated group of fans that have gathered in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven klein -lrb- right -rrb- and fellow togo fan kossi aziabou " the outcome of the match against korea will be crucial , " said sven klein , co-founder of the german-togolese soccer fan club , which now claims to have over 1,000 members .
" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .
though the african nation lost the 2-1 match , its single goal against heavyweight argentina , was a triumph in the " group of death " that also includes serbia and montenegro and the netherlands . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german sparrow hawks flock to team togo when kossi aziabou and sven klein founded the german-togolese soccer fan club , they expected to be cheering for togo with a few friends at home .

or can it make employees work longer ?
amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .
the deal was seen as extremely innovative at the time .
however , pay was not lowered in lockstep with working hours , and vw 's labor costs are now 20 percent higher than its competitors ' . buyout packages offered the 2004 accords also included an agreement not to lay off workers until the end of 2011 .
but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen .

zidane playing in his final world cup showed brief moments of his magic in the first half but looked tired in the second . the game was played at a relatively slow pace as the players struggled to cope with the hot conditions in stuttgart .
france had the slight upper hand in the first half .
the best goal-scoring opportunity , however , fell to swiss striker alexander frei in the 24th minute but he struck over the bar from close range after a tranquillo barnetta free kick bounced through untouched to hit the french post . france came close to scoring seven minutes later when newcomer franck ribery blasted a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the box .

but french goalkeeper fabien barthez somehow managed to keep the ball out with his foot . france struggled in the second half as zidane failed to shine and henry did little up front .
top prospect ribery , who started a game for france for the first time after impressive performances as a substitute in warm-up games , showed his skill at times but did not live up to the hype . both sides will be unhappy with the fact that so many players were booked in what was a largely clean game .
switzerland picked up 5 yellow cards and france 3 . all in all switzerland and france will probably be satisfied to have picked up a point but france will have to improve greatly if they are to have a chance at winning their second world cup title . dw staff -lrb- jas -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 dw-world.de 's complete coverage of the 2006 world cup .

" the states failing to use the funds correctly need to return to the straight and narrow , " said tiefensee . ahead of the meeting , several of the eastern german state premiers had called for making the terms of the solidarity pact more flexible and freeing up the funds for other purposes than those originally stipulated - a move also welcomed by klaus wowereit , mayor of cash-strapped berlin . " the list of criteria needs to be extended , " he said .
" this would solve the problem instantly . " instead , the outcome of the meeting was a decision to uphold the pact 's existing form . fierce debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the money not going where it 's most needed ?
the solidarity pact involves germans paying a surcharge of 2.5 percent on their taxes - small wonder then that the perceived waste of taxpayers ' money unleashed such fierce political debate . it recently emerged that thüringen and saxony-anhalt were intending to spend some of the solidarity pact funds on education , on the basis of it being conducive to economic growth , while , according to the finance ministry , the eastern german states spent just 39 percent of the allotted 8.5 billion euros on infrastructure in 2004 .
berlin , meanwhile , allegedly " misspent " 100 percent of its share . " we are not wasting anything , " insisted saxony-anhalt state premier wolfgang böhmer .
" even if we use it to pay teachers , police or administration costs , this does not amount to waste . " ailing economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been told to clean up its act thriving regions are still few and far between in the former communist east .
unemployment remains stubbornly high with about 20 percent - which is almost twice as high as in the more well-to-do western germany . only in the state of saxony , home to a number of old and new economy enterprises , is a self-sustaining economy within reach , and state premier georg milbradt angered his eastern colleagues by rejecting demands for a relaxation of the rules governing the funds . " i think the other eastern states are wrong in assuming the funds can be used more efficiently for purposes other than investments , " he said .
" expenditure on things like better education will also have to be financed once the transfers will have ceased in the future . " people not concrete but the leaders of four of the five regional states have said it 's better to invest in people rather than concrete , and that rebuilding the east is seen merely as a matter of urban planning . " we have enough asphalted paths through our forests and enough theme parks , " said thüringen 's finance minister birgit diezel .

" swiss coach kobi kuhn said monday he 's got a secret recipe to spike 1998 world cup winners france when they meet on tuesday in their opening world cup tie . " it 's up to us to come up with the recipe , but you do n't think i 'm going to divulge it in front of all of you do you ? " he said during the traditional eve of match press conference on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's magnin ludovic -lrb- right -rrb- fights for the ball with turkey 's nihat kahveci in a game in bern last november the wily silver haired 62-year old did reveal that he 'd got his team to watch tapes of the last two encounters - both draws - between the neighbors when they were paired together in the same world cup qualifier group . " i believe it 'll be pretty much the same kind of game as the last two , " kuhn said .
" the france team has only changed a little , but with one significant change and that 's thierry henry , who was n't around for the last games . " youngest team switzerland are the third youngest outfit in the competition , but kuhn dismissed fears that inexperience may play a role against world cup veterans france . " yes , my team are young , but they 're a young side that have a lot of experience playing club football at arsenal , leverkusen , lazio , " he said .
" they play alongside the greatest footballers in europe and have gained a lot of experience . " france 's secret weapon france meanwhile look set to turn to their " secret weapon " - marseille midfielder franck ribery - to inject new ideas into their attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck ribery -lrb- left -rrb- in a test game against china in france on june 7 french newspaper l 'equipe reported that ribery would replace the out-of-form david trezeguet as coach raymond domenech rips up his tactics book .
ribery , in just his fourth international appearance , would play alongside zinedine zidane and sylvain wiltord in a midfield designed to supply sole striker thierry henry , as the 1998 winners seek to bury the nightmare of their 2002 campaign when the team was knocked out during the group stage without scoring a single goal . midfield veteran claude makelele has been impressed by the young tyro . " frank is the sort of player who can bring a lot to a team in 15 or 20 minutes , " he said . zidane 's successor ? ribery only made his debut as a substitute in france 's friendly against mexico late last month and received a standing ovation from the 80,000 stade de france crowd .
the warm-up game against china last week will be remembered for djibril cisse 's broken leg , but ribery came off the bench to give the french attack new urgency and helped them to a 3-1 win . calls for ribery 's deployment also come as french soccer superstar zinedine zidane , who is 34 and plans to end his career after the world cup , is no longer seen as the team 's savior after his less than stellar performance during the preparation phase . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : switzerland after surviving a violent barrage in istanbul to beat turkey in the play-offs , facing the world 's best teams in germany will seem like a piece of cake to the swiss .

or can it make employees work longer ?
amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .
the deal was seen as extremely innovative at the time .
however , pay was not lowered in lockstep with working hours , and vw 's labor costs are now 20 percent higher than its competitors ' . buyout packages offered the 2004 accords also included an agreement not to lay off workers until the end of 2011 .
but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen . " in the negotiations monday , vw suggested a three-step restructuring model , which includes improving productivity , lowering production costs , and increasing efficiency .
no further details were available .

" the states failing to use the funds correctly need to return to the straight and narrow , " said tiefensee . ahead of the meeting , several of the eastern german state premiers had called for making the terms of the solidarity pact more flexible and freeing up the funds for other purposes than those originally stipulated - a move also welcomed by klaus wowereit , mayor of cash-strapped berlin . " the list of criteria needs to be extended , " he said .
" this would solve the problem instantly . " instead , the outcome of the meeting was a decision to uphold the pact 's existing form . fierce debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the money not going where it 's most needed ?
the solidarity pact involves germans paying a surcharge of 2.5 percent on their taxes - small wonder then that the perceived waste of taxpayers ' money unleashed such fierce political debate . it recently emerged that thüringen and saxony-anhalt were intending to spend some of the solidarity pact funds on education , on the basis of it being conducive to economic growth , while , according to the finance ministry , the eastern german states spent just 39 percent of the allotted 8.5 billion euros on infrastructure in 2004 .
berlin , meanwhile , allegedly " misspent " 100 percent of its share . " we are not wasting anything , " insisted saxony-anhalt state premier wolfgang böhmer .
" even if we use it to pay teachers , police or administration costs , this does not amount to waste . " ailing economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been told to clean up its act thriving regions are still few and far between in the former communist east .
unemployment remains stubbornly high with about 20 percent - which is almost twice as high as in the more well-to-do western germany . only in the state of saxony , home to a number of old and new economy enterprises , is a self-sustaining economy within reach , and state premier georg milbradt angered his eastern colleagues by rejecting demands for a relaxation of the rules governing the funds . " i think the other eastern states are wrong in assuming the funds can be used more efficiently for purposes other than investments , " he said .
" expenditure on things like better education will also have to be financed once the transfers will have ceased in the future . " people not concrete but the leaders of four of the five regional states have said it 's better to invest in people rather than concrete , and that rebuilding the east is seen merely as a matter of urban planning . " we have enough asphalted paths through our forests and enough theme parks , " said thüringen 's finance minister birgit diezel .
" what we need is greater scope to invest in people 's minds .

zidane playing in his final world cup showed brief moments of his magic in the first half but looked tired in the second . the game was played at a relatively slow pace as the players struggled to cope with the hot conditions in stuttgart .
france had the slight upper hand in the first half .
the best goal-scoring opportunity , however , fell to swiss striker alexander frei in the 24th minute but he struck over the bar from close range after a tranquillo barnetta free kick bounced through untouched to hit the french post . france came close to scoring seven minutes later when newcomer franck ribery blasted a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the box .

but one ngo hopes some of the focus will be on the lack of press freedom in the african nation . despite the controversy over player bonuses and the near loss of coach otto pfister , the togolese fans are over the moon about their country 's first-ever appearance at a world cup tournament .
even togolese exiles such as ali tchassanti - for years a resident of wuppertal , germany - have been caught up in the excitement .
a journalist , tchassanti has set up his own web site for the world cup , and has helped find cheap accommodation for togolese fans in germany .
in his enthusiasm , he 's been prepared to look the other way when it comes to some of his country 's problems , such as a poor record on press freedom . " it 's about the players who are playing for our country , " he said .
" we all stand united behind them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's national team many togolese share tchassanti 's view .
the world cup has brought the citizens of this tiny west african country together .
the conditions that togolese journalists normally have to work under have been forgotten for the moment . " for months now , the government has been trying to show a different face , " tchassanti said .
" for 13 months now , we have n't had any problems with press freedom .
we believe the government is trying to loosen up a bit because of the world cup .
but people know that journalists ca n't write whatever they feel like . " only togolese citizens living abroad can risk criticizing the government under president faure gnassingbe - and that only via the internet .
if a journalist in the capital , lome , were to write something critical , he or she would have to reckon with severe consequences . " you could be tortured , you could be put in prison , you could be killed , " said tchassanti .
" it 's always dangerous - there 's no real press freedom in togo . " togo not alone togo is not the only world cup participant to score poorly when it comes to press freedom .
according to katrin evers from the non-governmental organization reporters without borders , other nations in the tournament , such as mexico , are also repeat offenders . " no other latin american country is more dangerous for journalists at the moment -lrb- than mexico -rrb- , " said evers .
" two journalists have already been murdered so far this year , two were murdered last year and a third disappeared without a trace over a year ago . " yaotzin botello moved to berlin from mexico city five years ago , and since then has been working as a correspondent for the respected newspaper reforma .
he appreciates the security he enjoys in his new home . " i know of a journalist who reported extensively about the brutal murders of women in ciudad juarez - he was followed and beaten , " botello said .
" you do n't know if it 's people from the government or people from the drug dealers , but in any case , someone wanted to prevent anything more from being written about the murdered women of ciudad juarez . " for 15 years now , poor young women working in the mexican city close to the united states border have been the victims of ongoing abductions and murders .
more than 400 murders have so far been documented . corruption forgotten in mexico " we do n't know what the motive is , " said botello .
" we do n't know whether it 's tied to drugs or the mafia , there are many theories .
the assumption is that the police and local politicians are in on what 's going on .
the government repeatedly says that it 's investigating , but weeks and months go by and nothing happens . " journalists who attempt to report on corruption and prostitution in mexico are stopped by a variety of means .
they ca n't rely on any official protection , botello said . " there are practically no rules for doing journalism in mexico , " he said .
" the government does n't concern itself with reporters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mexico , soccer is the number one topic at the moment , these problems are n't being addressed .
mexico is in the grip of soccer fever , with the national team playing their second preliminary match on friday . " mexico is a soccer-mad country , " botello said .
" politically , everything can be going wrong , economically too .
the president could be corrupt - all the politicians could be corrupt - but soccer is the number one topic . " even if everything is revolving around the world cup at the moment , reporters without borders is still trying to make its voice heard as it calls for greater press freedom , because without it , democracy is worth little , evers said . " for reporters without borders , it 's important that we use every situation to create awareness , especially for those countries which do n't have a free press , in which people do n't have access to unbiased information , in which they do n't have free internet access , " she said .
" in tunisia and iran , for example , certain internet sites are blocked and people are put in prison for writing critical stories , so we need to use this platform to increase political pressure on such countries to allow press freedom and release imprisoned journalists .

zidane playing in his final world cup showed brief moments of his magic in the first half but looked tired in the second . the game was played at a relatively slow pace as the players struggled to cope with the hot conditions in stuttgart .
france had the slight upper hand in the first half .
the best goal-scoring opportunity , however , fell to swiss striker alexander frei in the 24th minute but he struck over the bar from close range after a tranquillo barnetta free kick bounced through untouched to hit the french post . france came close to scoring seven minutes later when newcomer franck ribery blasted a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the box .

but french goalkeeper fabien barthez somehow managed to keep the ball out with his foot . france struggled in the second half as zidane failed to shine and henry did little up front .
top prospect ribery , who started a game for france for the first time after impressive performances as a substitute in warm-up games , showed his skill at times but did not live up to the hype . both sides will be unhappy with the fact that so many players were booked in what was a largely clean game .

zidane playing in his final world cup showed brief moments of his magic in the first half but looked tired in the second . the game was played at a relatively slow pace as the players struggled to cope with the hot conditions in stuttgart .
france had the slight upper hand in the first half .
the best goal-scoring opportunity , however , fell to swiss striker alexander frei in the 24th minute but he struck over the bar from close range after a tranquillo barnetta free kick bounced through untouched to hit the french post . france came close to scoring seven minutes later when newcomer franck ribery blasted a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the box .
and french fans cried for a penalty on 37 minutes when a thierry henry shot hit defender patrick müller 's hand . missed swiss cha n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's thierry henry -lrb- right -rrb- and switzerland 's philipp degen challenge for the ball switzerland had arguably the best chance to score after 65 minutes with a header from close range by substitute midfielder daniel gygax .
but french goalkeeper fabien barthez somehow managed to keep the ball out with his foot . france struggled in the second half as zidane failed to shine and henry did little up front .

" he said during the traditional eve of match press conference on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's magnin ludovic -lrb- right -rrb- fights for the ball with turkey 's nihat kahveci in a game in bern last november the wily silver haired 62-year old did reveal that he 'd got his team to watch tapes of the last two encounters - both draws - between the neighbors when they were paired together in the same world cup qualifier group . " i believe it 'll be pretty much the same kind of game as the last two , " kuhn said .
" the france team has only changed a little , but with one significant change and that 's thierry henry , who was n't around for the last games . " youngest team switzerland are the third youngest outfit in the competition , but kuhn dismissed fears that inexperience may play a role against world cup veterans france . " yes , my team are young , but they 're a young side that have a lot of experience playing club football at arsenal , leverkusen , lazio , " he said .
" they play alongside the greatest footballers in europe and have gained a lot of experience . " france 's secret weapon france meanwhile look set to turn to their " secret weapon " - marseille midfielder franck ribery - to inject new ideas into their attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck ribery -lrb- left -rrb- in a test game against china in france on june 7 french newspaper l 'equipe reported that ribery would replace the out-of-form david trezeguet as coach raymond domenech rips up his tactics book .
ribery , in just his fourth international appearance , would play alongside zinedine zidane and sylvain wiltord in a midfield designed to supply sole striker thierry henry , as the 1998 winners seek to bury the nightmare of their 2002 campaign when the team was knocked out during the group stage without scoring a single goal . midfield veteran claude makelele has been impressed by the young tyro . " frank is the sort of player who can bring a lot to a team in 15 or 20 minutes , " he said . zidane 's successor ? ribery only made his debut as a substitute in france 's friendly against mexico late last month and received a standing ovation from the 80,000 stade de france crowd .
the warm-up game against china last week will be remembered for djibril cisse 's broken leg , but ribery came off the bench to give the french attack new urgency and helped them to a 3-1 win . calls for ribery 's deployment also come as french soccer superstar zinedine zidane , who is 34 and plans to end his career after the world cup , is no longer seen as the team 's savior after his less than stellar performance during the preparation phase . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : switzerland after surviving a violent barrage in istanbul to beat turkey in the play-offs , facing the world 's best teams in germany will seem like a piece of cake to the swiss .

but one ngo hopes some of the focus will be on the lack of press freedom in the african nation . despite the controversy over player bonuses and the near loss of coach otto pfister , the togolese fans are over the moon about their country 's first-ever appearance at a world cup tournament .
even togolese exiles such as ali tchassanti - for years a resident of wuppertal , germany - have been caught up in the excitement .
a journalist , tchassanti has set up his own web site for the world cup , and has helped find cheap accommodation for togolese fans in germany .
in his enthusiasm , he 's been prepared to look the other way when it comes to some of his country 's problems , such as a poor record on press freedom . " it 's about the players who are playing for our country , " he said .
" we all stand united behind them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's national team many togolese share tchassanti 's view .
the world cup has brought the citizens of this tiny west african country together .
the conditions that togolese journalists normally have to work under have been forgotten for the moment . " for months now , the government has been trying to show a different face , " tchassanti said .
" for 13 months now , we have n't had any problems with press freedom .
we believe the government is trying to loosen up a bit because of the world cup .
but people know that journalists ca n't write whatever they feel like . " only togolese citizens living abroad can risk criticizing the government under president faure gnassingbe - and that only via the internet .
if a journalist in the capital , lome , were to write something critical , he or she would have to reckon with severe consequences . " you could be tortured , you could be put in prison , you could be killed , " said tchassanti .
" it 's always dangerous - there 's no real press freedom in togo . " togo not alone togo is not the only world cup participant to score poorly when it comes to press freedom .
according to katrin evers from the non-governmental organization reporters without borders , other nations in the tournament , such as mexico , are also repeat offenders . " no other latin american country is more dangerous for journalists at the moment -lrb- than mexico -rrb- , " said evers .
" two journalists have already been murdered so far this year , two were murdered last year and a third disappeared without a trace over a year ago . " yaotzin botello moved to berlin from mexico city five years ago , and since then has been working as a correspondent for the respected newspaper reforma .
he appreciates the security he enjoys in his new home . " i know of a journalist who reported extensively about the brutal murders of women in ciudad juarez - he was followed and beaten , " botello said .
" you do n't know if it 's people from the government or people from the drug dealers , but in any case , someone wanted to prevent anything more from being written about the murdered women of ciudad juarez . " for 15 years now , poor young women working in the mexican city close to the united states border have been the victims of ongoing abductions and murders .
more than 400 murders have so far been documented . corruption forgotten in mexico " we do n't know what the motive is , " said botello .
" we do n't know whether it 's tied to drugs or the mafia , there are many theories .
the assumption is that the police and local politicians are in on what 's going on .
the government repeatedly says that it 's investigating , but weeks and months go by and nothing happens . " journalists who attempt to report on corruption and prostitution in mexico are stopped by a variety of means .
they ca n't rely on any official protection , botello said . " there are practically no rules for doing journalism in mexico , " he said .
" the government does n't concern itself with reporters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mexico , soccer is the number one topic at the moment , these problems are n't being addressed .
mexico is in the grip of soccer fever , with the national team playing their second preliminary match on friday . " mexico is a soccer-mad country , " botello said .
" politically , everything can be going wrong , economically too .
the president could be corrupt - all the politicians could be corrupt - but soccer is the number one topic . " even if everything is revolving around the world cup at the moment , reporters without borders is still trying to make its voice heard as it calls for greater press freedom , because without it , democracy is worth little , evers said . " for reporters without borders , it 's important that we use every situation to create awareness , especially for those countries which do n't have a free press , in which people do n't have access to unbiased information , in which they do n't have free internet access , " she said .
" in tunisia and iran , for example , certain internet sites are blocked and people are put in prison for writing critical stories , so we need to use this platform to increase political pressure on such countries to allow press freedom and release imprisoned journalists .

or can it make employees work longer ?
amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .
the deal was seen as extremely innovative at the time .
however , pay was not lowered in lockstep with working hours , and vw 's labor costs are now 20 percent higher than its competitors ' . buyout packages offered the 2004 accords also included an agreement not to lay off workers until the end of 2011 .
but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen . " in the negotiations monday , vw suggested a three-step restructuring model , which includes improving productivity , lowering production costs , and increasing efficiency .
no further details were available .
a second round of talks is planned . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de contract extended for vw head pischetsrieder the tug of war over whether to extend the contract for the head of europe 's biggest car maker ended tuesday night with bernd pischetsrieder remaining ceo of volkswagen until april 2012 .

amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .

however , pay was not lowered in lockstep with working hours , and vw 's labor costs are now 20 percent higher than its competitors ' . buyout packages offered the 2004 accords also included an agreement not to lay off workers until the end of 2011 .
but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen .

" the states failing to use the funds correctly need to return to the straight and narrow , " said tiefensee . ahead of the meeting , several of the eastern german state premiers had called for making the terms of the solidarity pact more flexible and freeing up the funds for other purposes than those originally stipulated - a move also welcomed by klaus wowereit , mayor of cash-strapped berlin . " the list of criteria needs to be extended , " he said .
" this would solve the problem instantly . " instead , the outcome of the meeting was a decision to uphold the pact 's existing form . fierce debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the money not going where it 's most needed ?
the solidarity pact involves germans paying a surcharge of 2.5 percent on their taxes - small wonder then that the perceived waste of taxpayers ' money unleashed such fierce political debate . it recently emerged that thüringen and saxony-anhalt were intending to spend some of the solidarity pact funds on education , on the basis of it being conducive to economic growth , while , according to the finance ministry , the eastern german states spent just 39 percent of the allotted 8.5 billion euros on infrastructure in 2004 .
berlin , meanwhile , allegedly " misspent " 100 percent of its share . " we are not wasting anything , " insisted saxony-anhalt state premier wolfgang böhmer .
" even if we use it to pay teachers , police or administration costs , this does not amount to waste . " ailing economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been told to clean up its act thriving regions are still few and far between in the former communist east .
unemployment remains stubbornly high with about 20 percent - which is almost twice as high as in the more well-to-do western germany . only in the state of saxony , home to a number of old and new economy enterprises , is a self-sustaining economy within reach , and state premier georg milbradt angered his eastern colleagues by rejecting demands for a relaxation of the rules governing the funds . " i think the other eastern states are wrong in assuming the funds can be used more efficiently for purposes other than investments , " he said .
" expenditure on things like better education will also have to be financed once the transfers will have ceased in the future . " people not concrete but the leaders of four of the five regional states have said it 's better to invest in people rather than concrete , and that rebuilding the east is seen merely as a matter of urban planning . " we have enough asphalted paths through our forests and enough theme parks , " said thüringen 's finance minister birgit diezel .

" swiss coach kobi kuhn said monday he 's got a secret recipe to spike 1998 world cup winners france when they meet on tuesday in their opening world cup tie . " it 's up to us to come up with the recipe , but you do n't think i 'm going to divulge it in front of all of you do you ? " he said during the traditional eve of match press conference on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's magnin ludovic -lrb- right -rrb- fights for the ball with turkey 's nihat kahveci in a game in bern last november the wily silver haired 62-year old did reveal that he 'd got his team to watch tapes of the last two encounters - both draws - between the neighbors when they were paired together in the same world cup qualifier group . " i believe it 'll be pretty much the same kind of game as the last two , " kuhn said .
" the france team has only changed a little , but with one significant change and that 's thierry henry , who was n't around for the last games . " youngest team switzerland are the third youngest outfit in the competition , but kuhn dismissed fears that inexperience may play a role against world cup veterans france . " yes , my team are young , but they 're a young side that have a lot of experience playing club football at arsenal , leverkusen , lazio , " he said .
" they play alongside the greatest footballers in europe and have gained a lot of experience . " france 's secret weapon france meanwhile look set to turn to their " secret weapon " - marseille midfielder franck ribery - to inject new ideas into their attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck ribery -lrb- left -rrb- in a test game against china in france on june 7 french newspaper l 'equipe reported that ribery would replace the out-of-form david trezeguet as coach raymond domenech rips up his tactics book .
ribery , in just his fourth international appearance , would play alongside zinedine zidane and sylvain wiltord in a midfield designed to supply sole striker thierry henry , as the 1998 winners seek to bury the nightmare of their 2002 campaign when the team was knocked out during the group stage without scoring a single goal . midfield veteran claude makelele has been impressed by the young tyro . " frank is the sort of player who can bring a lot to a team in 15 or 20 minutes , " he said . zidane 's successor ? ribery only made his debut as a substitute in france 's friendly against mexico late last month and received a standing ovation from the 80,000 stade de france crowd .
the warm-up game against china last week will be remembered for djibril cisse 's broken leg , but ribery came off the bench to give the french attack new urgency and helped them to a 3-1 win . calls for ribery 's deployment also come as french soccer superstar zinedine zidane , who is 34 and plans to end his career after the world cup , is no longer seen as the team 's savior after his less than stellar performance during the preparation phase . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : switzerland after surviving a violent barrage in istanbul to beat turkey in the play-offs , facing the world 's best teams in germany will seem like a piece of cake to the swiss .

but one ngo hopes some of the focus will be on the lack of press freedom in the african nation . despite the controversy over player bonuses and the near loss of coach otto pfister , the togolese fans are over the moon about their country 's first-ever appearance at a world cup tournament .
even togolese exiles such as ali tchassanti - for years a resident of wuppertal , germany - have been caught up in the excitement .
a journalist , tchassanti has set up his own web site for the world cup , and has helped find cheap accommodation for togolese fans in germany .
in his enthusiasm , he 's been prepared to look the other way when it comes to some of his country 's problems , such as a poor record on press freedom . " it 's about the players who are playing for our country , " he said .
" we all stand united behind them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's national team many togolese share tchassanti 's view .
the world cup has brought the citizens of this tiny west african country together .
the conditions that togolese journalists normally have to work under have been forgotten for the moment . " for months now , the government has been trying to show a different face , " tchassanti said .
" for 13 months now , we have n't had any problems with press freedom .
we believe the government is trying to loosen up a bit because of the world cup .
but people know that journalists ca n't write whatever they feel like . " only togolese citizens living abroad can risk criticizing the government under president faure gnassingbe - and that only via the internet .
if a journalist in the capital , lome , were to write something critical , he or she would have to reckon with severe consequences . " you could be tortured , you could be put in prison , you could be killed , " said tchassanti .
" it 's always dangerous - there 's no real press freedom in togo . " togo not alone togo is not the only world cup participant to score poorly when it comes to press freedom .
according to katrin evers from the non-governmental organization reporters without borders , other nations in the tournament , such as mexico , are also repeat offenders . " no other latin american country is more dangerous for journalists at the moment -lrb- than mexico -rrb- , " said evers .
" two journalists have already been murdered so far this year , two were murdered last year and a third disappeared without a trace over a year ago . " yaotzin botello moved to berlin from mexico city five years ago , and since then has been working as a correspondent for the respected newspaper reforma .
he appreciates the security he enjoys in his new home . " i know of a journalist who reported extensively about the brutal murders of women in ciudad juarez - he was followed and beaten , " botello said .
" you do n't know if it 's people from the government or people from the drug dealers , but in any case , someone wanted to prevent anything more from being written about the murdered women of ciudad juarez . " for 15 years now , poor young women working in the mexican city close to the united states border have been the victims of ongoing abductions and murders .
more than 400 murders have so far been documented . corruption forgotten in mexico " we do n't know what the motive is , " said botello .
" we do n't know whether it 's tied to drugs or the mafia , there are many theories .
the assumption is that the police and local politicians are in on what 's going on .
the government repeatedly says that it 's investigating , but weeks and months go by and nothing happens . " journalists who attempt to report on corruption and prostitution in mexico are stopped by a variety of means .
they ca n't rely on any official protection , botello said . " there are practically no rules for doing journalism in mexico , " he said .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .
most of the other team members are inexperienced though , and play in lower divisions of the european leagues . togo 's loyal german fans but no matter what happens , the team will be able to rely on a dedicated group of fans that have gathered in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven klein -lrb- right -rrb- and fellow togo fan kossi aziabou " the outcome of the match against korea will be crucial , " said sven klein , co-founder of the german-togolese soccer fan club , which now claims to have over 1,000 members .
" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .
though the african nation lost the 2-1 match , its single goal against heavyweight argentina , was a triumph in the " group of death " that also includes serbia and montenegro and the netherlands . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german sparrow hawks flock to team togo when kossi aziabou and sven klein founded the german-togolese soccer fan club , they expected to be cheering for togo with a few friends at home .

zidane playing in his final world cup showed brief moments of his magic in the first half but looked tired in the second . the game was played at a relatively slow pace as the players struggled to cope with the hot conditions in stuttgart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.06.2006 vw presses for increased work week at same pay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are vw 's hands tied by tariff agreements ?
or can it make employees work longer ?
amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .
the deal was seen as extremely innovative at the time .

" swiss coach kobi kuhn said monday he 's got a secret recipe to spike 1998 world cup winners france when they meet on tuesday in their opening world cup tie . " it 's up to us to come up with the recipe , but you do n't think i 'm going to divulge it in front of all of you do you ? " he said during the traditional eve of match press conference on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's magnin ludovic -lrb- right -rrb- fights for the ball with turkey 's nihat kahveci in a game in bern last november the wily silver haired 62-year old did reveal that he 'd got his team to watch tapes of the last two encounters - both draws - between the neighbors when they were paired together in the same world cup qualifier group . " i believe it 'll be pretty much the same kind of game as the last two , " kuhn said .
" the france team has only changed a little , but with one significant change and that 's thierry henry , who was n't around for the last games . " youngest team switzerland are the third youngest outfit in the competition , but kuhn dismissed fears that inexperience may play a role against world cup veterans france . " yes , my team are young , but they 're a young side that have a lot of experience playing club football at arsenal , leverkusen , lazio , " he said .
" they play alongside the greatest footballers in europe and have gained a lot of experience . " france 's secret weapon france meanwhile look set to turn to their " secret weapon " - marseille midfielder franck ribery - to inject new ideas into their attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck ribery -lrb- left -rrb- in a test game against china in france on june 7 french newspaper l 'equipe reported that ribery would replace the out-of-form david trezeguet as coach raymond domenech rips up his tactics book .
ribery , in just his fourth international appearance , would play alongside zinedine zidane and sylvain wiltord in a midfield designed to supply sole striker thierry henry , as the 1998 winners seek to bury the nightmare of their 2002 campaign when the team was knocked out during the group stage without scoring a single goal . midfield veteran claude makelele has been impressed by the young tyro . " frank is the sort of player who can bring a lot to a team in 15 or 20 minutes , " he said . zidane 's successor ? ribery only made his debut as a substitute in france 's friendly against mexico late last month and received a standing ovation from the 80,000 stade de france crowd .
the warm-up game against china last week will be remembered for djibril cisse 's broken leg , but ribery came off the bench to give the french attack new urgency and helped them to a 3-1 win . calls for ribery 's deployment also come as french soccer superstar zinedine zidane , who is 34 and plans to end his career after the world cup , is no longer seen as the team 's savior after his less than stellar performance during the preparation phase . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : switzerland after surviving a violent barrage in istanbul to beat turkey in the play-offs , facing the world 's best teams in germany will seem like a piece of cake to the swiss .

" yes , my team are young , but they 're a young side that have a lot of experience playing club football at arsenal , leverkusen , lazio , " he said .
" they play alongside the greatest footballers in europe and have gained a lot of experience . " france 's secret weapon france meanwhile look set to turn to their " secret weapon " - marseille midfielder franck ribery - to inject new ideas into their attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck ribery -lrb- left -rrb- in a test game against china in france on june 7 french newspaper l 'equipe reported that ribery would replace the out-of-form david trezeguet as coach raymond domenech rips up his tactics book .
ribery , in just his fourth international appearance , would play alongside zinedine zidane and sylvain wiltord in a midfield designed to supply sole striker thierry henry , as the 1998 winners seek to bury the nightmare of their 2002 campaign when the team was knocked out during the group stage without scoring a single goal . midfield veteran claude makelele has been impressed by the young tyro . " frank is the sort of player who can bring a lot to a team in 15 or 20 minutes , " he said . zidane 's successor ? ribery only made his debut as a substitute in france 's friendly against mexico late last month and received a standing ovation from the 80,000 stade de france crowd .
the warm-up game against china last week will be remembered for djibril cisse 's broken leg , but ribery came off the bench to give the french attack new urgency and helped them to a 3-1 win . calls for ribery 's deployment also come as french soccer superstar zinedine zidane , who is 34 and plans to end his career after the world cup , is no longer seen as the team 's savior after his less than stellar performance during the preparation phase . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : switzerland after surviving a violent barrage in istanbul to beat turkey in the play-offs , facing the world 's best teams in germany will seem like a piece of cake to the swiss .

" the list of criteria needs to be extended , " he said .
" this would solve the problem instantly . " instead , the outcome of the meeting was a decision to uphold the pact 's existing form . fierce debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the money not going where it 's most needed ?
the solidarity pact involves germans paying a surcharge of 2.5 percent on their taxes - small wonder then that the perceived waste of taxpayers ' money unleashed such fierce political debate . it recently emerged that thüringen and saxony-anhalt were intending to spend some of the solidarity pact funds on education , on the basis of it being conducive to economic growth , while , according to the finance ministry , the eastern german states spent just 39 percent of the allotted 8.5 billion euros on infrastructure in 2004 .
berlin , meanwhile , allegedly " misspent " 100 percent of its share . " we are not wasting anything , " insisted saxony-anhalt state premier wolfgang böhmer .
" even if we use it to pay teachers , police or administration costs , this does not amount to waste . " ailing economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been told to clean up its act thriving regions are still few and far between in the former communist east .
unemployment remains stubbornly high with about 20 percent - which is almost twice as high as in the more well-to-do western germany . only in the state of saxony , home to a number of old and new economy enterprises , is a self-sustaining economy within reach , and state premier georg milbradt angered his eastern colleagues by rejecting demands for a relaxation of the rules governing the funds . " i think the other eastern states are wrong in assuming the funds can be used more efficiently for purposes other than investments , " he said .
" expenditure on things like better education will also have to be financed once the transfers will have ceased in the future . " people not concrete but the leaders of four of the five regional states have said it 's better to invest in people rather than concrete , and that rebuilding the east is seen merely as a matter of urban planning . " we have enough asphalted paths through our forests and enough theme parks , " said thüringen 's finance minister birgit diezel .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .
most of the other team members are inexperienced though , and play in lower divisions of the european leagues . togo 's loyal german fans but no matter what happens , the team will be able to rely on a dedicated group of fans that have gathered in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven klein -lrb- right -rrb- and fellow togo fan kossi aziabou " the outcome of the match against korea will be crucial , " said sven klein , co-founder of the german-togolese soccer fan club , which now claims to have over 1,000 members .
" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .
most of the other team members are inexperienced though , and play in lower divisions of the european leagues . togo 's loyal german fans but no matter what happens , the team will be able to rely on a dedicated group of fans that have gathered in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven klein -lrb- right -rrb- and fellow togo fan kossi aziabou " the outcome of the match against korea will be crucial , " said sven klein , co-founder of the german-togolese soccer fan club , which now claims to have over 1,000 members .
" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .

zidane playing in his final world cup showed brief moments of his magic in the first half but looked tired in the second . the game was played at a relatively slow pace as the players struggled to cope with the hot conditions in stuttgart .
france had the slight upper hand in the first half .
the best goal-scoring opportunity , however , fell to swiss striker alexander frei in the 24th minute but he struck over the bar from close range after a tranquillo barnetta free kick bounced through untouched to hit the french post . france came close to scoring seven minutes later when newcomer franck ribery blasted a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the box .

but french goalkeeper fabien barthez somehow managed to keep the ball out with his foot . france struggled in the second half as zidane failed to shine and henry did little up front .
top prospect ribery , who started a game for france for the first time after impressive performances as a substitute in warm-up games , showed his skill at times but did not live up to the hype . both sides will be unhappy with the fact that so many players were booked in what was a largely clean game .
switzerland picked up 5 yellow cards and france 3 . all in all switzerland and france will probably be satisfied to have picked up a point but france will have to improve greatly if they are to have a chance at winning their second world cup title . dw staff -lrb- jas -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 dw-world.de 's complete coverage of the 2006 world cup .

a dispute over financial rewards has tainted the image of togo 's soccer team and nearly led to the resignation of its german coach .
some accuse players of being greedy , but others say that they 're simply acting wisely . the chances for togo in the world cup have been rated as extremely slim , but the mere fact that this tiny sliver of a nation , a former french colony wedged between ghana and benin in western africa , has even qualified for the world cup is reason to cheer .
in its first world cup appearance ever , togo 's eperviers , or hawks , will be pitted against south korea on tuesday in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo trainer otto pfister , who quit last friday and returned late monday as if being the clear underdog in a group that also includes france and switzerland were not discouraging enough , the eperviers temporarily lost their german coach at the eleventh hour when otto pfister walked out last friday in a heated dispute with the togo soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- over payments and bonuses for the players , who had boycotted training sessions in protest . pfister , 68 , who has spent decades training national teams across africa and had led the saudi arabian team through the final qualifying rounds at the 1998 world cup in france , announced his surprise comeback late monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winfried schäfer " the resignation was a principled decision , " pfister 's son and advisor , mike , said in an interview with reporters for the official fifa web site .
" the return is a matter of the heart . " during the void over the weekend , the togolese soccer federation -lrb- ftf -rrb- entered into discussions with another german trainer with ties to africa , winfried schäfer , who was the cameroon coach for the 2002 world cup .
schäfer had given the ftf an ultimatum , agreeing to come on board only on the condition that the pay grievances be solved . greedy players ? the players have demanded 155,000 euros -lrb- $ 196,200 -rrb- to play in the world cup , with a bonus of 30,000 each per win and 15,000 euros for a draw , according reuters .
togo 's sports minister , agouta ouyenga , who was here in germany for the games , told a radio station back home that a compromise had not been reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a school class in togo the demands did n't sit well with togolese , who - on average - have an annual income of barely $ 1,700 .
critics of the team 's demands say the players are too greedy .
the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .

the honor of playing for one 's national team in the greatest sporting event on earth should be enough . but others have identified different culprits . " pride in playing for one 's national team is one thing , but these are professional players , who need to be fairly paid , " said harald ganns , a high-ranking german diplomat , who spent nearly 20 years serving in several african nations , including togo , and moonlighted as assistant coach to the national team in lome back in the 1960s . disputes over financial compensation not unusual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : players want to make sure the money does n't disappear " the problem lies not with the players , but with soccer federations and agents , " he added .
" pay disputes are nothing unusual in africa .
when it comes to money changing hands , there is no control over the finances .
the money disappears , and the players even wind up not getting paid at all , so guarantees need to be spelled out before the ball gets rolling . " but ganns also said that the acute poverty faced by many african nations is a problem . " the stadiums are way underdeveloped and youth teams even have difficulty in acquiring enough balls , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nation pinning its hopes on star striker emmanuel adebayor still , world class african teams , such as cameroon and senegal , which have made it to the quarter-finals in previous world cups , have emerged in the past few decades . the togo team will be relying on its star striker , emmanuel adebayor , who plays for london 's fc arsenal .

" we stand 100 percent behind togo , whatever happens . " the fans are drawing on the inspiration from the ivory coast-argentina match last saturday .

the best goal-scoring opportunity , however , fell to swiss striker alexander frei in the 24th minute but he struck over the bar from close range after a tranquillo barnetta free kick bounced through untouched to hit the french post . france came close to scoring seven minutes later when newcomer franck ribery blasted a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the box .
and french fans cried for a penalty on 37 minutes when a thierry henry shot hit defender patrick müller 's hand . missed swiss cha n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's thierry henry -lrb- right -rrb- and switzerland 's philipp degen challenge for the ball switzerland had arguably the best chance to score after 65 minutes with a header from close range by substitute midfielder daniel gygax .
but french goalkeeper fabien barthez somehow managed to keep the ball out with his foot . france struggled in the second half as zidane failed to shine and henry did little up front .
top prospect ribery , who started a game for france for the first time after impressive performances as a substitute in warm-up games , showed his skill at times but did not live up to the hype . both sides will be unhappy with the fact that so many players were booked in what was a largely clean game .
switzerland picked up 5 yellow cards and france 3 . all in all switzerland and france will probably be satisfied to have picked up a point but france will have to improve greatly if they are to have a chance at winning their second world cup title . dw staff -lrb- jas -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 dw-world.de 's complete coverage of the 2006 world cup .

amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .
the deal was seen as extremely innovative at the time .
however , pay was not lowered in lockstep with working hours , and vw 's labor costs are now 20 percent higher than its competitors ' . buyout packages offered the 2004 accords also included an agreement not to lay off workers until the end of 2011 .
but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen .

but one ngo hopes some of the focus will be on the lack of press freedom in the african nation . despite the controversy over player bonuses and the near loss of coach otto pfister , the togolese fans are over the moon about their country 's first-ever appearance at a world cup tournament .
even togolese exiles such as ali tchassanti - for years a resident of wuppertal , germany - have been caught up in the excitement .
a journalist , tchassanti has set up his own web site for the world cup , and has helped find cheap accommodation for togolese fans in germany .
in his enthusiasm , he 's been prepared to look the other way when it comes to some of his country 's problems , such as a poor record on press freedom . " it 's about the players who are playing for our country , " he said .
" we all stand united behind them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's national team many togolese share tchassanti 's view .
the world cup has brought the citizens of this tiny west african country together .
the conditions that togolese journalists normally have to work under have been forgotten for the moment . " for months now , the government has been trying to show a different face , " tchassanti said .
" for 13 months now , we have n't had any problems with press freedom .
we believe the government is trying to loosen up a bit because of the world cup .
but people know that journalists ca n't write whatever they feel like . " only togolese citizens living abroad can risk criticizing the government under president faure gnassingbe - and that only via the internet .
if a journalist in the capital , lome , were to write something critical , he or she would have to reckon with severe consequences . " you could be tortured , you could be put in prison , you could be killed , " said tchassanti .
" it 's always dangerous - there 's no real press freedom in togo . " togo not alone togo is not the only world cup participant to score poorly when it comes to press freedom .
according to katrin evers from the non-governmental organization reporters without borders , other nations in the tournament , such as mexico , are also repeat offenders . " no other latin american country is more dangerous for journalists at the moment -lrb- than mexico -rrb- , " said evers .
" two journalists have already been murdered so far this year , two were murdered last year and a third disappeared without a trace over a year ago . " yaotzin botello moved to berlin from mexico city five years ago , and since then has been working as a correspondent for the respected newspaper reforma .
he appreciates the security he enjoys in his new home . " i know of a journalist who reported extensively about the brutal murders of women in ciudad juarez - he was followed and beaten , " botello said .
" you do n't know if it 's people from the government or people from the drug dealers , but in any case , someone wanted to prevent anything more from being written about the murdered women of ciudad juarez . " for 15 years now , poor young women working in the mexican city close to the united states border have been the victims of ongoing abductions and murders .
more than 400 murders have so far been documented . corruption forgotten in mexico " we do n't know what the motive is , " said botello .
" we do n't know whether it 's tied to drugs or the mafia , there are many theories .
the assumption is that the police and local politicians are in on what 's going on .
the government repeatedly says that it 's investigating , but weeks and months go by and nothing happens . " journalists who attempt to report on corruption and prostitution in mexico are stopped by a variety of means .
they ca n't rely on any official protection , botello said . " there are practically no rules for doing journalism in mexico , " he said .
" the government does n't concern itself with reporters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mexico , soccer is the number one topic at the moment , these problems are n't being addressed .
mexico is in the grip of soccer fever , with the national team playing their second preliminary match on friday . " mexico is a soccer-mad country , " botello said .
" politically , everything can be going wrong , economically too .
the president could be corrupt - all the politicians could be corrupt - but soccer is the number one topic . " even if everything is revolving around the world cup at the moment , reporters without borders is still trying to make its voice heard as it calls for greater press freedom , because without it , democracy is worth little , evers said . " for reporters without borders , it 's important that we use every situation to create awareness , especially for those countries which do n't have a free press , in which people do n't have access to unbiased information , in which they do n't have free internet access , " she said .
" in tunisia and iran , for example , certain internet sites are blocked and people are put in prison for writing critical stories , so we need to use this platform to increase political pressure on such countries to allow press freedom and release imprisoned journalists .

switzerland will be happy with the result knowing that they have a great chance of finishing top of the group .
the one thing both sides will definitely be unhappy about is the trigger-happy russian referee that branded 8 yellow cards , 5 for switzerland and 3 for france in what was basically a pretty clean and fair game . dw staff -lrb- jas -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

all in all the game was disappointing after a promising first half .
zinedine zidane lacked bite in the second forty five minutes after impressing in the first half .
both teams may be happy with the point but the french press is sure to ask questions after france play another world cup game without scoring a goal .
switzerland will be happy with the result knowing that they have a great chance of finishing top of the group .
the one thing both sides will definitely be unhappy about is the trigger-happy russian referee that branded 8 yellow cards , 5 for switzerland and 3 for france in what was basically a pretty clean and fair game . dw staff -lrb- jas -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

zidane playing in his final world cup showed brief moments of his magic in the first half but looked tired in the second . the game was played at a relatively slow pace as the players struggled to cope with the hot conditions in stuttgart .

switzerland will be happy with the result knowing that they have a great chance of finishing top of the group .

amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .

but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen .

or can it make employees work longer ?
amid massive financial problems , volkswagen said it aims to get more bang for its euro by boosting the work week to 35 hours in six german factories . " we plan to return to a 35-hour work week , " vw personnel chief horst neumann told reporters following exploratory talks with the ig metall trade union on monday in hanover . extending the work week from the current 28.8 hours to 35 without concomitant pay increases essentially amounts to a 20 percent pay reduction for workers . chief ig metall negotiator hartmut meine rejected the suggestion , telling reporters : " there will be no tariff discussions with volkswagen , " and asked how the company planned to square its current surplus of workers with a longer work week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automaker has 20 percent higher labor costs than the competition " right now we do n't have enough work to keep all employees busy with a 28.8 hour week , " meine said . volkswagen 's four day , 28.8 hour week was part of a tariff deal struck in 2004 that aimed to save 30,000 jobs at the six western german plants .
the deal was seen as extremely innovative at the time .
however , pay was not lowered in lockstep with working hours , and vw 's labor costs are now 20 percent higher than its competitors ' . buyout packages offered the 2004 accords also included an agreement not to lay off workers until the end of 2011 .
but in the wake of the ig metall talks , neumann affirmed the management board 's position that the company needs to severely cut back on personnel .
he said it would be " very , very difficult " to retain all 100,000 jobs currently held in the six factories in question ; up to 20,000 jobs could eventually be cut . recently , the concern began offering its workers sweetened buyouts and early retirement deals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers are currently covered under a deal that protects jobs through 2011 neumann said it would be ideal if the proposal for a longer work week simply went through on the first try , but added , " that wo n't happen . " in the negotiations monday , vw suggested a three-step restructuring model , which includes improving productivity , lowering production costs , and increasing efficiency .
no further details were available .

but one ngo hopes some of the focus will be on the lack of press freedom in the african nation . despite the controversy over player bonuses and the near loss of coach otto pfister , the togolese fans are over the moon about their country 's first-ever appearance at a world cup tournament .
even togolese exiles such as ali tchassanti - for years a resident of wuppertal , germany - have been caught up in the excitement .
a journalist , tchassanti has set up his own web site for the world cup , and has helped find cheap accommodation for togolese fans in germany .
in his enthusiasm , he 's been prepared to look the other way when it comes to some of his country 's problems , such as a poor record on press freedom . " it 's about the players who are playing for our country , " he said .
" we all stand united behind them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's national team many togolese share tchassanti 's view .
the world cup has brought the citizens of this tiny west african country together .
the conditions that togolese journalists normally have to work under have been forgotten for the moment . " for months now , the government has been trying to show a different face , " tchassanti said .
" for 13 months now , we have n't had any problems with press freedom .
we believe the government is trying to loosen up a bit because of the world cup .
but people know that journalists ca n't write whatever they feel like . " only togolese citizens living abroad can risk criticizing the government under president faure gnassingbe - and that only via the internet .
if a journalist in the capital , lome , were to write something critical , he or she would have to reckon with severe consequences . " you could be tortured , you could be put in prison , you could be killed , " said tchassanti .
" it 's always dangerous - there 's no real press freedom in togo . " togo not alone togo is not the only world cup participant to score poorly when it comes to press freedom .
according to katrin evers from the non-governmental organization reporters without borders , other nations in the tournament , such as mexico , are also repeat offenders . " no other latin american country is more dangerous for journalists at the moment -lrb- than mexico -rrb- , " said evers .
" two journalists have already been murdered so far this year , two were murdered last year and a third disappeared without a trace over a year ago . " yaotzin botello moved to berlin from mexico city five years ago , and since then has been working as a correspondent for the respected newspaper reforma .
he appreciates the security he enjoys in his new home . " i know of a journalist who reported extensively about the brutal murders of women in ciudad juarez - he was followed and beaten , " botello said .
" you do n't know if it 's people from the government or people from the drug dealers , but in any case , someone wanted to prevent anything more from being written about the murdered women of ciudad juarez . " for 15 years now , poor young women working in the mexican city close to the united states border have been the victims of ongoing abductions and murders .
more than 400 murders have so far been documented . corruption forgotten in mexico " we do n't know what the motive is , " said botello .
" we do n't know whether it 's tied to drugs or the mafia , there are many theories .
the assumption is that the police and local politicians are in on what 's going on .
the government repeatedly says that it 's investigating , but weeks and months go by and nothing happens . " journalists who attempt to report on corruption and prostitution in mexico are stopped by a variety of means .
they ca n't rely on any official protection , botello said . " there are practically no rules for doing journalism in mexico , " he said .
" the government does n't concern itself with reporters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mexico , soccer is the number one topic at the moment , these problems are n't being addressed .
mexico is in the grip of soccer fever , with the national team playing their second preliminary match on friday . " mexico is a soccer-mad country , " botello said .
" politically , everything can be going wrong , economically too .
the president could be corrupt - all the politicians could be corrupt - but soccer is the number one topic . " even if everything is revolving around the world cup at the moment , reporters without borders is still trying to make its voice heard as it calls for greater press freedom , because without it , democracy is worth little , evers said . " for reporters without borders , it 's important that we use every situation to create awareness , especially for those countries which do n't have a free press , in which people do n't have access to unbiased information , in which they do n't have free internet access , " she said .
" in tunisia and iran , for example , certain internet sites are blocked and people are put in prison for writing critical stories , so we need to use this platform to increase political pressure on such countries to allow press freedom and release imprisoned journalists .

but one ngo hopes some of the focus will be on the lack of press freedom in the african nation . despite the controversy over player bonuses and the near loss of coach otto pfister , the togolese fans are over the moon about their country 's first-ever appearance at a world cup tournament .
even togolese exiles such as ali tchassanti - for years a resident of wuppertal , germany - have been caught up in the excitement .
a journalist , tchassanti has set up his own web site for the world cup , and has helped find cheap accommodation for togolese fans in germany .
in his enthusiasm , he 's been prepared to look the other way when it comes to some of his country 's problems , such as a poor record on press freedom . " it 's about the players who are playing for our country , " he said .
" we all stand united behind them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's national team many togolese share tchassanti 's view .
the world cup has brought the citizens of this tiny west african country together .
the conditions that togolese journalists normally have to work under have been forgotten for the moment . " for months now , the government has been trying to show a different face , " tchassanti said .
" for 13 months now , we have n't had any problems with press freedom .
we believe the government is trying to loosen up a bit because of the world cup .
but people know that journalists ca n't write whatever they feel like . " only togolese citizens living abroad can risk criticizing the government under president faure gnassingbe - and that only via the internet .
if a journalist in the capital , lome , were to write something critical , he or she would have to reckon with severe consequences . " you could be tortured , you could be put in prison , you could be killed , " said tchassanti .
" it 's always dangerous - there 's no real press freedom in togo . " togo not alone togo is not the only world cup participant to score poorly when it comes to press freedom .
according to katrin evers from the non-governmental organization reporters without borders , other nations in the tournament , such as mexico , are also repeat offenders . " no other latin american country is more dangerous for journalists at the moment -lrb- than mexico -rrb- , " said evers .
" two journalists have already been murdered so far this year , two were murdered last year and a third disappeared without a trace over a year ago . " yaotzin botello moved to berlin from mexico city five years ago , and since then has been working as a correspondent for the respected newspaper reforma .
he appreciates the security he enjoys in his new home . " i know of a journalist who reported extensively about the brutal murders of women in ciudad juarez - he was followed and beaten , " botello said .
" you do n't know if it 's people from the government or people from the drug dealers , but in any case , someone wanted to prevent anything more from being written about the murdered women of ciudad juarez . " for 15 years now , poor young women working in the mexican city close to the united states border have been the victims of ongoing abductions and murders .
more than 400 murders have so far been documented . corruption forgotten in mexico " we do n't know what the motive is , " said botello .
" we do n't know whether it 's tied to drugs or the mafia , there are many theories .
the assumption is that the police and local politicians are in on what 's going on .
the government repeatedly says that it 's investigating , but weeks and months go by and nothing happens . " journalists who attempt to report on corruption and prostitution in mexico are stopped by a variety of means .
they ca n't rely on any official protection , botello said . " there are practically no rules for doing journalism in mexico , " he said .
" the government does n't concern itself with reporters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mexico , soccer is the number one topic at the moment , these problems are n't being addressed .
mexico is in the grip of soccer fever , with the national team playing their second preliminary match on friday . " mexico is a soccer-mad country , " botello said .
" politically , everything can be going wrong , economically too .
the president could be corrupt - all the politicians could be corrupt - but soccer is the number one topic . " even if everything is revolving around the world cup at the moment , reporters without borders is still trying to make its voice heard as it calls for greater press freedom , because without it , democracy is worth little , evers said . " for reporters without borders , it 's important that we use every situation to create awareness , especially for those countries which do n't have a free press , in which people do n't have access to unbiased information , in which they do n't have free internet access , " she said .
" in tunisia and iran , for example , certain internet sites are blocked and people are put in prison for writing critical stories , so we need to use this platform to increase political pressure on such countries to allow press freedom and release imprisoned journalists .

zidane playing in his final world cup showed brief moments of his magic in the first half but looked tired in the second . the game was played at a relatively slow pace as the players struggled to cope with the hot conditions in stuttgart .
france had the slight upper hand in the first half .
the best goal-scoring opportunity , however , fell to swiss striker alexander frei in the 24th minute but he struck over the bar from close range after a tranquillo barnetta free kick bounced through untouched to hit the french post . france came close to scoring seven minutes later when newcomer franck ribery blasted a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the box .

but french goalkeeper fabien barthez somehow managed to keep the ball out with his foot . france struggled in the second half as zidane failed to shine and henry did little up front .
top prospect ribery , who started a game for france for the first time after impressive performances as a substitute in warm-up games , showed his skill at times but did not live up to the hype . both sides will be unhappy with the fact that so many players were booked in what was a largely clean game .
switzerland picked up 5 yellow cards and france 3 . all in all switzerland and france will probably be satisfied to have picked up a point but france will have to improve greatly if they are to have a chance at winning their second world cup title . dw staff -lrb- jas -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 dw-world.de 's complete coverage of the 2006 world cup .

" swiss coach kobi kuhn said monday he 's got a secret recipe to spike 1998 world cup winners france when they meet on tuesday in their opening world cup tie . " it 's up to us to come up with the recipe , but you do n't think i 'm going to divulge it in front of all of you do you ? " he said during the traditional eve of match press conference on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's magnin ludovic -lrb- right -rrb- fights for the ball with turkey 's nihat kahveci in a game in bern last november the wily silver haired 62-year old did reveal that he 'd got his team to watch tapes of the last two encounters - both draws - between the neighbors when they were paired together in the same world cup qualifier group . " i believe it 'll be pretty much the same kind of game as the last two , " kuhn said .
" the france team has only changed a little , but with one significant change and that 's thierry henry , who was n't around for the last games . " youngest team switzerland are the third youngest outfit in the competition , but kuhn dismissed fears that inexperience may play a role against world cup veterans france . " yes , my team are young , but they 're a young side that have a lot of experience playing club football at arsenal , leverkusen , lazio , " he said .
" they play alongside the greatest footballers in europe and have gained a lot of experience . " france 's secret weapon france meanwhile look set to turn to their " secret weapon " - marseille midfielder franck ribery - to inject new ideas into their attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck ribery -lrb- left -rrb- in a test game against china in france on june 7 french newspaper l 'equipe reported that ribery would replace the out-of-form david trezeguet as coach raymond domenech rips up his tactics book .
ribery , in just his fourth international appearance , would play alongside zinedine zidane and sylvain wiltord in a midfield designed to supply sole striker thierry henry , as the 1998 winners seek to bury the nightmare of their 2002 campaign when the team was knocked out during the group stage without scoring a single goal . midfield veteran claude makelele has been impressed by the young tyro . " frank is the sort of player who can bring a lot to a team in 15 or 20 minutes , " he said . zidane 's successor ? ribery only made his debut as a substitute in france 's friendly against mexico late last month and received a standing ovation from the 80,000 stade de france crowd .
the warm-up game against china last week will be remembered for djibril cisse 's broken leg , but ribery came off the bench to give the french attack new urgency and helped them to a 3-1 win . calls for ribery 's deployment also come as french soccer superstar zinedine zidane , who is 34 and plans to end his career after the world cup , is no longer seen as the team 's savior after his less than stellar performance during the preparation phase . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : switzerland after surviving a violent barrage in istanbul to beat turkey in the play-offs , facing the world 's best teams in germany will seem like a piece of cake to the swiss .

" youngest team switzerland are the third youngest outfit in the competition , but kuhn dismissed fears that inexperience may play a role against world cup veterans france . " yes , my team are young , but they 're a young side that have a lot of experience playing club football at arsenal , leverkusen , lazio , " he said .
" they play alongside the greatest footballers in europe and have gained a lot of experience . " france 's secret weapon france meanwhile look set to turn to their " secret weapon " - marseille midfielder franck ribery - to inject new ideas into their attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck ribery -lrb- left -rrb- in a test game against china in france on june 7 french newspaper l 'equipe reported that ribery would replace the out-of-form david trezeguet as coach raymond domenech rips up his tactics book .
ribery , in just his fourth international appearance , would play alongside zinedine zidane and sylvain wiltord in a midfield designed to supply sole striker thierry henry , as the 1998 winners seek to bury the nightmare of their 2002 campaign when the team was knocked out during the group stage without scoring a single goal . midfield veteran claude makelele has been impressed by the young tyro . " frank is the sort of player who can bring a lot to a team in 15 or 20 minutes , " he said . zidane 's successor ? ribery only made his debut as a substitute in france 's friendly against mexico late last month and received a standing ovation from the 80,000 stade de france crowd .
the warm-up game against china last week will be remembered for djibril cisse 's broken leg , but ribery came off the bench to give the french attack new urgency and helped them to a 3-1 win . calls for ribery 's deployment also come as french soccer superstar zinedine zidane , who is 34 and plans to end his career after the world cup , is no longer seen as the team 's savior after his less than stellar performance during the preparation phase . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup team checks : switzerland after surviving a violent barrage in istanbul to beat turkey in the play-offs , facing the world 's best teams in germany will seem like a piece of cake to the swiss .

" the states failing to use the funds correctly need to return to the straight and narrow , " said tiefensee . ahead of the meeting , several of the eastern german state premiers had called for making the terms of the solidarity pact more flexible and freeing up the funds for other purposes than those originally stipulated - a move also welcomed by klaus wowereit , mayor of cash-strapped berlin . " the list of criteria needs to be extended , " he said .
" this would solve the problem instantly . " instead , the outcome of the meeting was a decision to uphold the pact 's existing form . fierce debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the money not going where it 's most needed ?
the solidarity pact involves germans paying a surcharge of 2.5 percent on their taxes - small wonder then that the perceived waste of taxpayers ' money unleashed such fierce political debate . it recently emerged that thüringen and saxony-anhalt were intending to spend some of the solidarity pact funds on education , on the basis of it being conducive to economic growth , while , according to the finance ministry , the eastern german states spent just 39 percent of the allotted 8.5 billion euros on infrastructure in 2004 .
berlin , meanwhile , allegedly " misspent " 100 percent of its share . " we are not wasting anything , " insisted saxony-anhalt state premier wolfgang böhmer .
" even if we use it to pay teachers , police or administration costs , this does not amount to waste . " ailing economies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been told to clean up its act thriving regions are still few and far between in the former communist east .
unemployment remains stubbornly high with about 20 percent - which is almost twice as high as in the more well-to-do western germany . only in the state of saxony , home to a number of old and new economy enterprises , is a self-sustaining economy within reach , and state premier georg milbradt angered his eastern colleagues by rejecting demands for a relaxation of the rules governing the funds . " i think the other eastern states are wrong in assuming the funds can be used more efficiently for purposes other than investments , " he said .
" expenditure on things like better education will also have to be financed once the transfers will have ceased in the future . " people not concrete but the leaders of four of the five regional states have said it 's better to invest in people rather than concrete , and that rebuilding the east is seen merely as a matter of urban planning . " we have enough asphalted paths through our forests and enough theme parks , " said thüringen 's finance minister birgit diezel .
" what we need is greater scope to invest in people 's minds .

in a special session of parliament , lawmakers voted 113-96 to hold hearings on whether mr chen should be recalled .
mr chen now has one week to defend himself .
lawmakers are due to vote on 27 june on whether to hold a public referendum to recall the president .
but the opposition is unlikely to secure the two-thirds majority it needs to order the public vote , analysts say .
it has only a slim majority in the legislature and would need the support of independents and members of mr chen 's own party for the motion to pass .
mr chen has been facing mounting anger over a series of alleged scandals involving advisers and relatives , most recently when his son-in-law was detained in connection with allegations of insider trading .
on 1 june he ceded some of his powers to the prime minister to try and deflect the political crisis .
but this failed to placate the opposition , which pushed for the vote in the legislature .
first time it is the first time an attempt has been made to formally recall any taiwanese president , the bbc 's caroline gluck says .
the opposition is unlikely to achieve the majority it needs the vote was followed by tears and chanting from opposition politicians , while members of the ruling party held banners against the motion .
mr chen now has a week to issue a statement in his defence , after which the legislature begins a week of debates on his future ahead of the final vote .
the opposition kuomintang says it hopes some members of mr chen 's ruling democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- will back their motion .
" we hope dpp legislators can wake up to the truth , push one of their own severely according to law in order to uphold justice and stand on the side of the people , " tina pan of the kuomintang told reporters .
ruling party lawmakers have accused the opposition of trying to create social and political unrest , our correspondent says .

star angela gheorghiu and director jonathan kent explain why the time is right to re-evaluate puccini 's classic .
maria callas ' portrayal of tosca has become legendary for four decades , franco zeffirelli 's production of tosca was a mainstay of the royal opera house repertoire .
first presented in 1964 with maria callas as tosca and tito gobbi as police chief scarpia , it returned to covent garden year on year and was staged more than 240 times .
in 2004 , however , the decision was made to retire this long-running staple and commission a new version .
it is a move that makes sense to jonathan kent , the british director chosen to re-appraise giacomo puccini 's 1900 masterpiece for a 21st century audience .
" each generation has to reinvent these classics or they become museum pieces , " he told the bbc news website .
" because it was callas coming together with zeffirelli and gobbi , it 's one of those productions people who were n't even born get misty-eyed over .
" but i think 40 years is too long , no matter how great it was . "
' taut melodrama ' kent , formerly the joint artistic director of london 's almeida theatre , has a strong background in drama but is a relative newcomer to opera .
however , he believes tosca - which puccini adapted from a five-act french play - is an ideal vehicle for his talents .
" what i admire about it , quite apart from the thrilling music , is its theatre craft , " he said .
romanian soprano gheorghiu plays puccini 's heroine in the new tosca " it 's a taut , sinewy melodrama , exquisitely put together .
there is n't an ounce of flesh on it .
" puccini stripped the play down until it was an unstoppable arrow .
" that 's what interested me : to find a way within that hurtling narrative to examine the relationships and its themes of sex , power and death . "
set in 1800 rome , tosca tells of a celebrated opera singer whose determination to save her lover 's life leads her into a deadly imbroglio with the chief of police , baron scarpia .
in the first of the production 's two casts , tosca and scarpia are played by romanian soprano angela gheorghiu and welsh bass-baritone bryn terfel .
gheorghiu previously played tosca in a 2001 film but has yet to perform the entire role on stage .
surprisingly , she says it was harder to portray the character on screen than in the flesh .
climactic plummet " it 's much more difficult on camera , " the 40-year-old opera star told the bbc news website .
" this is one night , but on film it was every day for two months .
" it was hard to be there all the time - there was no way to escape .
i got tired . "
gheorghiu appears in six performances of the 12-night run with us soprano catherine naglestad stepping in for the remaining performances .
welsh opera star terfel portrays the villainous baron scarpia but the ghost of callas does not haunt the romanian singer , especially as she found her predecessor 's portrayal wanting in some departments .
" to my taste she did n't understand the role , " she explains in slightly fractured but highly expressive english .
" i think she was all the time furious , hysterical .
" i want to be much more feminine and have moments when i make decisions and have power . "
if there is one aspect that gives her pause , it is tosca 's climactic plummet from the battlements of the castel sant 'angelo .
" i never done the jumping !
that 's the only thing i did n't rehearse , " says gheorghiu .
" i have a list of people who want to catch me . "
rather that than the trampoline used in one chicago production , which - or so the story goes - saw tosca re-appear from behind the castle walls .
tosca runs at the royal opera house from 13 june to 8 july .

star angela gheorghiu and director jonathan kent explain why the time is right to re-evaluate puccini 's classic .
for four decades , franco zeffirelli 's production of tosca was a mainstay of the royal opera house repertoire .
first presented in 1964 with maria callas as tosca and tito gobbi as police chief scarpia , it returned to covent garden year on year and was staged more than 240 times .
in 2004 , however , the decision was made to retire this long-running staple and commission a new version .
it is a move that makes sense to jonathan kent , the british director chosen to re-appraise giacomo puccini 's 1900 masterpiece for a 21st century audience .
" each generation has to reinvent these classics or they become museum pieces , " he told the bbc news website .
" because it was callas coming together with zeffirelli and gobbi , it 's one of those productions people who were n't even born get misty-eyed over .
" but i think 40 years is too long , no matter how great it was . "
' taut melodrama ' kent , formerly the joint artistic director of london 's almeida theatre , has a strong background in drama but is a relative newcomer to opera .

but it is often their only means of survival .
cheap labour is one commodity india has in abundance .
hidden from public view though , is another workforce .
in an isolated spot , miles from the nearest town , is a thriving matchstick industry .
here inside makeshift straw huts - and in the small dwellings that neighbour them - we found some of india 's youngest workers .
rows of exhausted young girls - up to 20 and as young as five are working alongside their mothers .
for 16 hours a day their tiny blistered fingers skilfully turn out matches for export .
ordered to leave the toxic smell of sulphur is overwhelming in the windowless room .
child labour 2006 218m aged 5-17 in work 126m in hazardous work almost 50m work in africa 122m work in asia 70 % of workers in agriculture estimated cost of ending child labour : $ 760m over 20 years source : international labour organisation read the full ilo report -lrb- 1.1mb -rrb- most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader download the reader here twelve-year-old sindhu dips the tips of the sticks into hot sulphur .
" i start work early but do n't finish until late into the night .
i get paid less than two dollars a week . "
our presence was clearly not welcome .
as we were speaking to the girls the owner came in and ordered us to leave .
within walking distance are other factories .
but again , when we arrived , the youngest workers were quickly led away .
while the factory owner denied he was employing underage workers , almost every single household in this part of tamil nadu has one or more children working long hours in appalling conditions .
campaigners say over 11 million children are forced to work in india .
lighting a fire for a rare family meal , sarojama gathers her five grandchildren around her .
exploited she has barely been able to feed them , so she was forced to borrow money from a local factory owner .
campaigners say over 11 million children work in india unable to pay back the loan she sent her young grand-daughter to work .
parimeeta was taken out of school and has been working 12 hour days for two years .
the debt is less than $ 20 .
campaigners fear that as india 's economy continues to boom , children are increasingly being exploited to meet the country 's hunger for global success .
in a recent raid in the capital delhi , police rescued a large number of boys from local sweatshops .
agents had lured them from india 's poorest regions , promising the children that they would be taken care of and paid well .
they were found hidden on the top floors of garment factories - held captive in filthy cramped rooms under lock and key .
they painstakingly spent hours applying crystals to garments .
many of the clothes end up being sold in shops in the uk .
ineffective these are places the authorities say are difficult to close down .
but swami agnivesh of the bonded liberation front says that hundreds of children are kept hidden from public view in the buildings of crammed alleyways .
" they are kept in the most appalling conditions and not enough is being done to help them , " he said .
india has laws in place to protect children and bans the use of young workers , but they remain pretty ineffective .
the united nations children 's ' fund says that the sheer volume of children engaged in work is living proof of the world 's failure to protect them .
that is the reason why the agency 's work is focused on building a protective environment which safeguards children from exploitation and abuse .
in tamil nadu local charities have helped pay off families ' debts so that at least some children can be released from the matchstick factories .
finally freed from the shackles of work , they now have some hope of reliving their childhood .
bu it is often a dream that is short-lived .
charity workers admit most of the children are likely to find themselves forced back into a life of bondage .

the violence is worsening - in the last few weeks hundreds of people have died , and in the last two days there have been three significant battles in the south of the country .
every day the list of dead and injured increases , whether it be through the fighting , which has killed many afghan security personnel , or assassinations , roadside or suicide bombs .
and the south of the country has recently become the most dangerous .
quick guide afghanistan the canadian troops who have had responsibility for neighbouring kandahar province and commanding the whole south for the last few months have already lost nine people this year .
fighting ' peak ' as the british deployment began , senior officers were talking about a peak in fighting which would coincide with their arrival in helmand province .
they were worried by how long this would last and at what cost .
over the last four-and-a-half years there have been just a handful of us-led coalition troops on the ground in helmand and now there are thousands of soldiers with a mission to help the afghan authorities bring security to an area which is outside government control .
the british forces say that their presence is disturbing the status quo and will no doubt provoke a reaction from " people who just do n't want us to be there . "
this means criminals working in the illegal opium trade , local warlords and of course the taleban fighters , who appear to have been expanding in numbers over the past few months .
they are , however , still confident that people broadly support the coalition and the nato-led force and want the international community here - a big difference to the perception in iraq .
taleban influence but sources in helmand say there is not one district in the province which does not come under taleban influence and there are many areas where they are " in control . "
until people start to see things changing they are unlikely to stop supporting , or at the very least tolerating , the taleban fighters in their villages .
on the whole this means they openly move around and are a serious presence - enough to intimidate local people and for them to see the taleban as the real power rather than the government .
it takes little more than a pick-up truck full of armed taleban fighters driving down the main street to make that point .
but some villages are no-go areas for the police and army , particularly at night , and it is these the british forces are helping to secure - an incredibly difficult task .
it is easy enough to send the paras into an area with the afghan national army , clash with and drive out taleban militia , especially with the help of air-power , but then what ?
when the troops pull back to base , the taleban simply come back a few days later and it starts all over again .
the way the british troops are dealing with this is to set up a well protected compound in the town or village and help the police and army establish a base and maintain a small presence .
but helmand is four times the size of wales .
there are many towns and villages and with just a couple of thousand british troops supporting an inexperienced national army this constant expansion becomes difficult .
the whole point of the mission is to bring security and then almost immediately roll out development programmes , to show people that by supporting the government and the british forces their lives will improve .
the department for international development and the foreign and commonwealth office are working closely with the military to achieve this .
tens of millions of pounds have been made available .
but for the moment the security situation is just not good enough to roll out these programmes and until people start to see things changing they are unlikely to stop supporting , or at the very least tolerating , the taleban fighters in their villages .
public opinion the taleban government was born out of the religious scholars in southern afghanistan where their conservative views are normal and where , despite the barbaric rules , they did bring security .
that is what people most want at the moment .
a senior british military commander describes the mission in helmand as " to win the support of the floating voter " - the 80 % of people who want security and change and will support whoever can provide it .
at the moment the opinion polls show disappointment with what the democratic government has done or what all the billions of pounds of aid money has brought people .
there 's no doubt the british forces who will be working under nato have a great opportunity to make a difference .
but their success will depend on how long this " peak " of resistance goes on for , how much damage the taleban fighters can do and ultimately what losses the british and other international forces can take before public opinion at home starts to question and threaten their continued involvement in the mission .

the whole point of the mission is to bring security and then almost immediately roll out development programmes , to show people that by supporting the government and the british forces their lives will improve .
the department for international development and the foreign and commonwealth office are working closely with the military to achieve this .

public opinion the taleban government was born out of the religious scholars in southern afghanistan where their conservative views are normal and where , despite the barbaric rules , they did bring security .
that is what people most want at the moment .

there 's no doubt the british forces who will be working under nato have a great opportunity to make a difference .
but their success will depend on how long this " peak " of resistance goes on for , how much damage the taleban fighters can do and ultimately what losses the british and other international forces can take before public opinion at home starts to question and threaten their continued involvement in the mission .

the violence is worsening - in the last few weeks hundreds of people have died , and in the last two days there have been three significant battles in the south of the country .
every day the list of dead and injured increases , whether it be through the fighting , which has killed many afghan security personnel , or assassinations , roadside or suicide bombs .
and the south of the country has recently become the most dangerous .
quick guide afghanistan the canadian troops who have had responsibility for neighbouring kandahar province and commanding the whole south for the last few months have already lost nine people this year .
fighting ' peak ' as the british deployment began , senior officers were talking about a peak in fighting which would coincide with their arrival in helmand province .
they were worried by how long this would last and at what cost .
over the last four-and-a-half years there have been just a handful of us-led coalition troops on the ground in helmand and now there are thousands of soldiers with a mission to help the afghan authorities bring security to an area which is outside government control .
the british forces say that their presence is disturbing the status quo and will no doubt provoke a reaction from " people who just do n't want us to be there . "
this means criminals working in the illegal opium trade , local warlords and of course the taleban fighters , who appear to have been expanding in numbers over the past few months .
they are , however , still confident that people broadly support the coalition and the nato-led force and want the international community here - a big difference to the perception in iraq .
taleban influence but sources in helmand say there is not one district in the province which does not come under taleban influence and there are many areas where they are " in control . "
until people start to see things changing they are unlikely to stop supporting , or at the very least tolerating , the taleban fighters in their villages .
on the whole this means they openly move around and are a serious presence - enough to intimidate local people and for them to see the taleban as the real power rather than the government .
it takes little more than a pick-up truck full of armed taleban fighters driving down the main street to make that point .
but some villages are no-go areas for the police and army , particularly at night , and it is these the british forces are helping to secure - an incredibly difficult task .
it is easy enough to send the paras into an area with the afghan national army , clash with and drive out taleban militia , especially with the help of air-power , but then what ?
when the troops pull back to base , the taleban simply come back a few days later and it starts all over again .
the way the british troops are dealing with this is to set up a well protected compound in the town or village and help the police and army establish a base and maintain a small presence .
but helmand is four times the size of wales .

sir michael lyons , who is conducting an inquiry into the future of the tax , told the times newspaper he was looking at environmental taxes .
these would be paid in addition to council tax to make the cost of services more visible .
the plan raises the prospect of waste being weighed by refuse collectors .

sir michael was commissioned by deputy prime minister john prescott and chancellor gordon brown in july 2004 to undertake an independent inquiry into local government funding .

the cells are drawn from human embryos and can be used to duplicate different types of tissue .
critics say most stem cells are taken from embryos which have the potential to become human beings and that it is wrong to use them for experiments .
the european commission wants to keep the same policy - which funds some stem cell research but not the use of cloned stem cells - for the next six-year framework research programme .

seven-week-old aaron rai from windsor had the operation after his father found one of only two doctors in the world who do the procedure in babies .
professor james aquavella , who carried out the surgery at rochester eye institute in new york , said the two-hour operation went ' very well ' .
the team has done 19 such operations in children - all have been successful .
" with this prosthesis in place the quality of the vision should be good but what has to happen is the brain has to learn how to use that image . "
professor james aquavella aaron was born with an anterior segment development disorder in his right eye - which meant he could n't see out of the eye because the cornea , the transparent dome of tissue that covers the eye and focuses light , was opaque .
the operation to replace his cornea with a plastic prosthesis was carried out on monday .
aaron 's father surinder rai , found the us team willing to carry out the operation after british doctors decided the potential benefits of surgery did not outweigh the risks because aaron could still see out of one eye .
professor aquavella told the bbc website that they found no other problem with aaron 's eye and the operation went ahead as planned .
" we are very pleased .
with this prosthesis in place the quality of the vision should be good but what has to happen is the brain has to learn how to use that image . "
eye patch other operations by professor aquavella have been done in children aged four weeks to seven years - aaron is the second youngest child to be fitted with an artificial implant .
" the ideal case is to operate before two months of age , " he said and explained that if you operate early the brain can learn to process visual information properly .
" starting over the next few days the other eye will be patched for a few hours a day - the idea is to get him to use an eye that he has n't been using before . "
he added : " it will be years before we can assess definitively whether the operation has been successful because he has to be old enough to read out letters and answer questions but there are ways we can assess the eye in the meantime , for instance we can give the child objects of different sizes to play with . "
aaron was able to leave the hospital later the same day to spend the night with his parents in the hotel .
they plan to return to the uk at the weekend .
hoping for a breakthrough in the uk , transplants are done using corneas from donors but usually only in children who are blind in both eyes .
mr ken nischal , consultant ophthalmologist at great ormond street hospital for children , examined aaron before he went to the us .
he said : " we have a tremendous amount of experience in these children ; we have done 63 corneal grafts in babies . "
" i 'm supportive of the parents choice ; it was a difficult decision for them and i 'm hoping this is a breakthrough but i do n't have any scientific data to analyse .
" i feel apprehensive because we do n't have the data .
even if i had the experience with this -lsb- type of artificial implant -rsb- i would n't have done it in this child .
" we do n't know how long the material will last - it might not last longer than 10 years . "
he added that with one good eye , aaron would be able to lead a perfectly normal life .
ranjit rai , aaron 's mother , told the times she was initially " very worried " about the operation but was won over during a trip to the us to meet professor aquavella .
" we were very fortunate in that we were sufficiently focused and that our perseverance paid off so that we were able to identify an alternative way forward , " she said .

" starting over the next few days the other eye will be patched for a few hours a day - the idea is to get him to use an eye that he has n't been using before . "
he added : " it will be years before we can assess definitively whether the operation has been successful because he has to be old enough to read out letters and answer questions but there are ways we can assess the eye in the meantime , for instance we can give the child objects of different sizes to play with .

mr ken nischal , consultant ophthalmologist at great ormond street hospital for children , examined aaron before he went to the us .
he said : " we have a tremendous amount of experience in these children ; we have done 63 corneal grafts in babies . "
" i 'm supportive of the parents choice ; it was a difficult decision for them and i 'm hoping this is a breakthrough but i do n't have any scientific data to analyse .
" i feel apprehensive because we do n't have the data .

" we do n't know how long the material will last - it might not last longer than 10 years . "
he added that with one good eye , aaron would be able to lead a perfectly normal life .
ranjit rai , aaron 's mother , told the times she was initially " very worried " about the operation but was won over during a trip to the us to meet professor aquavella .
" we were very fortunate in that we were sufficiently focused and that our perseverance paid off so that we were able to identify an alternative way forward , " she said .

seven-week-old aaron rai from windsor had the operation after his father found one of only two doctors in the world who do the procedure in babies .
professor james aquavella , who carried out the surgery at rochester eye institute in new york , said the two-hour operation went ' very well ' .
the team has done 19 such operations in children - all have been successful .
" with this prosthesis in place the quality of the vision should be good but what has to happen is the brain has to learn how to use that image . "
professor james aquavella aaron was born with an anterior segment development disorder in his right eye - which meant he could n't see out of the eye because the cornea , the transparent dome of tissue that covers the eye and focuses light , was opaque .
the operation to replace his cornea with a plastic prosthesis was carried out on monday .
aaron 's father surinder rai , found the us team willing to carry out the operation after british doctors decided the potential benefits of surgery did not outweigh the risks because aaron could still see out of one eye .
professor aquavella told the bbc website that they found no other problem with aaron 's eye and the operation went ahead as planned .
