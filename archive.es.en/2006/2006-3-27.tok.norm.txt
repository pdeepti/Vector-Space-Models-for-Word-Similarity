" the credit she accumulated recently with her feel-good governing style and her faultless round of the world 's red carpets could be used up very quickly , " it warned . the frankfurter rundschau warned that now the state elections were over , the coalition has " lost its only remaining excuse " for not tackling controversial issues .
" it is no longer enough to make a good impression at home and abroad - action is needed now , " the paper insisted . the süddeutsche zeitung called merkel 's coalition a " complex mobile " which " starts to tremble with every draught , swings up and down if there is a wind and gets tangled up in a storm .

merkel had feared a debacle for the social democrats could destabilize the alliance . " i am pleased as the chairman of the german social democrats that i am able to welcome election victories in state polls , " matthias platzeck said .
he was referring to a string of state poll defeats for the social democrats which prompted merkel 's predecessor chancellor gerhard schröder to call for new elections which set the wheels in motion for his ouster . in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , the prosperous home of auto giants daimlerchrysler and porsche , the conservatives captured 44.2 percent of the vote , according to provisional official figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were favorable ; the turnout was n't the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats . voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party which won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21.4 percent . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . healthy results but poor voter turnout they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt and a pure social democrat government in rhineland-palatinate would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , meaning the free democrats have little power to block legislation . total electoral turnout in the three states , however , was only about 60 percent , a historic low . the leader of the opposition greens party claudia roth said the grand coalition was leading to " depoliticization " - turning voters off the political process . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state elections keep premiers in place conservatives and social democrats held on to power in three german state polls sunday , signaling good news for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns . fifa early warning system gmbh might more resemble the name of an anti-terror company .
the matter of possible terrorist attacks is not being neglected by anyone involved with the world cup , but early warning system gmbh has another mission - the prevention of illegal betting operations . speaking to reporters on friday at the conclusion of a four-day workshop for world cup referee candidates , fifa 's general secretary urs linsi said the company was created back in january 2006 as a response to the robert hoyzer betting scandal that broke in germany last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen -lrb- red -rrb- was possibly at center of manipulation in 2002-03 that is not the only scandal that has come to the surface in germany .
state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .
early warning system will be cooperating with companies that specialize in spotting what could be potential attempts at manipulating games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer 's involvement in match-fixing started an avalanche in german soccer " i think we 've taken the necessary steps to prevent match-fixing .
and this is not just for the world cup , " linsi said . the hoyzer scandal was a huge embarrassment to germany in the long run-up to the world cup that the country is hosting from june 9 to july 9 .
late last year the former referee was found guilty of fixing matches in a betting fraud worth two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.39 bill . -rrb- . hoyzer was sentenced last november to two years and five months for his role in the affair . linsi said that he believed that the hoyzer scandal in germany was an exception .
match-fixing reaches far beyond germany 's borders .
to fight this , fifa 's executive committee recently approved a task force report to investigate better preventative measures .
one method would be improved cooperation between fifa confederations and the national associations . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer chiefs deny schweinsteiger allegations german soccer chiefs on thursday issued a vehement denial of a newspaper claim that bayern munich star bastian schweinsteiger was the international footballer involved in a betting scandal .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .

" spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .
" it 's good that we now have a movie like this , but it 's also good to have films that show the more positive side of life back then .
there were two sides , you know .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.03.2006 clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said more money is needed to help those affected by the tsunami former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells . " recovery is going to take years .
fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .
" there was no early warning system and now we are all living with the results , " clinton said .
asian warning system due in july the un 's top humanitarian official , jan egeland , said on monday in bonn that a tsunami warning system would be inaugurated in asia by july but admitted that many communities would still not be plugged into it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said rich countries would pay sooner or later a un source said clinton and egeland were meeting behind closed doors at the conference with representatives of the 28 countries in the indian ocean to push them to take steps that would ensure the warnings reach their people . " from july the scientific part of the project will be implemented .
we will have gauges throughout the indian ocean sending data out every 10 minutes , " she said . though this meant that the mainland of every country in the region would be warned of an impending tsunami , most nations that were struck in december 2004 have not put in place communication systems and evacuation paths to help people to safety when the next one strikes . " the rest of what is needed to get the information to the people is not in place .
president clinton 's real aim here is to tell them to get on with it , " the source , who asked not to be named , added .
just a matter of time in an opening address to the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the question was not whether such an event would shake the world again , but when .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said it 's merely a matter of time before another such disaster strikes " the chain of natural disasters has hardly been interrupted since the asian tsunami ...
hurricane katrina , then the kashmir earthquake that buried 16,000 people in their homes .
we can not halt the forces of nature , " he said . instead the international community needed to reduce the vulnerability of people , especially the poor , to weather disasters , with a first step being to warn them to move to safe ground .
steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .
he said video footage shot during the tsunami showed a settlement leaving their homes and running for high ground , from where they saw their possessions being washing away by the tsunami . " afterwards the children told reporters that they had been taught by their grandparents to read the signs of a sea surge .
it shows that warning systems can function without technology and great financial input , " he said . the conference runs until wednesday and will see delegates vet more than 100 project proposals for warning systems around the world . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talks aim to improve world 's disaster-readiness experts from 140 nations meet in germany from monday to see how far the world has come with early warning systems in the 15 months since the devastating asian tsunami .

" recovery is going to take years .
fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .
" there was no early warning system and now we are all living with the results , " clinton said .
asian warning system due in july the un 's top humanitarian official , jan egeland , said on monday in bonn that a tsunami warning system would be inaugurated in asia by july but admitted that many communities would still not be plugged into it .

" from july the scientific part of the project will be implemented .
we will have gauges throughout the indian ocean sending data out every 10 minutes , " she said . though this meant that the mainland of every country in the region would be warned of an impending tsunami , most nations that were struck in december 2004 have not put in place communication systems and evacuation paths to help people to safety when the next one strikes . " the rest of what is needed to get the information to the people is not in place .
president clinton 's real aim here is to tell them to get on with it , " the source , who asked not to be named , added .
just a matter of time in an opening address to the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the question was not whether such an event would shake the world again , but when .

we can not halt the forces of nature , " he said . instead the international community needed to reduce the vulnerability of people , especially the poor , to weather disasters , with a first step being to warn them to move to safe ground .
steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .
he said video footage shot during the tsunami showed a settlement leaving their homes and running for high ground , from where they saw their possessions being washing away by the tsunami . " afterwards the children told reporters that they had been taught by their grandparents to read the signs of a sea surge .

at the pilot cascade in the iranian city of natanz , " there is just piping to be finished , then they do vacuum tests , then they would test with inert gas and finally they would put in uranium gas to begin the process , " said a diplomat close to the vienna-based iaea . the remarks came at a time when talks within the un security council on a statement calling iran to account for its suspected nuclear weapons activities have reached an impasse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear facility in isfahan in iran the united states and its allies charge that iran 's nuclear program conceals an effort to develop weapons and have urged it to halt sensitive uranium enrichment activities .

the shipments included electronic parts and special cables .
according to an ard report , the iranians had attempted to acquire hydraulic pumps and transformer parts in germany . a spokesman put the value of the deliveries at between two and three million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 and 3.6 million -rrb- two million euros were seized in the raid of the berlin business . strict export rules in germany the un nuclear watchdog has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us accusations that tehran is using its civilian nuclear power program to hide an atomic weapons program .

still , vintners worry about what the future may bring . it 's a good time for german wine .
exports increased last year to 475 million euros -lrb- $ 569 million -rrb- , 10 percent more than the previous year and the highest level they 've been at since 1985 when an austrian wine scandal had a devastating knock-on effect in germany .
britain remains german wine 's biggest importer followed by the us and the netherlands .
and consumers have been devoting more attention to germany 's top wines , riesling above all . " the aficionados are in america first and foremost , " said prince michael zu salm-salm , head of germany 's fine wine association vdp .
" a riesling boom is underway in the united states , a real renaissance .
but the aficionados are also in southern europe .
in italy , in spain we 're gaining momentum dramatically .
and we can truly say that it 's a development that 's beginning to have a worldwide effect . " the success of riesling does n't merely have to do with the grape 's flavor , but also with the increasing number of foreign journalists who give german wine good marks , particularly wine guru robert parker . trouble brewing ? despite the boom in exports , german vintners are troubled by a recent addition to a winemaking agreement between the european union and the united states .
a coda to the accord , added in march , allows the americans to export wines to europe that have been chemically and physically treated using controversial techniques that are largely prohibited in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince zu salm-salm speaks for germany 's quality wine producers " there are two critical points to the agreement , " said monika christmann , an expert on cellar techniques at geisenheim technical college .
" for one , that all future techniques , that do n't yet even exist , have been approved .
that means that we must accept everything that comes from america in the future , and with that , the americans practically set the standard worldwide .
the second critical point is that an integral part of the agreement is that all these techniques can be employed without declaring it on the label . " thus , consumers wo n't be able to tell how a wine was treated and whether a wine labelled as having been produced " according to the manner of a johannisberg riesling " is indeed a johannisberg riesling . power of the purse two figures are crucial in order to understand why the eu agriculture ministers agreed to the deal : us wine exports to the eu were worth $ 325 million in 2005 , while eu exports to the us were valued at $ 2.6 billion . but the agreement has caused quite a bit of hysteria in europe , with a plethora of newspaper articles upbraiding so-called artificial or plastic wines from the us , and largely demonstrating ignorance of the facts .
politicians from the german neo-nazi npd party also took advantage of the controversy to promote anti-american sentiments with their slogan " german wine instead of american rotgut . "
german vintners ended up feeling like they had to defend the us at the same time as criticizing it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in cellar techniques have some vintners worried " the fact is , all over the world there are vintners who are craftsmen like us , said zu salm-salm .
" and in europe , too , there are companies that are more used to working industrially . " " in america , it 's basically accepted - not in california , but in other parts of america - to add water to wine or to separate it with spinning doctor machines and then reconstruct it .
naturally , that goes entirely against our understanding of wine . ...
we 're opposed to the wine trade agreement and demand that improvements are made to it , " he said . the deadline for changes to the deal ends in three months .
by then it will be clear whether german vintners can save their designations of origin and whether it will become obligatory to declare particular cellar techniques .

still , vintners worry about what the future may bring . it 's a good time for german wine .
exports increased last year to 475 million euros -lrb- $ 569 million -rrb- , 10 percent more than the previous year and the highest level they 've been at since 1985 when an austrian wine scandal had a devastating knock-on effect in germany .
britain remains german wine 's biggest importer followed by the us and the netherlands .
and consumers have been devoting more attention to germany 's top wines , riesling above all . " the aficionados are in america first and foremost , " said prince michael zu salm-salm , head of germany 's fine wine association vdp .
" a riesling boom is underway in the united states , a real renaissance .
but the aficionados are also in southern europe .
in italy , in spain we 're gaining momentum dramatically .
and we can truly say that it 's a development that 's beginning to have a worldwide effect . " the success of riesling does n't merely have to do with the grape 's flavor , but also with the increasing number of foreign journalists who give german wine good marks , particularly wine guru robert parker . trouble brewing ? despite the boom in exports , german vintners are troubled by a recent addition to a winemaking agreement between the european union and the united states .
a coda to the accord , added in march , allows the americans to export wines to europe that have been chemically and physically treated using controversial techniques that are largely prohibited in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince zu salm-salm speaks for germany 's quality wine producers " there are two critical points to the agreement , " said monika christmann , an expert on cellar techniques at geisenheim technical college .
" for one , that all future techniques , that do n't yet even exist , have been approved .
that means that we must accept everything that comes from america in the future , and with that , the americans practically set the standard worldwide .
the second critical point is that an integral part of the agreement is that all these techniques can be employed without declaring it on the label . " thus , consumers wo n't be able to tell how a wine was treated and whether a wine labelled as having been produced " according to the manner of a johannisberg riesling " is indeed a johannisberg riesling . power of the purse two figures are crucial in order to understand why the eu agriculture ministers agreed to the deal : us wine exports to the eu were worth $ 325 million in 2005 , while eu exports to the us were valued at $ 2.6 billion . but the agreement has caused quite a bit of hysteria in europe , with a plethora of newspaper articles upbraiding so-called artificial or plastic wines from the us , and largely demonstrating ignorance of the facts .
politicians from the german neo-nazi npd party also took advantage of the controversy to promote anti-american sentiments with their slogan " german wine instead of american rotgut . "
german vintners ended up feeling like they had to defend the us at the same time as criticizing it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in cellar techniques have some vintners worried " the fact is , all over the world there are vintners who are craftsmen like us , said zu salm-salm .
" and in europe , too , there are companies that are more used to working industrially . " " in america , it 's basically accepted - not in california , but in other parts of america - to add water to wine or to separate it with spinning doctor machines and then reconstruct it .
naturally , that goes entirely against our understanding of wine . ...
we 're opposed to the wine trade agreement and demand that improvements are made to it , " he said . the deadline for changes to the deal ends in three months .
by then it will be clear whether german vintners can save their designations of origin and whether it will become obligatory to declare particular cellar techniques .
but neither outcome is likely . günther birkenstock -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sour over us-eu wine deal the eu has approved a transatlantic deal opening the glutted european wine market to imports from the us .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns . fifa early warning system gmbh might more resemble the name of an anti-terror company .
the matter of possible terrorist attacks is not being neglected by anyone involved with the world cup , but early warning system gmbh has another mission - the prevention of illegal betting operations . speaking to reporters on friday at the conclusion of a four-day workshop for world cup referee candidates , fifa 's general secretary urs linsi said the company was created back in january 2006 as a response to the robert hoyzer betting scandal that broke in germany last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen -lrb- red -rrb- was possibly at center of manipulation in 2002-03 that is not the only scandal that has come to the surface in germany .
state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .
early warning system will be cooperating with companies that specialize in spotting what could be potential attempts at manipulating games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer 's involvement in match-fixing started an avalanche in german soccer " i think we 've taken the necessary steps to prevent match-fixing .
and this is not just for the world cup , " linsi said . the hoyzer scandal was a huge embarrassment to germany in the long run-up to the world cup that the country is hosting from june 9 to july 9 .
late last year the former referee was found guilty of fixing matches in a betting fraud worth two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.39 bill . -rrb- . hoyzer was sentenced last november to two years and five months for his role in the affair . linsi said that he believed that the hoyzer scandal in germany was an exception .
match-fixing reaches far beyond germany 's borders .
to fight this , fifa 's executive committee recently approved a task force report to investigate better preventative measures .
one method would be improved cooperation between fifa confederations and the national associations . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer chiefs deny schweinsteiger allegations german soccer chiefs on thursday issued a vehement denial of a newspaper claim that bayern munich star bastian schweinsteiger was the international footballer involved in a betting scandal .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .
" it 's good that we now have a movie like this , but it 's also good to have films that show the more positive side of life back then .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns . fifa early warning system gmbh might more resemble the name of an anti-terror company .
the matter of possible terrorist attacks is not being neglected by anyone involved with the world cup , but early warning system gmbh has another mission - the prevention of illegal betting operations . speaking to reporters on friday at the conclusion of a four-day workshop for world cup referee candidates , fifa 's general secretary urs linsi said the company was created back in january 2006 as a response to the robert hoyzer betting scandal that broke in germany last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen -lrb- red -rrb- was possibly at center of manipulation in 2002-03 that is not the only scandal that has come to the surface in germany .
state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .

" sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin !

the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .

that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner . " the first two international conferences on early warning were held in germany in 1998 and 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

the gbl stake is reportedly worth four to five million euros .
the sources said the plans are at an early stage . as well as the stake in sony bmg - the new york-based joint venture of bertelsmann and japan 's sony - the german group is considering selling its wholly-owned bmg music publishing business , the ft said . together , the music companies reported revenues of 2.1 billion euros last year , down 16.5 percent as cd sales fell , the report said . bertelsma n n ow n ers oppose public offeri n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen gunter thielen , bertelsmann 's chief executive , said last week the company would not decide about any moves until it knew more about the intentions of gbl , which has the right to place its stake in bertelsmann from may , potentially leading to an initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- .
but he did not rule out selling the music companies . bertelsmann , which owns european broadcaster rtl and book publisher random house among other businesses , is privately owned by the mohn family .
the family is reportedly opposed to taking the company to the stock market and is therefore looking for ways to buy back the gbl stake to prevent an ipo . sony has the right to take full control of the joint venture , which is second only to vivendi 's universal music , but is not expected to invest more in media while it is still fixing its electronics arm , the ft said . in tokyo , sony spokesman koji kurata declined to comment on the report , which he said was " based on speculation of a move by bertelsmann .

" recovery is going to take years .
fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .
" there was no early warning system and now we are all living with the results , " clinton said .
asian warning system due in july the un 's top humanitarian official , jan egeland , said on monday in bonn that a tsunami warning system would be inaugurated in asia by july but admitted that many communities would still not be plugged into it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said rich countries would pay sooner or later a un source said clinton and egeland were meeting behind closed doors at the conference with representatives of the 28 countries in the indian ocean to push them to take steps that would ensure the warnings reach their people . " from july the scientific part of the project will be implemented .
we will have gauges throughout the indian ocean sending data out every 10 minutes , " she said . though this meant that the mainland of every country in the region would be warned of an impending tsunami , most nations that were struck in december 2004 have not put in place communication systems and evacuation paths to help people to safety when the next one strikes . " the rest of what is needed to get the information to the people is not in place .
president clinton 's real aim here is to tell them to get on with it , " the source , who asked not to be named , added .
just a matter of time in an opening address to the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the question was not whether such an event would shake the world again , but when .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said it 's merely a matter of time before another such disaster strikes " the chain of natural disasters has hardly been interrupted since the asian tsunami ...
hurricane katrina , then the kashmir earthquake that buried 16,000 people in their homes .
we can not halt the forces of nature , " he said . instead the international community needed to reduce the vulnerability of people , especially the poor , to weather disasters , with a first step being to warn them to move to safe ground .
steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .
he said video footage shot during the tsunami showed a settlement leaving their homes and running for high ground , from where they saw their possessions being washing away by the tsunami . " afterwards the children told reporters that they had been taught by their grandparents to read the signs of a sea surge .
it shows that warning systems can function without technology and great financial input , " he said . the conference runs until wednesday and will see delegates vet more than 100 project proposals for warning systems around the world . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talks aim to improve world 's disaster-readiness experts from 140 nations meet in germany from monday to see how far the world has come with early warning systems in the 15 months since the devastating asian tsunami .

" recovery is going to take years .
fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .
" there was no early warning system and now we are all living with the results , " clinton said .
asian warning system due in july the un 's top humanitarian official , jan egeland , said on monday in bonn that a tsunami warning system would be inaugurated in asia by july but admitted that many communities would still not be plugged into it .

" from july the scientific part of the project will be implemented .
we will have gauges throughout the indian ocean sending data out every 10 minutes , " she said . though this meant that the mainland of every country in the region would be warned of an impending tsunami , most nations that were struck in december 2004 have not put in place communication systems and evacuation paths to help people to safety when the next one strikes . " the rest of what is needed to get the information to the people is not in place .
president clinton 's real aim here is to tell them to get on with it , " the source , who asked not to be named , added .

hurricane katrina , then the kashmir earthquake that buried 16,000 people in their homes .
we can not halt the forces of nature , " he said . instead the international community needed to reduce the vulnerability of people , especially the poor , to weather disasters , with a first step being to warn them to move to safe ground .
steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .
he said video footage shot during the tsunami showed a settlement leaving their homes and running for high ground , from where they saw their possessions being washing away by the tsunami . " afterwards the children told reporters that they had been taught by their grandparents to read the signs of a sea surge .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said rich countries would pay sooner or later a un source said clinton and egeland were meeting behind closed doors at the conference with representatives of the 28 countries in the indian ocean to push them to take steps that would ensure the warnings reach their people . " from july the scientific part of the project will be implemented .
we will have gauges throughout the indian ocean sending data out every 10 minutes , " she said . though this meant that the mainland of every country in the region would be warned of an impending tsunami , most nations that were struck in december 2004 have not put in place communication systems and evacuation paths to help people to safety when the next one strikes . " the rest of what is needed to get the information to the people is not in place .
president clinton 's real aim here is to tell them to get on with it , " the source , who asked not to be named , added .
just a matter of time in an opening address to the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the question was not whether such an event would shake the world again , but when .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said it 's merely a matter of time before another such disaster strikes " the chain of natural disasters has hardly been interrupted since the asian tsunami ...
hurricane katrina , then the kashmir earthquake that buried 16,000 people in their homes .
we can not halt the forces of nature , " he said . instead the international community needed to reduce the vulnerability of people , especially the poor , to weather disasters , with a first step being to warn them to move to safe ground .
steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .
he said video footage shot during the tsunami showed a settlement leaving their homes and running for high ground , from where they saw their possessions being washing away by the tsunami . " afterwards the children told reporters that they had been taught by their grandparents to read the signs of a sea surge .
it shows that warning systems can function without technology and great financial input , " he said . the conference runs until wednesday and will see delegates vet more than 100 project proposals for warning systems around the world . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talks aim to improve world 's disaster-readiness experts from 140 nations meet in germany from monday to see how far the world has come with early warning systems in the 15 months since the devastating asian tsunami .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner . " the first two international conferences on early warning were held in germany in 1998 and 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

" we will work all day monday and maybe even a bit on tuesday , " yaroslav davydovych , the head of ukraine 's central election commission , told reporters . the regions party , headed by russia-friendly ex-premier viktor yanukovich , led with 24.58 percent , " orange revolution " heroine yulia tymoshenko 's bloc had 24.08 percent , and president viktor yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc was in third with 17.01 percent , the preliminary results showed .
exit polls released after the close of voting sunday suggested regions would get 31 percent of the overall vote , timoshenko 's bloc 24 percent , and our ukraine would be third with 16 percent .

" this is a blow for yushchenko , but not defeat , " said bondarenko . timoshenko or yanukovich as premier ?
tymoshenko , too , downplayed the regions victory , saying an " orange " coalition would relegate yanukovich 's party to an opposition role in the new parliament . " this is absolutely okay .
the country needs a strong opposition , " timoshenko said in early morning televised remarks .
tymoshenko looks set to regain the premiership in a coalition with our ukraine . " our ukraine has agreed on the position that the force that gets the most votes ... will propose its candidacy for the prime minister 's post , " said roman bezsmertnyi , campaign chief for our ukraine . when asked what would happen if yushchenko refused her candidacy for the premiership , tymoshenko said in televised comments : " he would have to agree to the premiership of -lrb- viktor -rrb- yanukovich .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean .

the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .

" i see the outcome as an affirmation of what the grand coalition has accomplished until now and encouragement for the steps ahead , " merkel told reporters at her party headquarters on monday .
" we will put issues on the agenda .
tough working weeks lie ahead of us . " observers from across the political spectrum said it was now time after the coalition 's extended political honeymoon for it to face up to daunting problems including the ailing health care system , the 12-percent jobless rate and the overhaul of the creaking federal system . " everybody feels like a winner , " political analyst peter lösche told rolling news channel n24 .
" now they can get on with the business of governing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt faces a tough time with her reforms merkel presented a long list of policy initiatives for the " second stage " of her term focusing on reform of the federal system , family policy , health care , government red tape , energy policy , the labor market and corporate taxes . the chancellor was due to meet health minister ulla schmidt later on monday to prepare cross-party talks scheduled for wednesday on health-care reform , according to government sources .
both coalition parties have pledged to narrow their differences on health care before parliament 's two-month summer recess , which begins on july 7 . press demand action , reserve judgement on merkel 's credentials commenting on merkel ’ s " phased " chancellorship ; the center-left berliner zeitung said the first stage had been dominated by confidence-building between the coalition parties but that the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda .

" i see the outcome as an affirmation of what the grand coalition has accomplished until now and encouragement for the steps ahead , " merkel told reporters at her party headquarters on monday .
" we will put issues on the agenda .
tough working weeks lie ahead of us . " observers from across the political spectrum said it was now time after the coalition 's extended political honeymoon for it to face up to daunting problems including the ailing health care system , the 12-percent jobless rate and the overhaul of the creaking federal system . " everybody feels like a winner , " political analyst peter lösche told rolling news channel n24 .
" now they can get on with the business of governing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt faces a tough time with her reforms merkel presented a long list of policy initiatives for the " second stage " of her term focusing on reform of the federal system , family policy , health care , government red tape , energy policy , the labor market and corporate taxes . the chancellor was due to meet health minister ulla schmidt later on monday to prepare cross-party talks scheduled for wednesday on health-care reform , according to government sources .
both coalition parties have pledged to narrow their differences on health care before parliament 's two-month summer recess , which begins on july 7 . press demand action , reserve judgement on merkel 's credentials commenting on merkel ’ s " phased " chancellorship ; the center-left berliner zeitung said the first stage had been dominated by confidence-building between the coalition parties but that the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition .
but also that they expect something of it .
the clear outcome of the poll is an order to begin in earnest with the work at hand , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and müntefering : " you hum it , i 'll play it " in germany ’ s neighbor , the vienna-based die presse said that merkel was facing her last chance to finally get to grips with urgently needed reforms .
so far the coalition 's performance , it says , has all the " soporific dynamism of a jazz bar session after midnight , with angela merkel softly stroking the drums with a little brush and -lrb- her spd deputy -rrb- franz müntefering plucking leisurely at the bass " . die presse added that the coalition parties , says the paper , will have to " step up their tempo considerably " as germany 's honeymoon with the new chancellor may only last a few more months .
" the credit she accumulated recently with her feel-good governing style and her faultless round of the world 's red carpets could be used up very quickly , " it warned . the frankfurter rundschau warned that now the state elections were over , the coalition has " lost its only remaining excuse " for not tackling controversial issues .
" it is no longer enough to make a good impression at home and abroad - action is needed now , " the paper insisted . the süddeutsche zeitung called merkel 's coalition a " complex mobile " which " starts to tremble with every draught , swings up and down if there is a wind and gets tangled up in a storm . "
while merkel has surprised people home and abroad with her unexpected popularity and respect " she has done so not through her actions , but through her failure to act ... she has only been a half chancellor , " it concluded . both sides of coalition relieved at election results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was pleased platzeck 's spd did n't cause any ructions however , despite the fact that the elections seemed to open possible floodgates of criticism , both governing parties in the coalition - traditional rivals - said the shared triumphs helped secure the balance of power in the " grand coalition " in berlin .

at the pilot cascade in the iranian city of natanz , " there is just piping to be finished , then they do vacuum tests , then they would test with inert gas and finally they would put in uranium gas to begin the process , " said a diplomat close to the vienna-based iaea . the remarks came at a time when talks within the un security council on a statement calling iran to account for its suspected nuclear weapons activities have reached an impasse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear facility in isfahan in iran the united states and its allies charge that iran 's nuclear program conceals an effort to develop weapons and have urged it to halt sensitive uranium enrichment activities .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns . fifa early warning system gmbh might more resemble the name of an anti-terror company .
the matter of possible terrorist attacks is not being neglected by anyone involved with the world cup , but early warning system gmbh has another mission - the prevention of illegal betting operations . speaking to reporters on friday at the conclusion of a four-day workshop for world cup referee candidates , fifa 's general secretary urs linsi said the company was created back in january 2006 as a response to the robert hoyzer betting scandal that broke in germany last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen -lrb- red -rrb- was possibly at center of manipulation in 2002-03 that is not the only scandal that has come to the surface in germany .
state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .
early warning system will be cooperating with companies that specialize in spotting what could be potential attempts at manipulating games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer 's involvement in match-fixing started an avalanche in german soccer " i think we 've taken the necessary steps to prevent match-fixing .
and this is not just for the world cup , " linsi said . the hoyzer scandal was a huge embarrassment to germany in the long run-up to the world cup that the country is hosting from june 9 to july 9 .
late last year the former referee was found guilty of fixing matches in a betting fraud worth two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.39 bill . -rrb- . hoyzer was sentenced last november to two years and five months for his role in the affair . linsi said that he believed that the hoyzer scandal in germany was an exception .
match-fixing reaches far beyond germany 's borders .
to fight this , fifa 's executive committee recently approved a task force report to investigate better preventative measures .
one method would be improved cooperation between fifa confederations and the national associations . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer chiefs deny schweinsteiger allegations german soccer chiefs on thursday issued a vehement denial of a newspaper claim that bayern munich star bastian schweinsteiger was the international footballer involved in a betting scandal .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .
" it 's good that we now have a movie like this , but it 's also good to have films that show the more positive side of life back then .
there were two sides , you know .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner .

" i 'd like to see iran do all they can to build confidence , " mohamed elbaradei , head of the international agency for atomic energy -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told reporters after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier when asked about the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and elbaradei met in berlin " i would like iran to do what they can right now to lower our doubts ... until negotiations resume , " said elbaradei , who also met german chancellor angela merkel during his stay in berlin . diplomats close to the un nuclear watchdog told afp saturday that iran could be running a 164-centrifuge pilot cascade to enrich uranium by the end of march or beginning of april .
at the pilot cascade in the iranian city of natanz , " there is just piping to be finished , then they do vacuum tests , then they would test with inert gas and finally they would put in uranium gas to begin the process , " said a diplomat close to the vienna-based iaea . the remarks came at a time when talks within the un security council on a statement calling iran to account for its suspected nuclear weapons activities have reached an impasse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear facility in isfahan in iran the united states and its allies charge that iran 's nuclear program conceals an effort to develop weapons and have urged it to halt sensitive uranium enrichment activities .
iran vehemently denies the charges , saying its research is peaceful and meant to provide fuel for its power plants . authorities uncover procurement network el baradei 's visit to berlin coincides with reports that german customs agents have discovered a network of entrepreneurs who were allegedly trying to buy material for the iranian nuclear program , state prosecutors said monday . some 250 agents raided 41 companies in 10 german states last week after learning of suspicious purchase requests by a berlin firm , which is no longer in business , the prosecutor 's office in potsdam , near the german capital said . " this involves the iranian atomic procurement program , " a spokesman told ard television .
" we have learned that the employees of this company approached companies in germany in a targeted way to buy construction parts for iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plutonium tablets at a nuclear facility in hanau , germany the searches revealed that six of the companies had done business with the berlin company but only one of the firms , from the western state of hesse , was under suspicion of violating export laws . the prosecutor 's office said that the deliveries went from the berlin company run by russians to a company near moscow , and from there to iran .
the shipments included electronic parts and special cables .
according to an ard report , the iranians had attempted to acquire hydraulic pumps and transformer parts in germany . a spokesman put the value of the deliveries at between two and three million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 and 3.6 million -rrb- two million euros were seized in the raid of the berlin business . strict export rules in germany the un nuclear watchdog has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us accusations that tehran is using its civilian nuclear power program to hide an atomic weapons program .
iran rejects the charges . the export of material that could be used in a nuclear program is subject to strict regulations in germany and must be approved by the authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discredited pakistani scientist also know as the " father of the pakistani bomb " a german engineer went on trial this month accused of helping libya 's attempts to develop nuclear weapons using technology supplied through the smuggling network of the disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan . he faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty by the court in the south-western city of mannheim . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german trial could shed light on global nuclear nexus the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .

-lrb- march 22 , 2006 -rrb- why the fight against terrorist financing is faltering the financing of international terrorism is notoriously hard to stop .
but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .

" i 'd like to see iran do all they can to build confidence , " mohamed elbaradei , head of the international agency for atomic energy -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told reporters after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier when asked about the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and elbaradei met in berlin " i would like iran to do what they can right now to lower our doubts ... until negotiations resume , " said elbaradei , who also met german chancellor angela merkel during his stay in berlin . diplomats close to the un nuclear watchdog told afp saturday that iran could be running a 164-centrifuge pilot cascade to enrich uranium by the end of march or beginning of april .
at the pilot cascade in the iranian city of natanz , " there is just piping to be finished , then they do vacuum tests , then they would test with inert gas and finally they would put in uranium gas to begin the process , " said a diplomat close to the vienna-based iaea . the remarks came at a time when talks within the un security council on a statement calling iran to account for its suspected nuclear weapons activities have reached an impasse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear facility in isfahan in iran the united states and its allies charge that iran 's nuclear program conceals an effort to develop weapons and have urged it to halt sensitive uranium enrichment activities .
iran vehemently denies the charges , saying its research is peaceful and meant to provide fuel for its power plants . authorities uncover procurement network el baradei 's visit to berlin coincides with reports that german customs agents have discovered a network of entrepreneurs who were allegedly trying to buy material for the iranian nuclear program , state prosecutors said monday . some 250 agents raided 41 companies in 10 german states last week after learning of suspicious purchase requests by a berlin firm , which is no longer in business , the prosecutor 's office in potsdam , near the german capital said . " this involves the iranian atomic procurement program , " a spokesman told ard television .
" we have learned that the employees of this company approached companies in germany in a targeted way to buy construction parts for iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plutonium tablets at a nuclear facility in hanau , germany the searches revealed that six of the companies had done business with the berlin company but only one of the firms , from the western state of hesse , was under suspicion of violating export laws . the prosecutor 's office said that the deliveries went from the berlin company run by russians to a company near moscow , and from there to iran .
the shipments included electronic parts and special cables .
according to an ard report , the iranians had attempted to acquire hydraulic pumps and transformer parts in germany . a spokesman put the value of the deliveries at between two and three million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 and 3.6 million -rrb- two million euros were seized in the raid of the berlin business . strict export rules in germany the un nuclear watchdog has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us accusations that tehran is using its civilian nuclear power program to hide an atomic weapons program .
iran rejects the charges . the export of material that could be used in a nuclear program is subject to strict regulations in germany and must be approved by the authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discredited pakistani scientist also know as the " father of the pakistani bomb " a german engineer went on trial this month accused of helping libya 's attempts to develop nuclear weapons using technology supplied through the smuggling network of the disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan . he faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty by the court in the south-western city of mannheim . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german trial could shed light on global nuclear nexus the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .

" we will work all day monday and maybe even a bit on tuesday , " yaroslav davydovych , the head of ukraine 's central election commission , told reporters . the regions party , headed by russia-friendly ex-premier viktor yanukovich , led with 24.58 percent , " orange revolution " heroine yulia tymoshenko 's bloc had 24.08 percent , and president viktor yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc was in third with 17.01 percent , the preliminary results showed .

the then-opposition leader easily won a rerun ballot but his popularity has plummeted as the economy slumped and the " orange " team splintered amid infighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko could become prime minister once more the president 's apparent poor showing in sunday 's poll will push him towards a coalition with tymoshenko , analysts agreed early monday , while officials from the two parties suggested an agreement could be signed later in the day .

tymoshenko , too , downplayed the regions victory , saying an " orange " coalition would relegate yanukovich 's party to an opposition role in the new parliament . " this is absolutely okay .
the country needs a strong opposition , " timoshenko said in early morning televised remarks .
tymoshenko looks set to regain the premiership in a coalition with our ukraine . " our ukraine has agreed on the position that the force that gets the most votes ... will propose its candidacy for the prime minister 's post , " said roman bezsmertnyi , campaign chief for our ukraine . when asked what would happen if yushchenko refused her candidacy for the premiership , tymoshenko said in televised comments : " he would have to agree to the premiership of -lrb- viktor -rrb- yanukovich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich appears to be on the way up again such a coalition would allow yushchenko to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward membership in the european union and the nato , analysts said . but an alliance between the president and his erstwhile " orange " partner is likely to be a tense one , as the ambitious tymoshenko and measured yushchenko are likely to spar on several issues , analysts say .
these include a recent gas deal with russia , which tymoshenko has demanded be scrapped ; reviewing questionable privatizations , which she has vowed to pursue despite investor unease ; and intervention in the economy , which free market-oriented yushchenko opposes . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

" i 'd like to see iran do all they can to build confidence , " mohamed elbaradei , head of the international agency for atomic energy -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told reporters after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier when asked about the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and elbaradei met in berlin " i would like iran to do what they can right now to lower our doubts ... until negotiations resume , " said elbaradei , who also met german chancellor angela merkel during his stay in berlin . diplomats close to the un nuclear watchdog told afp saturday that iran could be running a 164-centrifuge pilot cascade to enrich uranium by the end of march or beginning of april .
at the pilot cascade in the iranian city of natanz , " there is just piping to be finished , then they do vacuum tests , then they would test with inert gas and finally they would put in uranium gas to begin the process , " said a diplomat close to the vienna-based iaea . the remarks came at a time when talks within the un security council on a statement calling iran to account for its suspected nuclear weapons activities have reached an impasse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear facility in isfahan in iran the united states and its allies charge that iran 's nuclear program conceals an effort to develop weapons and have urged it to halt sensitive uranium enrichment activities .
iran vehemently denies the charges , saying its research is peaceful and meant to provide fuel for its power plants . authorities uncover procurement network el baradei 's visit to berlin coincides with reports that german customs agents have discovered a network of entrepreneurs who were allegedly trying to buy material for the iranian nuclear program , state prosecutors said monday . some 250 agents raided 41 companies in 10 german states last week after learning of suspicious purchase requests by a berlin firm , which is no longer in business , the prosecutor 's office in potsdam , near the german capital said . " this involves the iranian atomic procurement program , " a spokesman told ard television .
" we have learned that the employees of this company approached companies in germany in a targeted way to buy construction parts for iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plutonium tablets at a nuclear facility in hanau , germany the searches revealed that six of the companies had done business with the berlin company but only one of the firms , from the western state of hesse , was under suspicion of violating export laws . the prosecutor 's office said that the deliveries went from the berlin company run by russians to a company near moscow , and from there to iran .
the shipments included electronic parts and special cables .
according to an ard report , the iranians had attempted to acquire hydraulic pumps and transformer parts in germany . a spokesman put the value of the deliveries at between two and three million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 and 3.6 million -rrb- two million euros were seized in the raid of the berlin business . strict export rules in germany the un nuclear watchdog has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us accusations that tehran is using its civilian nuclear power program to hide an atomic weapons program .
iran rejects the charges . the export of material that could be used in a nuclear program is subject to strict regulations in germany and must be approved by the authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discredited pakistani scientist also know as the " father of the pakistani bomb " a german engineer went on trial this month accused of helping libya 's attempts to develop nuclear weapons using technology supplied through the smuggling network of the disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan . he faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty by the court in the south-western city of mannheim . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german trial could shed light on global nuclear nexus the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .

while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.

" spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .

that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .

" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .
" it 's good that we now have a movie like this , but it 's also good to have films that show the more positive side of life back then .

" i see the outcome as an affirmation of what the grand coalition has accomplished until now and encouragement for the steps ahead , " merkel told reporters at her party headquarters on monday .
" we will put issues on the agenda .
tough working weeks lie ahead of us . " observers from across the political spectrum said it was now time after the coalition 's extended political honeymoon for it to face up to daunting problems including the ailing health care system , the 12-percent jobless rate and the overhaul of the creaking federal system . " everybody feels like a winner , " political analyst peter lösche told rolling news channel n24 .
" now they can get on with the business of governing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt faces a tough time with her reforms merkel presented a long list of policy initiatives for the " second stage " of her term focusing on reform of the federal system , family policy , health care , government red tape , energy policy , the labor market and corporate taxes . the chancellor was due to meet health minister ulla schmidt later on monday to prepare cross-party talks scheduled for wednesday on health-care reform , according to government sources .
both coalition parties have pledged to narrow their differences on health care before parliament 's two-month summer recess , which begins on july 7 . press demand action , reserve judgement on merkel 's credentials commenting on merkel ’ s " phased " chancellorship ; the center-left berliner zeitung said the first stage had been dominated by confidence-building between the coalition parties but that the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition .
but also that they expect something of it .
the clear outcome of the poll is an order to begin in earnest with the work at hand , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and müntefering : " you hum it , i 'll play it " in germany ’ s neighbor , the vienna-based die presse said that merkel was facing her last chance to finally get to grips with urgently needed reforms .
so far the coalition 's performance , it says , has all the " soporific dynamism of a jazz bar session after midnight , with angela merkel softly stroking the drums with a little brush and -lrb- her spd deputy -rrb- franz müntefering plucking leisurely at the bass " . die presse added that the coalition parties , says the paper , will have to " step up their tempo considerably " as germany 's honeymoon with the new chancellor may only last a few more months .
" the credit she accumulated recently with her feel-good governing style and her faultless round of the world 's red carpets could be used up very quickly , " it warned . the frankfurter rundschau warned that now the state elections were over , the coalition has " lost its only remaining excuse " for not tackling controversial issues .
" it is no longer enough to make a good impression at home and abroad - action is needed now , " the paper insisted . the süddeutsche zeitung called merkel 's coalition a " complex mobile " which " starts to tremble with every draught , swings up and down if there is a wind and gets tangled up in a storm . "
while merkel has surprised people home and abroad with her unexpected popularity and respect " she has done so not through her actions , but through her failure to act ... she has only been a half chancellor , " it concluded . both sides of coalition relieved at election results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was pleased platzeck 's spd did n't cause any ructions however , despite the fact that the elections seemed to open possible floodgates of criticism , both governing parties in the coalition - traditional rivals - said the shared triumphs helped secure the balance of power in the " grand coalition " in berlin .
merkel had feared a debacle for the social democrats could destabilize the alliance . " i am pleased as the chairman of the german social democrats that i am able to welcome election victories in state polls , " matthias platzeck said .
he was referring to a string of state poll defeats for the social democrats which prompted merkel 's predecessor chancellor gerhard schröder to call for new elections which set the wheels in motion for his ouster . in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , the prosperous home of auto giants daimlerchrysler and porsche , the conservatives captured 44.2 percent of the vote , according to provisional official figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were favorable ; the turnout was n't the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats . voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party which won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21.4 percent . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . healthy results but poor voter turnout they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt and a pure social democrat government in rhineland-palatinate would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , meaning the free democrats have little power to block legislation . total electoral turnout in the three states , however , was only about 60 percent , a historic low . the leader of the opposition greens party claudia roth said the grand coalition was leading to " depoliticization " - turning voters off the political process . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state elections keep premiers in place conservatives and social democrats held on to power in three german state polls sunday , signaling good news for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

" observers from across the political spectrum said it was now time after the coalition 's extended political honeymoon for it to face up to daunting problems including the ailing health care system , the 12-percent jobless rate and the overhaul of the creaking federal system . " everybody feels like a winner , " political analyst peter lösche told rolling news channel n24 .
" now they can get on with the business of governing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt faces a tough time with her reforms merkel presented a long list of policy initiatives for the " second stage " of her term focusing on reform of the federal system , family policy , health care , government red tape , energy policy , the labor market and corporate taxes . the chancellor was due to meet health minister ulla schmidt later on monday to prepare cross-party talks scheduled for wednesday on health-care reform , according to government sources .
both coalition parties have pledged to narrow their differences on health care before parliament 's two-month summer recess , which begins on july 7 . press demand action , reserve judgement on merkel 's credentials commenting on merkel ’ s " phased " chancellorship ; the center-left berliner zeitung said the first stage had been dominated by confidence-building between the coalition parties but that the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition .
but also that they expect something of it .
the clear outcome of the poll is an order to begin in earnest with the work at hand , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and müntefering : " you hum it , i 'll play it " in germany ’ s neighbor , the vienna-based die presse said that merkel was facing her last chance to finally get to grips with urgently needed reforms .
so far the coalition 's performance , it says , has all the " soporific dynamism of a jazz bar session after midnight , with angela merkel softly stroking the drums with a little brush and -lrb- her spd deputy -rrb- franz müntefering plucking leisurely at the bass " . die presse added that the coalition parties , says the paper , will have to " step up their tempo considerably " as germany 's honeymoon with the new chancellor may only last a few more months .
" the credit she accumulated recently with her feel-good governing style and her faultless round of the world 's red carpets could be used up very quickly , " it warned . the frankfurter rundschau warned that now the state elections were over , the coalition has " lost its only remaining excuse " for not tackling controversial issues .
" it is no longer enough to make a good impression at home and abroad - action is needed now , " the paper insisted . the süddeutsche zeitung called merkel 's coalition a " complex mobile " which " starts to tremble with every draught , swings up and down if there is a wind and gets tangled up in a storm . "
while merkel has surprised people home and abroad with her unexpected popularity and respect " she has done so not through her actions , but through her failure to act ... she has only been a half chancellor , " it concluded . both sides of coalition relieved at election results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was pleased platzeck 's spd did n't cause any ructions however , despite the fact that the elections seemed to open possible floodgates of criticism , both governing parties in the coalition - traditional rivals - said the shared triumphs helped secure the balance of power in the " grand coalition " in berlin .
merkel had feared a debacle for the social democrats could destabilize the alliance . " i am pleased as the chairman of the german social democrats that i am able to welcome election victories in state polls , " matthias platzeck said .
he was referring to a string of state poll defeats for the social democrats which prompted merkel 's predecessor chancellor gerhard schröder to call for new elections which set the wheels in motion for his ouster . in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , the prosperous home of auto giants daimlerchrysler and porsche , the conservatives captured 44.2 percent of the vote , according to provisional official figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were favorable ; the turnout was n't the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats . voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party which won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21.4 percent . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . healthy results but poor voter turnout they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt and a pure social democrat government in rhineland-palatinate would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , meaning the free democrats have little power to block legislation . total electoral turnout in the three states , however , was only about 60 percent , a historic low . the leader of the opposition greens party claudia roth said the grand coalition was leading to " depoliticization " - turning voters off the political process . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state elections keep premiers in place conservatives and social democrats held on to power in three german state polls sunday , signaling good news for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns . fifa early warning system gmbh might more resemble the name of an anti-terror company .
the matter of possible terrorist attacks is not being neglected by anyone involved with the world cup , but early warning system gmbh has another mission - the prevention of illegal betting operations . speaking to reporters on friday at the conclusion of a four-day workshop for world cup referee candidates , fifa 's general secretary urs linsi said the company was created back in january 2006 as a response to the robert hoyzer betting scandal that broke in germany last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen -lrb- red -rrb- was possibly at center of manipulation in 2002-03 that is not the only scandal that has come to the surface in germany .
state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .
early warning system will be cooperating with companies that specialize in spotting what could be potential attempts at manipulating games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer 's involvement in match-fixing started an avalanche in german soccer " i think we 've taken the necessary steps to prevent match-fixing .
and this is not just for the world cup , " linsi said . the hoyzer scandal was a huge embarrassment to germany in the long run-up to the world cup that the country is hosting from june 9 to july 9 .
late last year the former referee was found guilty of fixing matches in a betting fraud worth two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.39 bill . -rrb- . hoyzer was sentenced last november to two years and five months for his role in the affair . linsi said that he believed that the hoyzer scandal in germany was an exception .
match-fixing reaches far beyond germany 's borders .
to fight this , fifa 's executive committee recently approved a task force report to investigate better preventative measures .
one method would be improved cooperation between fifa confederations and the national associations . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer chiefs deny schweinsteiger allegations german soccer chiefs on thursday issued a vehement denial of a newspaper claim that bayern munich star bastian schweinsteiger was the international footballer involved in a betting scandal .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .

1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

still , vintners worry about what the future may bring . it 's a good time for german wine .
exports increased last year to 475 million euros -lrb- $ 569 million -rrb- , 10 percent more than the previous year and the highest level they 've been at since 1985 when an austrian wine scandal had a devastating knock-on effect in germany .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns . fifa early warning system gmbh might more resemble the name of an anti-terror company .
the matter of possible terrorist attacks is not being neglected by anyone involved with the world cup , but early warning system gmbh has another mission - the prevention of illegal betting operations . speaking to reporters on friday at the conclusion of a four-day workshop for world cup referee candidates , fifa 's general secretary urs linsi said the company was created back in january 2006 as a response to the robert hoyzer betting scandal that broke in germany last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen -lrb- red -rrb- was possibly at center of manipulation in 2002-03 that is not the only scandal that has come to the surface in germany .
state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .
early warning system will be cooperating with companies that specialize in spotting what could be potential attempts at manipulating games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer 's involvement in match-fixing started an avalanche in german soccer " i think we 've taken the necessary steps to prevent match-fixing .
and this is not just for the world cup , " linsi said . the hoyzer scandal was a huge embarrassment to germany in the long run-up to the world cup that the country is hosting from june 9 to july 9 .
late last year the former referee was found guilty of fixing matches in a betting fraud worth two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.39 bill . -rrb- . hoyzer was sentenced last november to two years and five months for his role in the affair . linsi said that he believed that the hoyzer scandal in germany was an exception .
match-fixing reaches far beyond germany 's borders .
to fight this , fifa 's executive committee recently approved a task force report to investigate better preventative measures .
one method would be improved cooperation between fifa confederations and the national associations . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer chiefs deny schweinsteiger allegations german soccer chiefs on thursday issued a vehement denial of a newspaper claim that bayern munich star bastian schweinsteiger was the international footballer involved in a betting scandal .

the gbl stake is reportedly worth four to five million euros .
the sources said the plans are at an early stage . as well as the stake in sony bmg - the new york-based joint venture of bertelsmann and japan 's sony - the german group is considering selling its wholly-owned bmg music publishing business , the ft said . together , the music companies reported revenues of 2.1 billion euros last year , down 16.5 percent as cd sales fell , the report said . bertelsma n n ow n ers oppose public offeri n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen gunter thielen , bertelsmann 's chief executive , said last week the company would not decide about any moves until it knew more about the intentions of gbl , which has the right to place its stake in bertelsmann from may , potentially leading to an initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- .
but he did not rule out selling the music companies . bertelsmann , which owns european broadcaster rtl and book publisher random house among other businesses , is privately owned by the mohn family .

" i 'd like to see iran do all they can to build confidence , " mohamed elbaradei , head of the international agency for atomic energy -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told reporters after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier when asked about the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and elbaradei met in berlin " i would like iran to do what they can right now to lower our doubts ... until negotiations resume , " said elbaradei , who also met german chancellor angela merkel during his stay in berlin . diplomats close to the un nuclear watchdog told afp saturday that iran could be running a 164-centrifuge pilot cascade to enrich uranium by the end of march or beginning of april .
at the pilot cascade in the iranian city of natanz , " there is just piping to be finished , then they do vacuum tests , then they would test with inert gas and finally they would put in uranium gas to begin the process , " said a diplomat close to the vienna-based iaea . the remarks came at a time when talks within the un security council on a statement calling iran to account for its suspected nuclear weapons activities have reached an impasse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear facility in isfahan in iran the united states and its allies charge that iran 's nuclear program conceals an effort to develop weapons and have urged it to halt sensitive uranium enrichment activities .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

" we will work all day monday and maybe even a bit on tuesday , " yaroslav davydovych , the head of ukraine 's central election commission , told reporters . the regions party , headed by russia-friendly ex-premier viktor yanukovich , led with 24.58 percent , " orange revolution " heroine yulia tymoshenko 's bloc had 24.08 percent , and president viktor yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc was in third with 17.01 percent , the preliminary results showed .
exit polls released after the close of voting sunday suggested regions would get 31 percent of the overall vote , timoshenko 's bloc 24 percent , and our ukraine would be third with 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were bad news for president viktor yushchenko the polls showed that two other parties were likely to get more than the 3 percent of the general vote required to get into parliament - the socialists with 5 percent and the communists with 3 percent . mandate for opponents " the results are the ukrainian population 's evaluation of ...

they have given their mandate to his opponents , " said kost bondarenko , a political analyst in kiev . yushchenko was swept into power after the 2004 " orange revolution " street protests over a contested presidential ballot , amid which the nation 's supreme court threw out the results that initially handed victory to yanukovich .
the then-opposition leader easily won a rerun ballot but his popularity has plummeted as the economy slumped and the " orange " team splintered amid infighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko could become prime minister once more the president 's apparent poor showing in sunday 's poll will push him towards a coalition with tymoshenko , analysts agreed early monday , while officials from the two parties suggested an agreement could be signed later in the day . " the most probable coalition will be orange ... the region party 's victory is only a formal one , " said volodymyr fesenko , an independent analyst . " this is a blow for yushchenko , but not defeat , " said bondarenko . timoshenko or yanukovich as premier ?
tymoshenko , too , downplayed the regions victory , saying an " orange " coalition would relegate yanukovich 's party to an opposition role in the new parliament . " this is absolutely okay .
the country needs a strong opposition , " timoshenko said in early morning televised remarks .
tymoshenko looks set to regain the premiership in a coalition with our ukraine . " our ukraine has agreed on the position that the force that gets the most votes ... will propose its candidacy for the prime minister 's post , " said roman bezsmertnyi , campaign chief for our ukraine . when asked what would happen if yushchenko refused her candidacy for the premiership , tymoshenko said in televised comments : " he would have to agree to the premiership of -lrb- viktor -rrb- yanukovich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich appears to be on the way up again such a coalition would allow yushchenko to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward membership in the european union and the nato , analysts said . but an alliance between the president and his erstwhile " orange " partner is likely to be a tense one , as the ambitious tymoshenko and measured yushchenko are likely to spar on several issues , analysts say .
these include a recent gas deal with russia , which tymoshenko has demanded be scrapped ; reviewing questionable privatizations , which she has vowed to pursue despite investor unease ; and intervention in the economy , which free market-oriented yushchenko opposes . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns . fifa early warning system gmbh might more resemble the name of an anti-terror company .
the matter of possible terrorist attacks is not being neglected by anyone involved with the world cup , but early warning system gmbh has another mission - the prevention of illegal betting operations . speaking to reporters on friday at the conclusion of a four-day workshop for world cup referee candidates , fifa 's general secretary urs linsi said the company was created back in january 2006 as a response to the robert hoyzer betting scandal that broke in germany last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen -lrb- red -rrb- was possibly at center of manipulation in 2002-03 that is not the only scandal that has come to the surface in germany .
state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .
early warning system will be cooperating with companies that specialize in spotting what could be potential attempts at manipulating games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer 's involvement in match-fixing started an avalanche in german soccer " i think we 've taken the necessary steps to prevent match-fixing .
and this is not just for the world cup , " linsi said . the hoyzer scandal was a huge embarrassment to germany in the long run-up to the world cup that the country is hosting from june 9 to july 9 .
late last year the former referee was found guilty of fixing matches in a betting fraud worth two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.39 bill . -rrb- . hoyzer was sentenced last november to two years and five months for his role in the affair . linsi said that he believed that the hoyzer scandal in germany was an exception .
match-fixing reaches far beyond germany 's borders .
to fight this , fifa 's executive committee recently approved a task force report to investigate better preventative measures .
one method would be improved cooperation between fifa confederations and the national associations . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer chiefs deny schweinsteiger allegations german soccer chiefs on thursday issued a vehement denial of a newspaper claim that bayern munich star bastian schweinsteiger was the international footballer involved in a betting scandal .

" we will work all day monday and maybe even a bit on tuesday , " yaroslav davydovych , the head of ukraine 's central election commission , told reporters . the regions party , headed by russia-friendly ex-premier viktor yanukovich , led with 24.58 percent , " orange revolution " heroine yulia tymoshenko 's bloc had 24.08 percent , and president viktor yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc was in third with 17.01 percent , the preliminary results showed .

" this is a blow for yushchenko , but not defeat , " said bondarenko . timoshenko or yanukovich as premier ?
tymoshenko , too , downplayed the regions victory , saying an " orange " coalition would relegate yanukovich 's party to an opposition role in the new parliament . " this is absolutely okay .
the country needs a strong opposition , " timoshenko said in early morning televised remarks .
tymoshenko looks set to regain the premiership in a coalition with our ukraine . " our ukraine has agreed on the position that the force that gets the most votes ... will propose its candidacy for the prime minister 's post , " said roman bezsmertnyi , campaign chief for our ukraine . when asked what would happen if yushchenko refused her candidacy for the premiership , tymoshenko said in televised comments : " he would have to agree to the premiership of -lrb- viktor -rrb- yanukovich .

these include a recent gas deal with russia , which tymoshenko has demanded be scrapped ; reviewing questionable privatizations , which she has vowed to pursue despite investor unease ; and intervention in the economy , which free market-oriented yushchenko opposes . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

" i see the outcome as an affirmation of what the grand coalition has accomplished until now and encouragement for the steps ahead , " merkel told reporters at her party headquarters on monday .
" we will put issues on the agenda .
tough working weeks lie ahead of us . " observers from across the political spectrum said it was now time after the coalition 's extended political honeymoon for it to face up to daunting problems including the ailing health care system , the 12-percent jobless rate and the overhaul of the creaking federal system . " everybody feels like a winner , " political analyst peter lösche told rolling news channel n24 .
" now they can get on with the business of governing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt faces a tough time with her reforms merkel presented a long list of policy initiatives for the " second stage " of her term focusing on reform of the federal system , family policy , health care , government red tape , energy policy , the labor market and corporate taxes . the chancellor was due to meet health minister ulla schmidt later on monday to prepare cross-party talks scheduled for wednesday on health-care reform , according to government sources .
both coalition parties have pledged to narrow their differences on health care before parliament 's two-month summer recess , which begins on july 7 . press demand action , reserve judgement on merkel 's credentials commenting on merkel ’ s " phased " chancellorship ; the center-left berliner zeitung said the first stage had been dominated by confidence-building between the coalition parties but that the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition .
but also that they expect something of it .
the clear outcome of the poll is an order to begin in earnest with the work at hand , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and müntefering : " you hum it , i 'll play it " in germany ’ s neighbor , the vienna-based die presse said that merkel was facing her last chance to finally get to grips with urgently needed reforms .
so far the coalition 's performance , it says , has all the " soporific dynamism of a jazz bar session after midnight , with angela merkel softly stroking the drums with a little brush and -lrb- her spd deputy -rrb- franz müntefering plucking leisurely at the bass " . die presse added that the coalition parties , says the paper , will have to " step up their tempo considerably " as germany 's honeymoon with the new chancellor may only last a few more months .
" the credit she accumulated recently with her feel-good governing style and her faultless round of the world 's red carpets could be used up very quickly , " it warned . the frankfurter rundschau warned that now the state elections were over , the coalition has " lost its only remaining excuse " for not tackling controversial issues .
" it is no longer enough to make a good impression at home and abroad - action is needed now , " the paper insisted . the süddeutsche zeitung called merkel 's coalition a " complex mobile " which " starts to tremble with every draught , swings up and down if there is a wind and gets tangled up in a storm . "
while merkel has surprised people home and abroad with her unexpected popularity and respect " she has done so not through her actions , but through her failure to act ... she has only been a half chancellor , " it concluded . both sides of coalition relieved at election results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was pleased platzeck 's spd did n't cause any ructions however , despite the fact that the elections seemed to open possible floodgates of criticism , both governing parties in the coalition - traditional rivals - said the shared triumphs helped secure the balance of power in the " grand coalition " in berlin .
merkel had feared a debacle for the social democrats could destabilize the alliance . " i am pleased as the chairman of the german social democrats that i am able to welcome election victories in state polls , " matthias platzeck said .
he was referring to a string of state poll defeats for the social democrats which prompted merkel 's predecessor chancellor gerhard schröder to call for new elections which set the wheels in motion for his ouster . in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , the prosperous home of auto giants daimlerchrysler and porsche , the conservatives captured 44.2 percent of the vote , according to provisional official figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were favorable ; the turnout was n't the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats . voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party which won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21.4 percent . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . healthy results but poor voter turnout they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt and a pure social democrat government in rhineland-palatinate would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , meaning the free democrats have little power to block legislation . total electoral turnout in the three states , however , was only about 60 percent , a historic low . the leader of the opposition greens party claudia roth said the grand coalition was leading to " depoliticization " - turning voters off the political process . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state elections keep premiers in place conservatives and social democrats held on to power in three german state polls sunday , signaling good news for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

" i see the outcome as an affirmation of what the grand coalition has accomplished until now and encouragement for the steps ahead , " merkel told reporters at her party headquarters on monday .
" we will put issues on the agenda .
tough working weeks lie ahead of us . " observers from across the political spectrum said it was now time after the coalition 's extended political honeymoon for it to face up to daunting problems including the ailing health care system , the 12-percent jobless rate and the overhaul of the creaking federal system . " everybody feels like a winner , " political analyst peter lösche told rolling news channel n24 .
" now they can get on with the business of governing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt faces a tough time with her reforms merkel presented a long list of policy initiatives for the " second stage " of her term focusing on reform of the federal system , family policy , health care , government red tape , energy policy , the labor market and corporate taxes . the chancellor was due to meet health minister ulla schmidt later on monday to prepare cross-party talks scheduled for wednesday on health-care reform , according to government sources .
both coalition parties have pledged to narrow their differences on health care before parliament 's two-month summer recess , which begins on july 7 . press demand action , reserve judgement on merkel 's credentials commenting on merkel ’ s " phased " chancellorship ; the center-left berliner zeitung said the first stage had been dominated by confidence-building between the coalition parties but that the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition .
but also that they expect something of it .
the clear outcome of the poll is an order to begin in earnest with the work at hand , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and müntefering : " you hum it , i 'll play it " in germany ’ s neighbor , the vienna-based die presse said that merkel was facing her last chance to finally get to grips with urgently needed reforms .
so far the coalition 's performance , it says , has all the " soporific dynamism of a jazz bar session after midnight , with angela merkel softly stroking the drums with a little brush and -lrb- her spd deputy -rrb- franz müntefering plucking leisurely at the bass " . die presse added that the coalition parties , says the paper , will have to " step up their tempo considerably " as germany 's honeymoon with the new chancellor may only last a few more months .
" the credit she accumulated recently with her feel-good governing style and her faultless round of the world 's red carpets could be used up very quickly , " it warned . the frankfurter rundschau warned that now the state elections were over , the coalition has " lost its only remaining excuse " for not tackling controversial issues .
" it is no longer enough to make a good impression at home and abroad - action is needed now , " the paper insisted . the süddeutsche zeitung called merkel 's coalition a " complex mobile " which " starts to tremble with every draught , swings up and down if there is a wind and gets tangled up in a storm . "
while merkel has surprised people home and abroad with her unexpected popularity and respect " she has done so not through her actions , but through her failure to act ... she has only been a half chancellor , " it concluded . both sides of coalition relieved at election results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was pleased platzeck 's spd did n't cause any ructions however , despite the fact that the elections seemed to open possible floodgates of criticism , both governing parties in the coalition - traditional rivals - said the shared triumphs helped secure the balance of power in the " grand coalition " in berlin .
merkel had feared a debacle for the social democrats could destabilize the alliance . " i am pleased as the chairman of the german social democrats that i am able to welcome election victories in state polls , " matthias platzeck said .
he was referring to a string of state poll defeats for the social democrats which prompted merkel 's predecessor chancellor gerhard schröder to call for new elections which set the wheels in motion for his ouster . in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , the prosperous home of auto giants daimlerchrysler and porsche , the conservatives captured 44.2 percent of the vote , according to provisional official figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were favorable ; the turnout was n't the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats . voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party which won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21.4 percent . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . healthy results but poor voter turnout they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt and a pure social democrat government in rhineland-palatinate would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , meaning the free democrats have little power to block legislation . total electoral turnout in the three states , however , was only about 60 percent , a historic low . the leader of the opposition greens party claudia roth said the grand coalition was leading to " depoliticization " - turning voters off the political process . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state elections keep premiers in place conservatives and social democrats held on to power in three german state polls sunday , signaling good news for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .
early warning system will be cooperating with companies that specialize in spotting what could be potential attempts at manipulating games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer 's involvement in match-fixing started an avalanche in german soccer " i think we 've taken the necessary steps to prevent match-fixing .
and this is not just for the world cup , " linsi said . the hoyzer scandal was a huge embarrassment to germany in the long run-up to the world cup that the country is hosting from june 9 to july 9 .
late last year the former referee was found guilty of fixing matches in a betting fraud worth two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.39 bill . -rrb- . hoyzer was sentenced last november to two years and five months for his role in the affair . linsi said that he believed that the hoyzer scandal in germany was an exception .
match-fixing reaches far beyond germany 's borders .
to fight this , fifa 's executive committee recently approved a task force report to investigate better preventative measures .
one method would be improved cooperation between fifa confederations and the national associations . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer chiefs deny schweinsteiger allegations german soccer chiefs on thursday issued a vehement denial of a newspaper claim that bayern munich star bastian schweinsteiger was the international footballer involved in a betting scandal .

" recovery is going to take years .
fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .

steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .

" i 'd like to see iran do all they can to build confidence , " mohamed elbaradei , head of the international agency for atomic energy -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told reporters after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier when asked about the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and elbaradei met in berlin " i would like iran to do what they can right now to lower our doubts ... until negotiations resume , " said elbaradei , who also met german chancellor angela merkel during his stay in berlin . diplomats close to the un nuclear watchdog told afp saturday that iran could be running a 164-centrifuge pilot cascade to enrich uranium by the end of march or beginning of april .
at the pilot cascade in the iranian city of natanz , " there is just piping to be finished , then they do vacuum tests , then they would test with inert gas and finally they would put in uranium gas to begin the process , " said a diplomat close to the vienna-based iaea . the remarks came at a time when talks within the un security council on a statement calling iran to account for its suspected nuclear weapons activities have reached an impasse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear facility in isfahan in iran the united states and its allies charge that iran 's nuclear program conceals an effort to develop weapons and have urged it to halt sensitive uranium enrichment activities .

the shipments included electronic parts and special cables .

" i 'd like to see iran do all they can to build confidence , " mohamed elbaradei , head of the international agency for atomic energy -lrb- iaea -rrb- , told reporters after talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier when asked about the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and elbaradei met in berlin " i would like iran to do what they can right now to lower our doubts ... until negotiations resume , " said elbaradei , who also met german chancellor angela merkel during his stay in berlin . diplomats close to the un nuclear watchdog told afp saturday that iran could be running a 164-centrifuge pilot cascade to enrich uranium by the end of march or beginning of april .
at the pilot cascade in the iranian city of natanz , " there is just piping to be finished , then they do vacuum tests , then they would test with inert gas and finally they would put in uranium gas to begin the process , " said a diplomat close to the vienna-based iaea . the remarks came at a time when talks within the un security council on a statement calling iran to account for its suspected nuclear weapons activities have reached an impasse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nuclear facility in isfahan in iran the united states and its allies charge that iran 's nuclear program conceals an effort to develop weapons and have urged it to halt sensitive uranium enrichment activities .
iran vehemently denies the charges , saying its research is peaceful and meant to provide fuel for its power plants . authorities uncover procurement network el baradei 's visit to berlin coincides with reports that german customs agents have discovered a network of entrepreneurs who were allegedly trying to buy material for the iranian nuclear program , state prosecutors said monday . some 250 agents raided 41 companies in 10 german states last week after learning of suspicious purchase requests by a berlin firm , which is no longer in business , the prosecutor 's office in potsdam , near the german capital said . " this involves the iranian atomic procurement program , " a spokesman told ard television .

the shipments included electronic parts and special cables .
according to an ard report , the iranians had attempted to acquire hydraulic pumps and transformer parts in germany . a spokesman put the value of the deliveries at between two and three million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 and 3.6 million -rrb- two million euros were seized in the raid of the berlin business . strict export rules in germany the un nuclear watchdog has been investigating iran since february 2003 on us accusations that tehran is using its civilian nuclear power program to hide an atomic weapons program .
iran rejects the charges . the export of material that could be used in a nuclear program is subject to strict regulations in germany and must be approved by the authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discredited pakistani scientist also know as the " father of the pakistani bomb " a german engineer went on trial this month accused of helping libya 's attempts to develop nuclear weapons using technology supplied through the smuggling network of the disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan . he faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty by the court in the south-western city of mannheim . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german trial could shed light on global nuclear nexus the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .

" recovery is going to take years .
fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .
" there was no early warning system and now we are all living with the results , " clinton said .

steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .
he said video footage shot during the tsunami showed a settlement leaving their homes and running for high ground , from where they saw their possessions being washing away by the tsunami .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns . fifa early warning system gmbh might more resemble the name of an anti-terror company .
the matter of possible terrorist attacks is not being neglected by anyone involved with the world cup , but early warning system gmbh has another mission - the prevention of illegal betting operations . speaking to reporters on friday at the conclusion of a four-day workshop for world cup referee candidates , fifa 's general secretary urs linsi said the company was created back in january 2006 as a response to the robert hoyzer betting scandal that broke in germany last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen -lrb- red -rrb- was possibly at center of manipulation in 2002-03 that is not the only scandal that has come to the surface in germany .
state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .
early warning system will be cooperating with companies that specialize in spotting what could be potential attempts at manipulating games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer 's involvement in match-fixing started an avalanche in german soccer " i think we 've taken the necessary steps to prevent match-fixing .

" i see the outcome as an affirmation of what the grand coalition has accomplished until now and encouragement for the steps ahead , " merkel told reporters at her party headquarters on monday .
" we will put issues on the agenda .
tough working weeks lie ahead of us .

still , vintners worry about what the future may bring . it 's a good time for german wine .
exports increased last year to 475 million euros -lrb- $ 569 million -rrb- , 10 percent more than the previous year and the highest level they 've been at since 1985 when an austrian wine scandal had a devastating knock-on effect in germany .
britain remains german wine 's biggest importer followed by the us and the netherlands .
and consumers have been devoting more attention to germany 's top wines , riesling above all . " the aficionados are in america first and foremost , " said prince michael zu salm-salm , head of germany 's fine wine association vdp .
" a riesling boom is underway in the united states , a real renaissance .
but the aficionados are also in southern europe .
in italy , in spain we 're gaining momentum dramatically .
and we can truly say that it 's a development that 's beginning to have a worldwide effect . " the success of riesling does n't merely have to do with the grape 's flavor , but also with the increasing number of foreign journalists who give german wine good marks , particularly wine guru robert parker . trouble brewing ? despite the boom in exports , german vintners are troubled by a recent addition to a winemaking agreement between the european union and the united states .
a coda to the accord , added in march , allows the americans to export wines to europe that have been chemically and physically treated using controversial techniques that are largely prohibited in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince zu salm-salm speaks for germany 's quality wine producers " there are two critical points to the agreement , " said monika christmann , an expert on cellar techniques at geisenheim technical college .
" for one , that all future techniques , that do n't yet even exist , have been approved .
that means that we must accept everything that comes from america in the future , and with that , the americans practically set the standard worldwide .
the second critical point is that an integral part of the agreement is that all these techniques can be employed without declaring it on the label . " thus , consumers wo n't be able to tell how a wine was treated and whether a wine labelled as having been produced " according to the manner of a johannisberg riesling " is indeed a johannisberg riesling . power of the purse two figures are crucial in order to understand why the eu agriculture ministers agreed to the deal : us wine exports to the eu were worth $ 325 million in 2005 , while eu exports to the us were valued at $ 2.6 billion . but the agreement has caused quite a bit of hysteria in europe , with a plethora of newspaper articles upbraiding so-called artificial or plastic wines from the us , and largely demonstrating ignorance of the facts .
politicians from the german neo-nazi npd party also took advantage of the controversy to promote anti-american sentiments with their slogan " german wine instead of american rotgut . "
german vintners ended up feeling like they had to defend the us at the same time as criticizing it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in cellar techniques have some vintners worried " the fact is , all over the world there are vintners who are craftsmen like us , said zu salm-salm .
" and in europe , too , there are companies that are more used to working industrially . " " in america , it 's basically accepted - not in california , but in other parts of america - to add water to wine or to separate it with spinning doctor machines and then reconstruct it .
naturally , that goes entirely against our understanding of wine . ...
we 're opposed to the wine trade agreement and demand that improvements are made to it , " he said . the deadline for changes to the deal ends in three months .
by then it will be clear whether german vintners can save their designations of origin and whether it will become obligatory to declare particular cellar techniques .
but neither outcome is likely . günther birkenstock -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sour over us-eu wine deal the eu has approved a transatlantic deal opening the glutted european wine market to imports from the us .

" we will work all day monday and maybe even a bit on tuesday , " yaroslav davydovych , the head of ukraine 's central election commission , told reporters . the regions party , headed by russia-friendly ex-premier viktor yanukovich , led with 24.58 percent , " orange revolution " heroine yulia tymoshenko 's bloc had 24.08 percent , and president viktor yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc was in third with 17.01 percent , the preliminary results showed .
exit polls released after the close of voting sunday suggested regions would get 31 percent of the overall vote , timoshenko 's bloc 24 percent , and our ukraine would be third with 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were bad news for president viktor yushchenko the polls showed that two other parties were likely to get more than the 3 percent of the general vote required to get into parliament - the socialists with 5 percent and the communists with 3 percent . mandate for opponents " the results are the ukrainian population 's evaluation of ...
-lrb- yushchenko 's -rrb- first year in office .
they have given their mandate to his opponents , " said kost bondarenko , a political analyst in kiev . yushchenko was swept into power after the 2004 " orange revolution " street protests over a contested presidential ballot , amid which the nation 's supreme court threw out the results that initially handed victory to yanukovich .
the then-opposition leader easily won a rerun ballot but his popularity has plummeted as the economy slumped and the " orange " team splintered amid infighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko could become prime minister once more the president 's apparent poor showing in sunday 's poll will push him towards a coalition with tymoshenko , analysts agreed early monday , while officials from the two parties suggested an agreement could be signed later in the day . " the most probable coalition will be orange ... the region party 's victory is only a formal one , " said volodymyr fesenko , an independent analyst . " this is a blow for yushchenko , but not defeat , " said bondarenko . timoshenko or yanukovich as premier ?
tymoshenko , too , downplayed the regions victory , saying an " orange " coalition would relegate yanukovich 's party to an opposition role in the new parliament . " this is absolutely okay .
the country needs a strong opposition , " timoshenko said in early morning televised remarks .
tymoshenko looks set to regain the premiership in a coalition with our ukraine . " our ukraine has agreed on the position that the force that gets the most votes ... will propose its candidacy for the prime minister 's post , " said roman bezsmertnyi , campaign chief for our ukraine . when asked what would happen if yushchenko refused her candidacy for the premiership , tymoshenko said in televised comments : " he would have to agree to the premiership of -lrb- viktor -rrb- yanukovich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich appears to be on the way up again such a coalition would allow yushchenko to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward membership in the european union and the nato , analysts said . but an alliance between the president and his erstwhile " orange " partner is likely to be a tense one , as the ambitious tymoshenko and measured yushchenko are likely to spar on several issues , analysts say .
these include a recent gas deal with russia , which tymoshenko has demanded be scrapped ; reviewing questionable privatizations , which she has vowed to pursue despite investor unease ; and intervention in the economy , which free market-oriented yushchenko opposes . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw .

that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad .

the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .
" it 's good that we now have a movie like this , but it 's also good to have films that show the more positive side of life back then .

" i see the outcome as an affirmation of what the grand coalition has accomplished until now and encouragement for the steps ahead , " merkel told reporters at her party headquarters on monday .
" we will put issues on the agenda .
tough working weeks lie ahead of us . " observers from across the political spectrum said it was now time after the coalition 's extended political honeymoon for it to face up to daunting problems including the ailing health care system , the 12-percent jobless rate and the overhaul of the creaking federal system . " everybody feels like a winner , " political analyst peter lösche told rolling news channel n24 .
" now they can get on with the business of governing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt faces a tough time with her reforms merkel presented a long list of policy initiatives for the " second stage " of her term focusing on reform of the federal system , family policy , health care , government red tape , energy policy , the labor market and corporate taxes . the chancellor was due to meet health minister ulla schmidt later on monday to prepare cross-party talks scheduled for wednesday on health-care reform , according to government sources .
both coalition parties have pledged to narrow their differences on health care before parliament 's two-month summer recess , which begins on july 7 . press demand action , reserve judgement on merkel 's credentials commenting on merkel ’ s " phased " chancellorship ; the center-left berliner zeitung said the first stage had been dominated by confidence-building between the coalition parties but that the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition .
but also that they expect something of it .
the clear outcome of the poll is an order to begin in earnest with the work at hand , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and müntefering : " you hum it , i 'll play it " in germany ’ s neighbor , the vienna-based die presse said that merkel was facing her last chance to finally get to grips with urgently needed reforms .
so far the coalition 's performance , it says , has all the " soporific dynamism of a jazz bar session after midnight , with angela merkel softly stroking the drums with a little brush and -lrb- her spd deputy -rrb- franz müntefering plucking leisurely at the bass " . die presse added that the coalition parties , says the paper , will have to " step up their tempo considerably " as germany 's honeymoon with the new chancellor may only last a few more months .
" the credit she accumulated recently with her feel-good governing style and her faultless round of the world 's red carpets could be used up very quickly , " it warned . the frankfurter rundschau warned that now the state elections were over , the coalition has " lost its only remaining excuse " for not tackling controversial issues .
" it is no longer enough to make a good impression at home and abroad - action is needed now , " the paper insisted . the süddeutsche zeitung called merkel 's coalition a " complex mobile " which " starts to tremble with every draught , swings up and down if there is a wind and gets tangled up in a storm . "
while merkel has surprised people home and abroad with her unexpected popularity and respect " she has done so not through her actions , but through her failure to act ... she has only been a half chancellor , " it concluded . both sides of coalition relieved at election results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was pleased platzeck 's spd did n't cause any ructions however , despite the fact that the elections seemed to open possible floodgates of criticism , both governing parties in the coalition - traditional rivals - said the shared triumphs helped secure the balance of power in the " grand coalition " in berlin .
merkel had feared a debacle for the social democrats could destabilize the alliance . " i am pleased as the chairman of the german social democrats that i am able to welcome election victories in state polls , " matthias platzeck said .
he was referring to a string of state poll defeats for the social democrats which prompted merkel 's predecessor chancellor gerhard schröder to call for new elections which set the wheels in motion for his ouster . in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , the prosperous home of auto giants daimlerchrysler and porsche , the conservatives captured 44.2 percent of the vote , according to provisional official figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were favorable ; the turnout was n't the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats . voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party which won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21.4 percent . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . healthy results but poor voter turnout they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt and a pure social democrat government in rhineland-palatinate would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , meaning the free democrats have little power to block legislation . total electoral turnout in the three states , however , was only about 60 percent , a historic low . the leader of the opposition greens party claudia roth said the grand coalition was leading to " depoliticization " - turning voters off the political process . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state elections keep premiers in place conservatives and social democrats held on to power in three german state polls sunday , signaling good news for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed .

the sources said the plans are at an early stage . as well as the stake in sony bmg - the new york-based joint venture of bertelsmann and japan 's sony - the german group is considering selling its wholly-owned bmg music publishing business , the ft said . together , the music companies reported revenues of 2.1 billion euros last year , down 16.5 percent as cd sales fell , the report said . bertelsma n n ow n ers oppose public offeri n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen gunter thielen , bertelsmann 's chief executive , said last week the company would not decide about any moves until it knew more about the intentions of gbl , which has the right to place its stake in bertelsmann from may , potentially leading to an initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- .
but he did not rule out selling the music companies . bertelsmann , which owns european broadcaster rtl and book publisher random house among other businesses , is privately owned by the mohn family .
the family is reportedly opposed to taking the company to the stock market and is therefore looking for ways to buy back the gbl stake to prevent an ipo . sony has the right to take full control of the joint venture , which is second only to vivendi 's universal music , but is not expected to invest more in media while it is still fixing its electronics arm , the ft said . in tokyo , sony spokesman koji kurata declined to comment on the report , which he said was " based on speculation of a move by bertelsmann .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner . " the first two international conferences on early warning were held in germany in 1998 and 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner .

the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner .

the gbl stake is reportedly worth four to five million euros .

but he did not rule out selling the music companies . bertelsmann , which owns european broadcaster rtl and book publisher random house among other businesses , is privately owned by the mohn family .
the family is reportedly opposed to taking the company to the stock market and is therefore looking for ways to buy back the gbl stake to prevent an ipo . sony has the right to take full control of the joint venture , which is second only to vivendi 's universal music , but is not expected to invest more in media while it is still fixing its electronics arm , the ft said . in tokyo , sony spokesman koji kurata declined to comment on the report , which he said was " based on speculation of a move by bertelsmann .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner . " the first two international conferences on early warning were held in germany in 1998 and 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

" i see the outcome as an affirmation of what the grand coalition has accomplished until now and encouragement for the steps ahead , " merkel told reporters at her party headquarters on monday .
" we will put issues on the agenda .
tough working weeks lie ahead of us . " observers from across the political spectrum said it was now time after the coalition 's extended political honeymoon for it to face up to daunting problems including the ailing health care system , the 12-percent jobless rate and the overhaul of the creaking federal system . " everybody feels like a winner , " political analyst peter lösche told rolling news channel n24 .
" now they can get on with the business of governing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt faces a tough time with her reforms merkel presented a long list of policy initiatives for the " second stage " of her term focusing on reform of the federal system , family policy , health care , government red tape , energy policy , the labor market and corporate taxes . the chancellor was due to meet health minister ulla schmidt later on monday to prepare cross-party talks scheduled for wednesday on health-care reform , according to government sources .
both coalition parties have pledged to narrow their differences on health care before parliament 's two-month summer recess , which begins on july 7 . press demand action , reserve judgement on merkel 's credentials commenting on merkel ’ s " phased " chancellorship ; the center-left berliner zeitung said the first stage had been dominated by confidence-building between the coalition parties but that the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition .
but also that they expect something of it .
the clear outcome of the poll is an order to begin in earnest with the work at hand , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and müntefering : " you hum it , i 'll play it " in germany ’ s neighbor , the vienna-based die presse said that merkel was facing her last chance to finally get to grips with urgently needed reforms .
so far the coalition 's performance , it says , has all the " soporific dynamism of a jazz bar session after midnight , with angela merkel softly stroking the drums with a little brush and -lrb- her spd deputy -rrb- franz müntefering plucking leisurely at the bass " . die presse added that the coalition parties , says the paper , will have to " step up their tempo considerably " as germany 's honeymoon with the new chancellor may only last a few more months .
" the credit she accumulated recently with her feel-good governing style and her faultless round of the world 's red carpets could be used up very quickly , " it warned . the frankfurter rundschau warned that now the state elections were over , the coalition has " lost its only remaining excuse " for not tackling controversial issues .
" it is no longer enough to make a good impression at home and abroad - action is needed now , " the paper insisted . the süddeutsche zeitung called merkel 's coalition a " complex mobile " which " starts to tremble with every draught , swings up and down if there is a wind and gets tangled up in a storm . "
while merkel has surprised people home and abroad with her unexpected popularity and respect " she has done so not through her actions , but through her failure to act ... she has only been a half chancellor , " it concluded . both sides of coalition relieved at election results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was pleased platzeck 's spd did n't cause any ructions however , despite the fact that the elections seemed to open possible floodgates of criticism , both governing parties in the coalition - traditional rivals - said the shared triumphs helped secure the balance of power in the " grand coalition " in berlin .
merkel had feared a debacle for the social democrats could destabilize the alliance . " i am pleased as the chairman of the german social democrats that i am able to welcome election victories in state polls , " matthias platzeck said .
he was referring to a string of state poll defeats for the social democrats which prompted merkel 's predecessor chancellor gerhard schröder to call for new elections which set the wheels in motion for his ouster . in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , the prosperous home of auto giants daimlerchrysler and porsche , the conservatives captured 44.2 percent of the vote , according to provisional official figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were favorable ; the turnout was n't the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats . voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party which won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21.4 percent . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . healthy results but poor voter turnout they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt and a pure social democrat government in rhineland-palatinate would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , meaning the free democrats have little power to block legislation . total electoral turnout in the three states , however , was only about 60 percent , a historic low . the leader of the opposition greens party claudia roth said the grand coalition was leading to " depoliticization " - turning voters off the political process . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state elections keep premiers in place conservatives and social democrats held on to power in three german state polls sunday , signaling good news for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built .

" recovery is going to take years .
fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .
" there was no early warning system and now we are all living with the results , " clinton said .
asian warning system due in july the un 's top humanitarian official , jan egeland , said on monday in bonn that a tsunami warning system would be inaugurated in asia by july but admitted that many communities would still not be plugged into it .

" from july the scientific part of the project will be implemented .
we will have gauges throughout the indian ocean sending data out every 10 minutes , " she said . though this meant that the mainland of every country in the region would be warned of an impending tsunami , most nations that were struck in december 2004 have not put in place communication systems and evacuation paths to help people to safety when the next one strikes . " the rest of what is needed to get the information to the people is not in place .
president clinton 's real aim here is to tell them to get on with it , " the source , who asked not to be named , added .

we can not halt the forces of nature , " he said . instead the international community needed to reduce the vulnerability of people , especially the poor , to weather disasters , with a first step being to warn them to move to safe ground .
steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .
he said video footage shot during the tsunami showed a settlement leaving their homes and running for high ground , from where they saw their possessions being washing away by the tsunami .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner . " the first two international conferences on early warning were held in germany in 1998 and 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german tsunami early warning system takes shape almost 11 months after the devastating tsunami in south asia , a german-developed early warning system has gone into action , with the releasing of the first buoy off the coast of indonesia .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes . " these few seconds of warning can save lives and serve to implement emergency safety measures .
one can not prevent the disaster but one can mitigate the fallout , " he said , adding that earthquake alert systems remain very rare despite the relief they can bring . " we have knowledge that we need to put into practice . " risks of disaster increasing the chairwoman of the german committee for disaster reduction , irmgard schwaetzer , said the number of natural disasters was increasing along with the number of people at risk as cities become ever more populous . " we have to develop warning systems and preventative measures to deal with events which we have not contemplated before , " she said , adding that in the end it all comes down to communication and cooperation . " early warning can only work when the warnings reach the affected people , when they are well informed and react in the correct manner .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .
" it 's good that we now have a movie like this , but it 's also good to have films that show the more positive side of life back then .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .

we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

" i see the outcome as an affirmation of what the grand coalition has accomplished until now and encouragement for the steps ahead , " merkel told reporters at her party headquarters on monday .
" we will put issues on the agenda .
tough working weeks lie ahead of us . " observers from across the political spectrum said it was now time after the coalition 's extended political honeymoon for it to face up to daunting problems including the ailing health care system , the 12-percent jobless rate and the overhaul of the creaking federal system . " everybody feels like a winner , " political analyst peter lösche told rolling news channel n24 .
" now they can get on with the business of governing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt faces a tough time with her reforms merkel presented a long list of policy initiatives for the " second stage " of her term focusing on reform of the federal system , family policy , health care , government red tape , energy policy , the labor market and corporate taxes . the chancellor was due to meet health minister ulla schmidt later on monday to prepare cross-party talks scheduled for wednesday on health-care reform , according to government sources .
both coalition parties have pledged to narrow their differences on health care before parliament 's two-month summer recess , which begins on july 7 . press demand action , reserve judgement on merkel 's credentials commenting on merkel ’ s " phased " chancellorship ; the center-left berliner zeitung said the first stage had been dominated by confidence-building between the coalition parties but that the government could no longer drag its feet on the domestic agenda . " voters have shown that they are serious about the grand coalition .
but also that they expect something of it .
the clear outcome of the poll is an order to begin in earnest with the work at hand , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and müntefering : " you hum it , i 'll play it " in germany ’ s neighbor , the vienna-based die presse said that merkel was facing her last chance to finally get to grips with urgently needed reforms .
so far the coalition 's performance , it says , has all the " soporific dynamism of a jazz bar session after midnight , with angela merkel softly stroking the drums with a little brush and -lrb- her spd deputy -rrb- franz müntefering plucking leisurely at the bass " . die presse added that the coalition parties , says the paper , will have to " step up their tempo considerably " as germany 's honeymoon with the new chancellor may only last a few more months .
" the credit she accumulated recently with her feel-good governing style and her faultless round of the world 's red carpets could be used up very quickly , " it warned . the frankfurter rundschau warned that now the state elections were over , the coalition has " lost its only remaining excuse " for not tackling controversial issues .
" it is no longer enough to make a good impression at home and abroad - action is needed now , " the paper insisted . the süddeutsche zeitung called merkel 's coalition a " complex mobile " which " starts to tremble with every draught , swings up and down if there is a wind and gets tangled up in a storm . "
while merkel has surprised people home and abroad with her unexpected popularity and respect " she has done so not through her actions , but through her failure to act ... she has only been a half chancellor , " it concluded . both sides of coalition relieved at election results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was pleased platzeck 's spd did n't cause any ructions however , despite the fact that the elections seemed to open possible floodgates of criticism , both governing parties in the coalition - traditional rivals - said the shared triumphs helped secure the balance of power in the " grand coalition " in berlin .
merkel had feared a debacle for the social democrats could destabilize the alliance . " i am pleased as the chairman of the german social democrats that i am able to welcome election victories in state polls , " matthias platzeck said .
he was referring to a string of state poll defeats for the social democrats which prompted merkel 's predecessor chancellor gerhard schröder to call for new elections which set the wheels in motion for his ouster . in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , the prosperous home of auto giants daimlerchrysler and porsche , the conservatives captured 44.2 percent of the vote , according to provisional official figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were favorable ; the turnout was n't the christian democrats have ruled the state for half a century and will probably continue their coalition with the liberal free democrats . voters in the depressed eastern state of saxony-anhalt gave the christian democrats 36.2 percent of the vote , according to official figures , and put the social democrats in third place behind the left party which won 24.1 percent . the conservatives ' partners in the state , the free democrats , failed to muster a score that would allow them to continue the alliance , increasing the likelihood of a link-up with the social democrats , who garnered about 21.4 percent . meanwhile the social democrats scored a historic victory in wine-producing rhineland-palatinate thanks to the popularity of premier kurt beck , one of their leading figures at the national level . healthy results but poor voter turnout they drew 45.6 percent of the vote , enough for an absolute majority and far ahead of the christian democrats , who suffered a crushing defeat with under 33 percent of the vote . a " grand coalition " in saxony-anhalt and a pure social democrat government in rhineland-palatinate would broaden the merkel coalition 's majority in the bundesrat upper house , meaning the free democrats have little power to block legislation . total electoral turnout in the three states , however , was only about 60 percent , a historic low . the leader of the opposition greens party claudia roth said the grand coalition was leading to " depoliticization " - turning voters off the political process . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state elections keep premiers in place conservatives and social democrats held on to power in three german state polls sunday , signaling good news for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

the world soccer body has set up a company whose sole purpose is to watch for suspect betting patterns . fifa early warning system gmbh might more resemble the name of an anti-terror company .
the matter of possible terrorist attacks is not being neglected by anyone involved with the world cup , but early warning system gmbh has another mission - the prevention of illegal betting operations . speaking to reporters on friday at the conclusion of a four-day workshop for world cup referee candidates , fifa 's general secretary urs linsi said the company was created back in january 2006 as a response to the robert hoyzer betting scandal that broke in germany last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen -lrb- red -rrb- was possibly at center of manipulation in 2002-03 that is not the only scandal that has come to the surface in germany .
state prosecutors are looking into possible manipulations in second and third-division matches .
one munich newspaper published a story it then later retracted that implied international midfielder bastian schweinsteiger had been interrogated by the munich police over possible bets . first-division side bayer leverkusen is also at the center of an investigation of possible betting improprieties by prosecutors in cologne during that club 's fight to avoid relegation in the 2002-03 season . world-wide effort necessary fifa is not leaving anything to chance when it comes to gambling and will be keeping a close eye on all betting .
early warning system will be cooperating with companies that specialize in spotting what could be potential attempts at manipulating games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer 's involvement in match-fixing started an avalanche in german soccer " i think we 've taken the necessary steps to prevent match-fixing .
and this is not just for the world cup , " linsi said . the hoyzer scandal was a huge embarrassment to germany in the long run-up to the world cup that the country is hosting from june 9 to july 9 .
late last year the former referee was found guilty of fixing matches in a betting fraud worth two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.39 bill . -rrb- . hoyzer was sentenced last november to two years and five months for his role in the affair . linsi said that he believed that the hoyzer scandal in germany was an exception .
match-fixing reaches far beyond germany 's borders .
to fight this , fifa 's executive committee recently approved a task force report to investigate better preventative measures .
one method would be improved cooperation between fifa confederations and the national associations . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer chiefs deny schweinsteiger allegations german soccer chiefs on thursday issued a vehement denial of a newspaper claim that bayern munich star bastian schweinsteiger was the international footballer involved in a betting scandal .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .

there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .

that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .

sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .

" spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .

" tens of thousands of people need not have died if the indian ocean had had an early warning system , " german foreign ministry official hans-joachim daerr told a press briefing ahead of the three-day meeting in bonn , in western germany . projects to improve alert systems some 1,300 delegates attending the conference are also due to discuss 100 project proposals for alert systems on anything from floods in romania , sand and dust storms in asia and droughts and locust plagues in africa . the aim is to cover areas that are not yet on the warning map and to improve existing systems to help people reach safe ground when natural disasters strike , said brigitte leoni , a spokeswoman for the un 's international strategy for disaster reduction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake in pakistan last october killed some 73,000 people the projects will serve to illustrate gaps in the international early warning program -lrb- iewp -rrb- that was adopted in japan in january 2005 against the backdrop of the asian tsunami .
the meeting will also focus on the particular problems in trying to create warning systems to limit loss of lives and destruction from earthquakes like the one that devastated pakistan last october , killing 73,000 people . a german geographic researcher who will attend the conference , jochen zschau , said a warning system can give people only a few seconds or at most a minute to react before the first weak tremors are followed by the full shock of an earthquake . but in this time authorities could bring public transport systems to a halt and lower the pressure in gas pipes to prevent the explosions and fires that often follow earthquakes .

" we will work all day monday and maybe even a bit on tuesday , " yaroslav davydovych , the head of ukraine 's central election commission , told reporters . the regions party , headed by russia-friendly ex-premier viktor yanukovich , led with 24.58 percent , " orange revolution " heroine yulia tymoshenko 's bloc had 24.08 percent , and president viktor yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc was in third with 17.01 percent , the preliminary results showed .
exit polls released after the close of voting sunday suggested regions would get 31 percent of the overall vote , timoshenko 's bloc 24 percent , and our ukraine would be third with 16 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were bad news for president viktor yushchenko the polls showed that two other parties were likely to get more than the 3 percent of the general vote required to get into parliament - the socialists with 5 percent and the communists with 3 percent . mandate for opponents " the results are the ukrainian population 's evaluation of ...
-lrb- yushchenko 's -rrb- first year in office .
they have given their mandate to his opponents , " said kost bondarenko , a political analyst in kiev . yushchenko was swept into power after the 2004 " orange revolution " street protests over a contested presidential ballot , amid which the nation 's supreme court threw out the results that initially handed victory to yanukovich .
the then-opposition leader easily won a rerun ballot but his popularity has plummeted as the economy slumped and the " orange " team splintered amid infighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko could become prime minister once more the president 's apparent poor showing in sunday 's poll will push him towards a coalition with tymoshenko , analysts agreed early monday , while officials from the two parties suggested an agreement could be signed later in the day . " the most probable coalition will be orange ... the region party 's victory is only a formal one , " said volodymyr fesenko , an independent analyst . " this is a blow for yushchenko , but not defeat , " said bondarenko . timoshenko or yanukovich as premier ?
tymoshenko , too , downplayed the regions victory , saying an " orange " coalition would relegate yanukovich 's party to an opposition role in the new parliament . " this is absolutely okay .
the country needs a strong opposition , " timoshenko said in early morning televised remarks .
tymoshenko looks set to regain the premiership in a coalition with our ukraine . " our ukraine has agreed on the position that the force that gets the most votes ... will propose its candidacy for the prime minister 's post , " said roman bezsmertnyi , campaign chief for our ukraine . when asked what would happen if yushchenko refused her candidacy for the premiership , tymoshenko said in televised comments : " he would have to agree to the premiership of -lrb- viktor -rrb- yanukovich . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich appears to be on the way up again such a coalition would allow yushchenko to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward membership in the european union and the nato , analysts said . but an alliance between the president and his erstwhile " orange " partner is likely to be a tense one , as the ambitious tymoshenko and measured yushchenko are likely to spar on several issues , analysts say .
these include a recent gas deal with russia , which tymoshenko has demanded be scrapped ; reviewing questionable privatizations , which she has vowed to pursue despite investor unease ; and intervention in the economy , which free market-oriented yushchenko opposes . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

tymoshenko looks set to regain the premiership in a coalition with our ukraine .

" recovery is going to take years .
fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .
" there was no early warning system and now we are all living with the results , " clinton said .
asian warning system due in july the un 's top humanitarian official , jan egeland , said on monday in bonn that a tsunami warning system would be inaugurated in asia by july but admitted that many communities would still not be plugged into it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said rich countries would pay sooner or later a un source said clinton and egeland were meeting behind closed doors at the conference with representatives of the 28 countries in the indian ocean to push them to take steps that would ensure the warnings reach their people . " from july the scientific part of the project will be implemented .
we will have gauges throughout the indian ocean sending data out every 10 minutes , " she said . though this meant that the mainland of every country in the region would be warned of an impending tsunami , most nations that were struck in december 2004 have not put in place communication systems and evacuation paths to help people to safety when the next one strikes . " the rest of what is needed to get the information to the people is not in place .
president clinton 's real aim here is to tell them to get on with it , " the source , who asked not to be named , added .
just a matter of time in an opening address to the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the question was not whether such an event would shake the world again , but when .

hurricane katrina , then the kashmir earthquake that buried 16,000 people in their homes .
we can not halt the forces of nature , " he said . instead the international community needed to reduce the vulnerability of people , especially the poor , to weather disasters , with a first step being to warn them to move to safe ground .
steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .
he said video footage shot during the tsunami showed a settlement leaving their homes and running for high ground , from where they saw their possessions being washing away by the tsunami . " afterwards the children told reporters that they had been taught by their grandparents to read the signs of a sea surge .
it shows that warning systems can function without technology and great financial input , " he said . the conference runs until wednesday and will see delegates vet more than 100 project proposals for warning systems around the world . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talks aim to improve world 's disaster-readiness experts from 140 nations meet in germany from monday to see how far the world has come with early warning systems in the 15 months since the devastating asian tsunami .

" recovery is going to take years .
fifty thousand people are still living in tents .
i hope you will think of them , " clinton told delegates on the opening day of the un 's third conference on early warning . clinton , the un special envoy for tsunami relief , warned wealthy nations that unless they helped to rebuild poor communities such as on the indonesian island of sumatra and on the maldives in such a way that they are protected from future disasters , they would one day again have to pay for emergency relief . " rich countries will pay sooner or later .
but we have the habit of ignoring the problems of our brothers and sisters until they are too great and painful to ignore . " clinton said in the 15 months since killer waves struck the coastlines of 11 nations in the indian ocean , killing 217,000 people , some 100,000 homes and 400 schools had been built . " but so much more needs to be done , " he added , saying that the biggest challenge was to implement a tsunami warning system that will reach the communities at risk of being engulfed by waves .
" there was no early warning system and now we are all living with the results , " clinton said .
asian warning system due in july the un 's top humanitarian official , jan egeland , said on monday in bonn that a tsunami warning system would be inaugurated in asia by july but admitted that many communities would still not be plugged into it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton said rich countries would pay sooner or later a un source said clinton and egeland were meeting behind closed doors at the conference with representatives of the 28 countries in the indian ocean to push them to take steps that would ensure the warnings reach their people . " from july the scientific part of the project will be implemented .
we will have gauges throughout the indian ocean sending data out every 10 minutes , " she said . though this meant that the mainland of every country in the region would be warned of an impending tsunami , most nations that were struck in december 2004 have not put in place communication systems and evacuation paths to help people to safety when the next one strikes . " the rest of what is needed to get the information to the people is not in place .
president clinton 's real aim here is to tell them to get on with it , " the source , who asked not to be named , added .
just a matter of time in an opening address to the meeting , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the question was not whether such an event would shake the world again , but when .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said it 's merely a matter of time before another such disaster strikes " the chain of natural disasters has hardly been interrupted since the asian tsunami ...
hurricane katrina , then the kashmir earthquake that buried 16,000 people in their homes .
we can not halt the forces of nature , " he said . instead the international community needed to reduce the vulnerability of people , especially the poor , to weather disasters , with a first step being to warn them to move to safe ground .
steinmeier said the most important thing was not sophisticated technology or money , but finding simple ways of informing people and ensuring they heed the warnings that will save their lives .

it referred the case back to the attorney general who , pending the results of the tests , can return the case to court or dismiss it . " in our law it is clear - if one is not mentally healthy , he or she can not be tried , he can be freed , " wasay said . supreme court spokesman wakil omari said on sunday that rahman 's relatives had said the convert was " not mentally fit . " he himself has said that he hears strange voices in his head , " he said . the case has stirred a storm of protest in germany , the us and other nations on which war-shattered afghanistan relies to rebuild and stem a deadly taliban insurgency .
these nations have demanded afghanistan respect international laws on freedom of religion . afgha n protests agai n st droppi n g case but the government , which does not want to alienate its allies , is also under pressure from religious circles to respect islamic sharia law on which the constitution is partly based . around 200 men demonstrated in the northern city of mazar-i-sharif monday against the court decision not to proceed with the trial . the men , mostly students and mullahs from a local islamic school , condemned western " interference " and chanted " death to america " and " death to bush .

the film marks a sharp departure from previous , often sentimentalized films about the era . up to now , successful movies about east germany generally treated their subject with rose-tinted glasses firmly in place over the camera lens . " sonnenallee , " a coming-of-age story released in 1999 , was a comedy that focused on the absurdity of daily life in the german democratic republic .
while it showed the pervasive presence of the police state , the functionaries and police were generally doltish buffoons , more annoying than anything else . the 2003 international hit " goodbye , lenin ! " took a somewhat warm-and-fuzzy look back at the time just before and after the fall of the berlin wall .
while not praising the gdr system , the film did take a swipe or two at the cold wind of burger king capitalism that suddenly blew through the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster for " the lives of others " " das leben der anderen " -lrb- " the lives of others " -rrb- , the first feature film by 32-year-old florian henckel von donnersmarck , dispenses with these nostalgic treatments , instead choosing to explore how east germany 's paranoid secret police service , the stasi , invaded the lives of so many of its own citizens , destroying many along the way . " this film is a more serious consideration of the era than ones that proceeded it , " said mike swain , head of the german online movie site kino.de.
" it has a very precise analysis of a police state .
on another level , it asks if it 's possible to maintain one 's humanity in a totalitarian system . " spies in the attic the story revolves around stasi officer gerd wiesler -lrb- ulrich mühe -rrb- , who is given the task of spying on a successful east german playwright named georg dreyman -lrb- sebastian koch -rrb- .
the dramatist has done nothing to offend the regime , but an east german minister has taken a liking to dreyman 's girlfriend , actress christa-maria sieland -lrb- martina gedeck -rrb- , and wants to discredit the toast of the theater scene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playwright georg dreyman unwraps a birthday gift with girlfriend christa-maria sieland wiesler and stasi employees bug every room in dryman 's apartment - including the bathroom - and then set up a listening post in the attic .
there , wiesler and another man work in shifts , following every conversation or intimate moment and typing out detailed records of what they hear , no matter how banal . while wiesler begins the film as a committed stasi man , even conducting classes for new secret police recruits about interrogation methods , cracks begin to form in his worldview as he immerses himself in the lives of the artists he is spying on .
the sterility of his own overly fastidious life is highlighted as he discovers the richness in the world of the urbane playwright and his talented girlfriend . in one scene , while dreyman plays a sonata on the piano after a writer friend whose works have been banned by the regime kills himself , a tear rolls down wiesler 's face as he begins to realize how cruel and bankrupt the system he is supporting actually is . bildunterschrift : in the end , wiesler becomes dreyman 's guardian angel , protecting the playwright from the stasi discovering he has written an article critical of the regime for the west german press .
wiesler pays a high professional price for his actions while dreyman 's personal life is shattered by the state . extensive research director henckel von donnersmarck , who was born in cologne and grew up in new york and west berlin and attended oxford and the prestigious hff film school in munich , spent a year researching the topic .
he spent time at the locations in the film , including the stasi prison at hohenschönhausen and the organization 's headquarters - both now museums . " locations are able to store up emotions , " he said in an interview .
" these visits often told me more as the many books i pored over through the years or the documentaries i saw . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- right -rrb- on the set with actor ulrich mühe he also conducted interviews with many contemporary witnesses , including prostitutes who worked for the secret police , former prisoners , artists active in the gdr and even a former stasi officer who headed one of the domestic spying divisions . finding locations was an important and difficult process , since the director had a very exact idea of the picture of the country he wanted to convey .
that extended to the film 's reductive color palette , which the director used to convey an authentic picture of the country in the 1980s .
eliminating blues and reds and using an abundance of browns , beiges , greens and grays paints a monotone picture of a country drained of vitality and tinged with underlying fear . critical praise the film has been almost unanimously praised by critics and has already won four bavarian film prizes .
last week , it was announced that the film had been nominated in 11 categories of the german film awards , including best picture . while some who had personal experience with the stasi have argued that the film 's portrayal of the officer 's transformation stretches credibility , most opinions have been positive . " for me , this film marks the real beginning of a critical analysis of germany 's second dictatorship , " wolf biermann , a songwriter and former dissident who was thrown out of the gdr in 1976 , told daily die welt .
" it 's as if it had been taken from my own life . " bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , former head of the commission in charge of investigating the miles of stasi files left after the fall of the berlin wall , described the film as a " journey into a lost world " that leaves any nostalgia behind . " it 's an important contribution to our dealing appropriately with the era , " he said . too close for comfort ? for some , however , the film might be a too accurate look back at aspects of an era that they would prefer to forget .
sources at the film 's american distribution company buena vista told kino.de 's mike swain that the film is not doing as well in the eastern part of germany as had been expected . " there is still a cleft in the country , " he said .
" buena vista wanted the film running in as many places as possible all over germany , but that 's not happening in the east .
maybe it 's still too early for some people there . " jens planner-friedrich , who works at bürgerbüro e.v. , a group which helps those formerly prosecuted by the east german regime , said he is not surprised that this unvarnished look at the " real-existing socialism " of the time does not sit well with some . " there are still a lot of people who do n't want to be confronted with this part of the past , " he said .
" many would prefer to just remember the nice aspects of life then .
it 's simply human . " for one member of the cinema audience at a recent screening of the film in an eastern neighborhood of berlin , it was important to see both the good and the bad . " although i personally did n't have that kind of experience with the stasi , i think the film showed it how it was , " said the woman , who did n't want to give her name .
" it 's good that we now have a movie like this , but it 's also good to have films that show the more positive side of life back then .

still , vintners worry about what the future may bring . it 's a good time for german wine .
exports increased last year to 475 million euros -lrb- $ 569 million -rrb- , 10 percent more than the previous year and the highest level they 've been at since 1985 when an austrian wine scandal had a devastating knock-on effect in germany .
britain remains german wine 's biggest importer followed by the us and the netherlands .
and consumers have been devoting more attention to germany 's top wines , riesling above all . " the aficionados are in america first and foremost , " said prince michael zu salm-salm , head of germany 's fine wine association vdp .
" a riesling boom is underway in the united states , a real renaissance .
but the aficionados are also in southern europe .
in italy , in spain we 're gaining momentum dramatically .
and we can truly say that it 's a development that 's beginning to have a worldwide effect . " the success of riesling does n't merely have to do with the grape 's flavor , but also with the increasing number of foreign journalists who give german wine good marks , particularly wine guru robert parker . trouble brewing ? despite the boom in exports , german vintners are troubled by a recent addition to a winemaking agreement between the european union and the united states .
a coda to the accord , added in march , allows the americans to export wines to europe that have been chemically and physically treated using controversial techniques that are largely prohibited in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince zu salm-salm speaks for germany 's quality wine producers " there are two critical points to the agreement , " said monika christmann , an expert on cellar techniques at geisenheim technical college .
" for one , that all future techniques , that do n't yet even exist , have been approved .
that means that we must accept everything that comes from america in the future , and with that , the americans practically set the standard worldwide .
the second critical point is that an integral part of the agreement is that all these techniques can be employed without declaring it on the label . " thus , consumers wo n't be able to tell how a wine was treated and whether a wine labelled as having been produced " according to the manner of a johannisberg riesling " is indeed a johannisberg riesling . power of the purse two figures are crucial in order to understand why the eu agriculture ministers agreed to the deal : us wine exports to the eu were worth $ 325 million in 2005 , while eu exports to the us were valued at $ 2.6 billion . but the agreement has caused quite a bit of hysteria in europe , with a plethora of newspaper articles upbraiding so-called artificial or plastic wines from the us , and largely demonstrating ignorance of the facts .
politicians from the german neo-nazi npd party also took advantage of the controversy to promote anti-american sentiments with their slogan " german wine instead of american rotgut . "
german vintners ended up feeling like they had to defend the us at the same time as criticizing it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in cellar techniques have some vintners worried " the fact is , all over the world there are vintners who are craftsmen like us , said zu salm-salm .
" and in europe , too , there are companies that are more used to working industrially . " " in america , it 's basically accepted - not in california , but in other parts of america - to add water to wine or to separate it with spinning doctor machines and then reconstruct it .
naturally , that goes entirely against our understanding of wine . ...
we 're opposed to the wine trade agreement and demand that improvements are made to it , " he said . the deadline for changes to the deal ends in three months .
by then it will be clear whether german vintners can save their designations of origin and whether it will become obligatory to declare particular cellar techniques .

public prosecutors in cologne have begun questioning reiner calmund , the former manager of bayer leverkusen , in connection with allegations of match-fixing in german professional soccer . prosecutors are trying to find out whether calmund paid a six-figure sum to ensure that his team wasn ’ t relegated to the second division at the end of the 2002-2003 season . the allegations surrounding the former bundesliga club manager are just the latest to shake professional soccer in germany , as the country prepares to host the sport 's premier event , the world cup , in june . until he left bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2004 , reiner calmund was a favorite among both the fans and german soccer reporters . this is in part because he was always good for much more than a sound byte .
one question from a reporter was enough to launch calmund into a minutes-long monologue touching on a variety of issues that the reporter hadn ’ t yet been able to bring up , all delivered in calmund 's colorful rhineland vernacular . but his response to reporters seeking answers about his role in an alleged match-fixing scandal was uncharacteristically short and to the point : " i 'm completely clean . " he was responding to media reports that cologne prosecutors were investigating whether payments were made to fix three bundesliga matches in the 2002-2003 season to help leverkusen avoid relegation to the second division . günther feld , a cologne state prosecutor , told german public television at the weekend that his office had obtained written evidence that at least one bundesliga match involving bayer leverkusen in 2003 may have been fixed . " at first it was just rumors , and then things became more substantive .
our assessment is that there is more to this than just talk or rumors .
we believe we have ample reason to investigate , " feld said . over half a million euros in unexplained payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did calmund -lrb- here with rudi völler -rrb- look the other way ?
the 57-year-old calmund is being asked to explain a 580,000 euro -lrb- $ 697,421 -rrb- payment to agent and former player volker graul .
graul is also being investigated by prosecutors . calmund made out three checks of 50,000 , 150,000 and 380,000 euros for graul 's services but leverkusen claim the reason for the transactions has not been established . calmund , who was removed from his post in 2004 due to the unexplained irregularities , said the money was commission for the transfer of two players graul worked on .
however prosecutors are seeking to establish whether graul used the cash to bribe several players and ensure leverkusen were not relegated from the german top-flight . from champions league final to relegation fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer 's fortune faded after defeat to real madrid in 2003 in the 2002/03 season leverkusen , who had reached the champions league final the season before , were in the relegation zone with three games left , but won all of them to stay in the bundesliga . the three final games against arminia bielefeld , who graul used to play for , 1860 munich and fc nuremberg are all set to be investigated for player manipulation . the penultimate game of that season against 1860 munich has come under real scrutiny with allegations that graul gave 500,000 euros to three munich players to throw the game and kept 80,000 euros for himself . leverkusen won the match 3-0 scoring all the goals in the first 48 minutes .
1860 munich sporting director detlef romeiko denied the club 's players had been involved in throwing the match .
" we are sure our players have not been manipulated and did not receive any money , " romeiko told this week 's spiegel magazine . lawyers say cash was used on options for future players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calmund could face investigators if the case continues calmund 's lawyer , stefan seitz has also denied any wrong-doing on his client 's behalf , saying the funds did not go to fix matches .
" of course the prosecutors have to investigate any tips that they receive , no matter how absurd it is .
the question is : what was paid for with the 580,000 euros ?
it was for an option for player purchases , and we plan to prove this to the prosecutors . " german soccer has been dogged by scandal as it gears up to host this summer 's world cup .
earlier this month , four people were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged match-rigging in the second and third divisions . and last november , referee robert hoyzer was handed a jail sentence after he admitted conspiring to fix several games in the second and third division as well as the german cup , in return for payments from a croatian betting ring . if the leverkusen allegations explode into another full-blown scandal , the implications could be immense .

in the first of a series about motherhood and the role of the state in encouraging couples to have more children , the bbc news website 's clare murphy asks why governments are so concerned about the size of their populations .
william the conqueror was counting people nearly 1,000 years ago , and his european descendants are still at it .
small , today 's politicians contend , is n't beautiful .
europe 's working-age population is shrinking as fertility rates decline .
in a fit of gloom , one german minister recently warned of the country " turning the light out " if its birth rate did not pick up .
efforts to encourage couples to breed have a chequered history and , for many , recall fascist pasts .
mussolini heavily taxed single men in his battle for births , hitler awarded medals to women with large families in his quest for a superior german race .
no-one is yet berating bachelors or mooting medallions for multiple births .
but europe 's many governments are scrambling to find a solution .
who cares ?
demographic decline causes anxiety because it is thought to go hand-in-hand with economic decline .
with fewer , younger workers to pay the health and pension bills of an elderly population , states face an unprecedented fiscal burden .
the dependency ratio of those aged 65 and over to those of working age looks set to double from one-to-four to one-to-two in 2050 .
fertility rate in europe 2.1 children per woman is considered to be the population replacement level .
these are national averages ireland : 1.99 france : 1.90 norway : 1.81 sweden 1.75 uk : 1.74 netherlands : 1.73 germany : 1.37 italy : 1.33 spain : 1.32 greece : 1.29 source : eurostat - 2004 figures at-a-glance : national policies how can europe , which increasingly sees itself as a counterweight to us hegemony , claim equal status when it is being outpaced by american population growth ?
if current forecasts prove correct , then the us - which currently has 160m fewer people than the eu - will have equalled it by 2050 .
increasing immigration is , in theory , one option for europe , but most agree it is politically unfeasible in the current climate .

swedish and french birth rates may be higher than in much of europe , but despite their respective systems , both countries still lag behind the holy grail of 2.1 children per woman needed to keep a population stable .
europe is still feeling its way in this area , and may , some say , have to come to terms with the fact that there are women remaining childless or having small families by choice .
recent evidence from germany suggests that women may actually want fewer children than the two so often seen as the desirable norm - indeed some are happy with none at all .

other countries have also started toying with the idea of straight payments .
poland , where the population has fallen by half a million in the last six years , has recently passed legislation that will see women paid for each child they bear .
in italy , where the population could shrink by as much as one third by 2050 , one town has started offering couples 10,000 euros for each newborn baby .
how successful cash is as an incentive is still unclear .
one study suggests that , even when cash allowances are boosted by 25 % , the fertility rate climbs just marginally - perhaps by as little as 0.6 % .
and the impact of generous maternity leave schemes and state-subsidised child care has also yet to be fully established .
swedish and french birth rates may be higher than in much of europe , but despite their respective systems , both countries still lag behind the holy grail of 2.1 children per woman needed to keep a population stable .
europe is still feeling its way in this area , and may , some say , have to come to terms with the fact that there are women remaining childless or having small families by choice .
recent evidence from germany suggests that women may actually want fewer children than the two so often seen as the desirable norm - indeed some are happy with none at all .

salah aboulgasem , cub leader of the 1st cathays al huda group in cardiff , said he wanted to help young muslims become leaders in their community and society .
mr aboulgasem said scouting - one of the longest-running youth organisation in the world - was the best way to achieve this .
the scout movement will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2007 .
the different sections of the group will meet four times a week at roath park community centre in cardiff .
mr aboulgasem , whose brother yusuf is one of the cubs , said the first welsh muslim group would also be open to non-muslims .
but he told bbc radio wales that having a muslim scout group was important to muslim parents .
" if -lsb- the parents -rsb- know they are with other muslims who can understand them and treat them better - and suit their needs - then they will be more than happy to bring them along , " he said .
we 're trying to bring up and develop individuals so not only can they lead their local communities , but lead society cub leader salah aboulgasem activities at the scout group include educational , spiritual , and creative programmes .
camping , outdoor activities and alternative leisure activities which are often not accessible to muslim youths will also be available , the group said .
mr aboulgasem said there were problems with young muslims under-achieving in education .
" there 's a lack of integration with muslims in wider society and scouting is the most successful , longest-running youth organisation in the world , " he said .
" we try to promote and teach them individually and collectively to be active within their own communities and also within wider society .
" scouting is an excellent opportunity for that because you have a district system ...
we meet with other groups from across the city and across the district and we get to know each other and combine activities together .
" we 're trying to bring up and develop individuals so not only can they lead their local communities , but lead society .
" there 's definitely a need for something and scouting is the best form of that . "

teams from across the globe took part in the event , inspired by a.a. milne 's tale about winnie the pooh , which raises funds for charity .
the race involves dropping a stick into the river and seeing how long it takes to get to the finish line .
a team from milton keynes took the championship title off japan at days lock , little wittenham , oxfordshire .
eight-year-old harry norton shaw , from near abingdon , won the individual competition .
the event has been held in oxfordshire ever since a local lock-keeper noticed people were picking sticks off a hedge and playing the traditional game .
he began charging them in order to raise money for the royal national lifeboat institute -lrb- rnli -rrb- .
funds raised are now split between the rnli and the rotary club of sinodun 's charitable projects .
the original pooh-sticks bridge where winnie the pooh and christopher robin played in the books is believed to be based on a bridge in ashdown forest , a mile from hartfield in east sussex .

indonesia recalled its ambassador to canberra last week due to the decision .
australian foreign minister alexander downer tried to defuse the situation on monday , saying australia recognised indonesia 's sovereignty over papua .
papua was integrated into indonesia in 1969 , but a small separatist group has battled for independence ever since .
indonesian authorities are frequently accused of human rights abuses in the province .
temporary permits the row began after canberra granted temporary visas to 42 papuans - some of whom are reported to be leading pro-independence activists .
the papuans arrived in australia by boat in january , saying they were fleeing abuses by indonesia 's military .
they have been granted temporary protection visas - three-year renewable permits which allow immigrants to work .
the news has angered indonesians who see the decision as australian interference in indonesian national affairs .
about 200 people held banners and chanted slogans outside the australian embassy in central jakarta on monday .
" papua is part of indonesia , " rally organiser tri yulianto told the associated press .
" by giving visas to these papuans , it means australia supports the separatists , " he said .
but mr downer told parliament that the decision to grant the visas was made in accordance with international and australian law .
he added that the government valued the co-operation it had with indonesia .
" we will do what we can to ensure that that close friendship continues , " he said .

the plans for clifton include a new social and leisure centre with provision for a village hall , computer centre , fitness suite and spa .
the scheme has been developed by nottingham city council and the extracare charitable trust .
if granted planning permission , the construction would be completed by 2008 , according to extracare .
the plans would see 14 acres between barton lane and clifton lane developed into 250 flats and 70 bungalows .
they would provide accommodation for more than 400 people from the clifton estate and the wider nottingham area .
the project was put on hold in 2001 due to a lack of funding , but a grant of £ 3m from the department of health in 2005 has enabled it to continue .

the joint report by three public sector watchdogs said the nhs and care services treated older people with a lack of dignity and respect .
the audit commission , healthcare commission and commission for social care inspection said it was being made worse by a lack of consultation .
campaigners said elderly people had become second-class citizens .
the report , which assesses the government 's progress half-way through its 10-year plan to improve services for the over 50s , found while some services had improved , progress had been patchy and slow in other areas . "
sadly , too many older people in need of public services are currently treated as second-class citizens " gordon lishman , of age concern england ' my mother got worse in hospital ' tony robinson : my tragedy david behan , chief inspector of the commission for social care inspection , said : " the evidence from this study is that older people are not involved in the design of services and , consequently , services are not tailored to their needs and aspirations .
" it is vital to understand and respond to the specific needs of older people . "
and anna walker , chief executive of the healthcare commission , said : " older people are the biggest users of healthcare , occupying almost two thirds of our hospital beds , yet they continue to be a low priority in both the planning and development of our health service . "
have your say " the elder generation deserve all the dignity and respect that is rightfully due to them . "
tom mclaughlan , western isles send us your comments none of the 10 communities across england , whose public services were scrutinised , had reached all the government-set milestones to enable them to meet the standards in the national service framework .
two areas of concern were the planning of public transport and the low priority given to foot care services .
age discrimination one of the worst areas , the report found , was mental health care , where older people found services deteriorating as they passed the age of 65 .
the vast majority of older people surveyed said they had not been asked their views on the nhs or council services in the last year , and 80 % did not think they had influenced the planning of services .
the report did find that steps had been taken to address age discrimination in public services and more people were being supported to allow them to live at home .
gordon lishman , director-general of age concern england , said it was " shocking " that so many social services departments were still failing to meet the needs of older people - the main users of these services .
he said : " sadly , too many older people in need of public services are currently treated as second-class citizens . "
liberal democrat health spokesman steve webb said : " the needs of older people are not a priority for this government . "
andrew lansley , the shadow health secretary , said the report highlighted the possibility that government targets for assessing patients in accident and emergency departments had led to the rushed discharge of older people .
he also highlighted concerns about inconsistencies in community rehabilitation of stroke patients .
but care services minister liam byrne insisted that older people 's access to care had been " completely transformed " although neglect was still " too big a part of the story " .
he said plans would be unveiled next month to improve the situation .
and professor ian philp , national director for older people 's health , added measures had also been taken to tackle discrimination , but there was more work to do to reverse the lack of respect shown to the elderly .
