program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 04.06.2006 german fraternities fight right-wing image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protocol and ceremony still attract some german students to join fraternities student fraternities may offer " an escape from the anonymity of university life " , but can they shed their burdensome reputation of being too nationalistic ?
the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .
but in reality , most do turn it down because the price tag on these luxurious living quarters also includes membership in a fraternity , or " studentenverbindung . " " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .
fifty years ago , some 30 percent of all german students belonged to such organizations ; today fraternity members represent between 2 and 3 percent of the total student population .
the traditional practice of intentionally wounding each other in the face with swords while fencing may also have contributed to students ' loss of interest . yet those who do join are not all right-wing extremists , as the stereotype may suggest .
rudi , a 22-year-old student of english and sports , admitted that he had simply " landed in the fraternity by accident " after finding a room there on the internet . cosmopolita n i n n ature ? bernd , another nibelungen resident , painted a rather cosmopolitan picture of the organization -lrb- cocktails aside -rrb- . " just because we 're in a fraternity does n't mean we 're different from everybody else , " he said .
" we have parties here like everyone else too .
and they 're really fun because lots of people come together , different nationalities are there , which makes for a good international mix and that can only mean fun . " the nibelugen house , located near the university in cologne , is international indeed : only two of its six residents are german . vladimir müller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

" ayatollah ali khamenei also gave the united states a staunch warning that any " mistake " in its dealings with oil-rich iran would lead to consequences for global energy supplies . " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes . " the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany are poised to present iran with an offer of incentives and the prospect of fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspends uranium enrichment . that activity is at the center of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make reactor fuel - and not bombs - and that enrichment is a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . sola n a to travel to tehra n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani during a march meeting in the german embassy in vienna eu foreign policy chief javier solana is expected in tehran in the coming days to present the proposals .
iran has been given just weeks to make up its mind - or else face security council action including possible sanctions . but khamenei added to indications that the offer could end up being dead on arrival by shrugging off any fear of the consequences . " there is no consensus against iran , " he said .
" it is only the americans and some of their allies .
this is all about a political monopoly of energy .
they want others to beg for energy . " speaking at khomeini 's mausoleum on the southern outskirts of tehran , khamenei insisted that " iran is no threat to anyone . khame n ei : nuclear weapo n s u n -islamic " we have friendly relations with all the region and asia , " he said .
" we have good and healthy relations with europe , and in the close future , because they need our gas , these relations will become even better .
they accuse us of developing nuclear bombs .
this is an absurd lie .
we do not need nuclear weapons and bombs .
we do n't have any target to use them on . " using nuclear weapons is against islamic rules , " he continued , according to afp news service . " we will not impose the costs of building and maintenance of nuclear weapons on our people .
our explosive source is the power of our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad with a giant poster of khamenei on sunday on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said while ruling out any halt to the country 's enrichment program .

prime minister jiri paroubek 's social democrats , seeking a third term in office , came in second with 32.3 percent , according to official results released by the czech statistical office . although the civic democrats came out on top , they face a difficult challenge in putting together a government as right and left wing forces each won 100 seats in the 200-member lower house of parliament . that task appeared to become even harder after his main election opponent , social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek , said he would propose taking his party into opposition after eight years in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- campaigned with paroubek -lrb- right -rrb- " i will support our move into the opposition , " he said . such a move would rule out the creation of a german-style grand coalition between the two main parties , regarded as one way out of the the post-election deadlock .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 04.06.2006 german fraternities fight right-wing image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protocol and ceremony still attract some german students to join fraternities student fraternities may offer " an escape from the anonymity of university life " , but can they shed their burdensome reputation of being too nationalistic ?
the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .
but in reality , most do turn it down because the price tag on these luxurious living quarters also includes membership in a fraternity , or " studentenverbindung . " " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .
fifty years ago , some 30 percent of all german students belonged to such organizations ; today fraternity members represent between 2 and 3 percent of the total student population .
the traditional practice of intentionally wounding each other in the face with swords while fencing may also have contributed to students ' loss of interest . yet those who do join are not all right-wing extremists , as the stereotype may suggest .
rudi , a 22-year-old student of english and sports , admitted that he had simply " landed in the fraternity by accident " after finding a room there on the internet . cosmopolita n i n n ature ? bernd , another nibelungen resident , painted a rather cosmopolitan picture of the organization -lrb- cocktails aside -rrb- . " just because we 're in a fraternity does n't mean we 're different from everybody else , " he said .
" we have parties here like everyone else too .
and they 're really fun because lots of people come together , different nationalities are there , which makes for a good international mix and that can only mean fun . " the nibelugen house , located near the university in cologne , is international indeed : only two of its six residents are german . vladimir müller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .
but in reality , most do turn it down because the price tag on these luxurious living quarters also includes membership in a fraternity , or " studentenverbindung . " " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .
fifty years ago , some 30 percent of all german students belonged to such organizations ; today fraternity members represent between 2 and 3 percent of the total student population .
the traditional practice of intentionally wounding each other in the face with swords while fencing may also have contributed to students ' loss of interest . yet those who do join are not all right-wing extremists , as the stereotype may suggest .
rudi , a 22-year-old student of english and sports , admitted that he had simply " landed in the fraternity by accident " after finding a room there on the internet . cosmopolita n i n n ature ? bernd , another nibelungen resident , painted a rather cosmopolitan picture of the organization -lrb- cocktails aside -rrb- . " just because we 're in a fraternity does n't mean we 're different from everybody else , " he said .
" we have parties here like everyone else too .
and they 're really fun because lots of people come together , different nationalities are there , which makes for a good international mix and that can only mean fun . " the nibelugen house , located near the university in cologne , is international indeed : only two of its six residents are german . vladimir müller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .

but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .

" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .
but in reality , most do turn it down because the price tag on these luxurious living quarters also includes membership in a fraternity , or " studentenverbindung . " " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .
fifty years ago , some 30 percent of all german students belonged to such organizations ; today fraternity members represent between 2 and 3 percent of the total student population .
the traditional practice of intentionally wounding each other in the face with swords while fencing may also have contributed to students ' loss of interest . yet those who do join are not all right-wing extremists , as the stereotype may suggest .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

" ayatollah ali khamenei also gave the united states a staunch warning that any " mistake " in its dealings with oil-rich iran would lead to consequences for global energy supplies . " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes . " the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany are poised to present iran with an offer of incentives and the prospect of fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspends uranium enrichment . that activity is at the center of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make reactor fuel - and not bombs - and that enrichment is a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . sola n a to travel to tehra n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani during a march meeting in the german embassy in vienna eu foreign policy chief javier solana is expected in tehran in the coming days to present the proposals .
iran has been given just weeks to make up its mind - or else face security council action including possible sanctions . but khamenei added to indications that the offer could end up being dead on arrival by shrugging off any fear of the consequences . " there is no consensus against iran , " he said .
" it is only the americans and some of their allies .
this is all about a political monopoly of energy .
they want others to beg for energy . " speaking at khomeini 's mausoleum on the southern outskirts of tehran , khamenei insisted that " iran is no threat to anyone . khame n ei : nuclear weapo n s u n -islamic " we have friendly relations with all the region and asia , " he said .
" we have good and healthy relations with europe , and in the close future , because they need our gas , these relations will become even better .
they accuse us of developing nuclear bombs .
this is an absurd lie .
we do not need nuclear weapons and bombs .
we do n't have any target to use them on . " using nuclear weapons is against islamic rules , " he continued , according to afp news service . " we will not impose the costs of building and maintenance of nuclear weapons on our people .
our explosive source is the power of our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad with a giant poster of khamenei on sunday on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said while ruling out any halt to the country 's enrichment program . " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence , " he said , according to news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister urges iran to consider nuclear offer speaking in turkey , germany 's foreign minister on friday urged iran to carefully study proposals by western powers that would help resolve the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .
-lrb- june 2 , 2006 -rrb- world powers agree on deal , wait on iran after agreeing to a landmark package intended to lure iran to cease its nuclear activities , key world powers are waiting to see what the islamic nation has to say .

the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .
but in reality , most do turn it down because the price tag on these luxurious living quarters also includes membership in a fraternity , or " studentenverbindung . " " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .
fifty years ago , some 30 percent of all german students belonged to such organizations ; today fraternity members represent between 2 and 3 percent of the total student population .
the traditional practice of intentionally wounding each other in the face with swords while fencing may also have contributed to students ' loss of interest . yet those who do join are not all right-wing extremists , as the stereotype may suggest .
rudi , a 22-year-old student of english and sports , admitted that he had simply " landed in the fraternity by accident " after finding a room there on the internet . cosmopolita n i n n ature ? bernd , another nibelungen resident , painted a rather cosmopolitan picture of the organization -lrb- cocktails aside -rrb- . " just because we 're in a fraternity does n't mean we 're different from everybody else , " he said .
" we have parties here like everyone else too .
and they 're really fun because lots of people come together , different nationalities are there , which makes for a good international mix and that can only mean fun . " the nibelugen house , located near the university in cologne , is international indeed : only two of its six residents are german . vladimir müller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 04.06.2006 german fraternities fight right-wing image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protocol and ceremony still attract some german students to join fraternities student fraternities may offer " an escape from the anonymity of university life " , but can they shed their burdensome reputation of being too nationalistic ?
the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .
but in reality , most do turn it down because the price tag on these luxurious living quarters also includes membership in a fraternity , or " studentenverbindung . " " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .
fifty years ago , some 30 percent of all german students belonged to such organizations ; today fraternity members represent between 2 and 3 percent of the total student population .
the traditional practice of intentionally wounding each other in the face with swords while fencing may also have contributed to students ' loss of interest . yet those who do join are not all right-wing extremists , as the stereotype may suggest .
rudi , a 22-year-old student of english and sports , admitted that he had simply " landed in the fraternity by accident " after finding a room there on the internet . cosmopolita n i n n ature ? bernd , another nibelungen resident , painted a rather cosmopolitan picture of the organization -lrb- cocktails aside -rrb- . " just because we 're in a fraternity does n't mean we 're different from everybody else , " he said .
" we have parties here like everyone else too .
and they 're really fun because lots of people come together , different nationalities are there , which makes for a good international mix and that can only mean fun . " the nibelugen house , located near the university in cologne , is international indeed : only two of its six residents are german . vladimir müller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold vintners toast german wine 's popularity german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations europe -pipe- 04.06.2006 eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winemakers will be asked to change the way they operate vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina . the reform plans are being finalized by eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel , who wants to encourage producers to abandon some of the vineyards and put the focus on better quality wines , thereby putting supply more in line with demand . " i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .

the european union wants other country 's talent to come here but the eu 's requirements for them to study and research in europe resemble an obstacle course . the european union is in intense competition with others , particularly the united states , for young , bright academics .
students from developing countries are wanted to help increase the quality and reputation of european universities and research institutes . but what education experts in the eu demand varies radically from what brussels ' bureaucratic measures require of fellowship or exchange program applicants .
sometimes , the obstacles are so great that some college students give up out of sheer frustration . health i n sura n ce , apartme n t a n d large sums of mo n ey required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scientific research needs minds from around the globe valentina dimitrovska , a 27-year old biologist from skopje , macedonia , knows the procedure first-hand . an italian research institute had invited her for a two-year stay .
the only thing missing was a visa from the italian government .
the appointment at the embassy in skopje , which she had to wait two weeks for , would make determine her fate for the next two years .
for the moment , she wore the best clothing she had : dark slacks , white blouse , and a blazer .
the room for error should be minimalized as much as possible . " you have to have all your papers - there are some 40 - to prove to the embassy that you do n't want to spend the rest of your life in italym , " she said .
" you have to prove to the embassy staff that you are coming back to macedonia .
at the moment i am unemployed , so it was difficult to convince them that i was honest . " to underscore her veracity , she read from an embassy brochure what she needed : a permanent residence in macedonia , the parents have to be wage-earners , health insurance , and last but not least , a large sum of money in a bank account . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all macedonians want to leave their capital , skopje , permanently for young scholars at the start of their careers , the last point is frequently next to impossible to fulfill : dimitrovska , like many young macedonians , still lives at home with her sister and parents . " then they wanted me to prove that my mother works and has money , " she said .
" my father is already retired , so i had to show his last three pay slips . " eu wa n ts to have its cake a n d to eat it too lawmakers in brussels , such as ewa klamt , a member of the conservative european people 's party in the european parliament and expert for immigration issues , realize that the bar is set much too high for most academics coming from developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament seeks students but has high demands " exactly very intelligent people , people who are ready to break out into the world , people with knowledge , finally reach the conclusion : ' i do n't have to wait an eternity for a visa for the european union .
i can go to the us or canada .
i 'm wanted there , i can do my research , i can work , " ' she said . yet her beliefs of making the eu easier to enter for students and researchers are not shared by the majority .
klamt does n't understand that lawmakers would claim that europe is not a continent of immigrants , or that germany is not a country of immigrants . " in reality , there is constant movement , " she said .
" people are coming to us and people are leaving . " visa i n the pocket dimitrovska passed the rigorous test at the italian embassy and was granted her visa .
but the whole experience has left a bad taste in her mouth . " i feel like i 've been discriminated , " she said .
" our country 's reputation may be bad but here -lrb- at the embassy -rrb- my dignity was pushed to the limit .
you just lose courage when you see all that they want .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .

but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .

" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .

the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .
but in reality , most do turn it down because the price tag on these luxurious living quarters also includes membership in a fraternity , or " studentenverbindung . " " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .
fifty years ago , some 30 percent of all german students belonged to such organizations ; today fraternity members represent between 2 and 3 percent of the total student population .
the traditional practice of intentionally wounding each other in the face with swords while fencing may also have contributed to students ' loss of interest . yet those who do join are not all right-wing extremists , as the stereotype may suggest .
rudi , a 22-year-old student of english and sports , admitted that he had simply " landed in the fraternity by accident " after finding a room there on the internet . cosmopolita n i n n ature ? bernd , another nibelungen resident , painted a rather cosmopolitan picture of the organization -lrb- cocktails aside -rrb- .

prime minister jiri paroubek 's social democrats , seeking a third term in office , came in second with 32.3 percent , according to official results released by the czech statistical office . although the civic democrats came out on top , they face a difficult challenge in putting together a government as right and left wing forces each won 100 seats in the 200-member lower house of parliament . that task appeared to become even harder after his main election opponent , social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek , said he would propose taking his party into opposition after eight years in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- campaigned with paroubek -lrb- right -rrb- " i will support our move into the opposition , " he said . such a move would rule out the creation of a german-style grand coalition between the two main parties , regarded as one way out of the the post-election deadlock .

the social democrats won 74 seats and the communists 26 .
the greens have said they will not join any coalition with the communists . mulli n g the optio n s communist leaders have already suggested forming a government of national unity , but such a step is unlikely as all other parties have ruled out coalitions with the communists . " it is a complete deadlock , " political analyst jiri pehe told afp news service , adding that a german-style grand coalition between topolanek 's civic democrats and prime minister jiri paroubek 's left-wing social democrats might be the only solution - something both parties have said they would not do . " the election campaign was extremely nasty .
politicians have dug trenches between themselves that are so deep it will be difficult to cross them now , " pehe said , adding topolanek and paroubek might have to step aside to make a coalition possible .
he also said that the alternative was to hold new elections . preside n t favors co n servatives without waiting for the count to be completed and the final allocation of seats to be announced , president vaclav klaus on saturday said he would invite the civic democrats to launch negotiations over the formation of a government on monday . the head of the largest party in parliament is usually given the first chance to try and form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exit polls : czech conservatives win elections the right-wing civic democratic party of mirek topolanek was predicted to win legislative elections in the czech republic on saturday with 38 percent of the vote , according to a first forecast .

but who could ever picture merkel donning a fashionable track suit like the one sported by schröder ?
not that merkel has not been known to wear the odd fashion faux pas here and there , but the former chancellor even had a nickname - " field " - as an amateur soccer player and longingly used to watch a couple of guys kicking a ball around underneath his office window . froze n behi n ds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the women 's dfb cup finals in berlin in april well , madam chancellor seems to have proven that assumption is not the best tactic when judging other people .
since taking office , she 's attended several soccer games and in a story in the current issue of der spiegel , she outed herself as a someone whose interest in soccer goes beyond the level that 's obligatory for any politician and especially the leader of a country that 's about to host the world cup . " i 'm in a no-win situation as far as this issue is concerned , " she said , adding that she 's been a soccer fan since the age of seven .
the fact that she ended up with a frozen behind while watching east germany play england in leipzig in 1974 probably also wo n't help her to establish herself as a serious fan , merkel apparently told the magazine 's reporter before going on to share her analysis of the state of germany 's national team . a n gela 's " tip " yet - despite all her expertise - she 's still the chancellor and knows that an objective assessment of germany 's chances can only go so far . " i have organized my schedule in such a way that i could watch every match germany plays , including the final , " she told bild am so n n tag tabloid , avoiding the wrath of her countrymen , who will not be quite as lucky - let alone watch the games live in the stadiums . germa n y 's first soccer widower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer will come on vacation , but he wo n't take up precious stadium seats but there 's at least one thing that merkel shares with most male soccer fans - the lack of spousal support . her husband , joachim sauer , a professor of chemistry , is unlikely to accompany merkel to the games as she tends to be the greater soccer enthusiast in the family , she said . " he says that the tickets are already scarce and therefore he does n't just want to come along for reasons of protocol , " merkel added . looks like there will be at least one free seat left next to the chancelloress .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .

the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .
but in reality , most do turn it down because the price tag on these luxurious living quarters also includes membership in a fraternity , or " studentenverbindung . " " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .
fifty years ago , some 30 percent of all german students belonged to such organizations ; today fraternity members represent between 2 and 3 percent of the total student population .
the traditional practice of intentionally wounding each other in the face with swords while fencing may also have contributed to students ' loss of interest . yet those who do join are not all right-wing extremists , as the stereotype may suggest .
rudi , a 22-year-old student of english and sports , admitted that he had simply " landed in the fraternity by accident " after finding a room there on the internet . cosmopolita n i n n ature ? bernd , another nibelungen resident , painted a rather cosmopolitan picture of the organization -lrb- cocktails aside -rrb- . " just because we 're in a fraternity does n't mean we 're different from everybody else , " he said .
" we have parties here like everyone else too .
and they 're really fun because lots of people come together , different nationalities are there , which makes for a good international mix and that can only mean fun . " the nibelugen house , located near the university in cologne , is international indeed : only two of its six residents are german . vladimir müller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .

" ayatollah ali khamenei also gave the united states a staunch warning that any " mistake " in its dealings with oil-rich iran would lead to consequences for global energy supplies . " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes . " the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany are poised to present iran with an offer of incentives and the prospect of fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspends uranium enrichment . that activity is at the center of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make reactor fuel - and not bombs - and that enrichment is a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . sola n a to travel to tehra n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani during a march meeting in the german embassy in vienna eu foreign policy chief javier solana is expected in tehran in the coming days to present the proposals .
iran has been given just weeks to make up its mind - or else face security council action including possible sanctions . but khamenei added to indications that the offer could end up being dead on arrival by shrugging off any fear of the consequences . " there is no consensus against iran , " he said .
" it is only the americans and some of their allies .
this is all about a political monopoly of energy .
they want others to beg for energy . " speaking at khomeini 's mausoleum on the southern outskirts of tehran , khamenei insisted that " iran is no threat to anyone . khame n ei : nuclear weapo n s u n -islamic " we have friendly relations with all the region and asia , " he said .
" we have good and healthy relations with europe , and in the close future , because they need our gas , these relations will become even better .
they accuse us of developing nuclear bombs .
this is an absurd lie .
we do not need nuclear weapons and bombs .
we do n't have any target to use them on . " using nuclear weapons is against islamic rules , " he continued , according to afp news service . " we will not impose the costs of building and maintenance of nuclear weapons on our people .
our explosive source is the power of our faith .

students from developing countries are wanted to help increase the quality and reputation of european universities and research institutes . but what education experts in the eu demand varies radically from what brussels ' bureaucratic measures require of fellowship or exchange program applicants .

" ayatollah ali khamenei also gave the united states a staunch warning that any " mistake " in its dealings with oil-rich iran would lead to consequences for global energy supplies . " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes . " the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany are poised to present iran with an offer of incentives and the prospect of fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspends uranium enrichment . that activity is at the center of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make reactor fuel - and not bombs - and that enrichment is a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . sola n a to travel to tehra n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani during a march meeting in the german embassy in vienna eu foreign policy chief javier solana is expected in tehran in the coming days to present the proposals .
iran has been given just weeks to make up its mind - or else face security council action including possible sanctions . but khamenei added to indications that the offer could end up being dead on arrival by shrugging off any fear of the consequences . " there is no consensus against iran , " he said .
" it is only the americans and some of their allies .
this is all about a political monopoly of energy .
they want others to beg for energy . " speaking at khomeini 's mausoleum on the southern outskirts of tehran , khamenei insisted that " iran is no threat to anyone . khame n ei : nuclear weapo n s u n -islamic " we have friendly relations with all the region and asia , " he said .
" we have good and healthy relations with europe , and in the close future , because they need our gas , these relations will become even better .
they accuse us of developing nuclear bombs .
this is an absurd lie .
we do not need nuclear weapons and bombs .
we do n't have any target to use them on . " using nuclear weapons is against islamic rules , " he continued , according to afp news service . " we will not impose the costs of building and maintenance of nuclear weapons on our people .
our explosive source is the power of our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad with a giant poster of khamenei on sunday on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said while ruling out any halt to the country 's enrichment program . " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence , " he said , according to news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister urges iran to consider nuclear offer speaking in turkey , germany 's foreign minister on friday urged iran to carefully study proposals by western powers that would help resolve the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .

prime minister jiri paroubek 's social democrats , seeking a third term in office , came in second with 32.3 percent , according to official results released by the czech statistical office . although the civic democrats came out on top , they face a difficult challenge in putting together a government as right and left wing forces each won 100 seats in the 200-member lower house of parliament . that task appeared to become even harder after his main election opponent , social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek , said he would propose taking his party into opposition after eight years in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- campaigned with paroubek -lrb- right -rrb- " i will support our move into the opposition , " he said . such a move would rule out the creation of a german-style grand coalition between the two main parties , regarded as one way out of the the post-election deadlock .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .

the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .

" ayatollah ali khamenei also gave the united states a staunch warning that any " mistake " in its dealings with oil-rich iran would lead to consequences for global energy supplies . " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes . " the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany are poised to present iran with an offer of incentives and the prospect of fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspends uranium enrichment . that activity is at the center of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .

iran has been given just weeks to make up its mind - or else face security council action including possible sanctions . but khamenei added to indications that the offer could end up being dead on arrival by shrugging off any fear of the consequences . " there is no consensus against iran , " he said .
" it is only the americans and some of their allies .
this is all about a political monopoly of energy .
they want others to beg for energy . " speaking at khomeini 's mausoleum on the southern outskirts of tehran , khamenei insisted that " iran is no threat to anyone . khame n ei : nuclear weapo n s u n -islamic " we have friendly relations with all the region and asia , " he said .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

" ayatollah ali khamenei also gave the united states a staunch warning that any " mistake " in its dealings with oil-rich iran would lead to consequences for global energy supplies . " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes . " the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany are poised to present iran with an offer of incentives and the prospect of fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspends uranium enrichment . that activity is at the center of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make reactor fuel - and not bombs - and that enrichment is a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . sola n a to travel to tehra n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani during a march meeting in the german embassy in vienna eu foreign policy chief javier solana is expected in tehran in the coming days to present the proposals .
iran has been given just weeks to make up its mind - or else face security council action including possible sanctions . but khamenei added to indications that the offer could end up being dead on arrival by shrugging off any fear of the consequences . " there is no consensus against iran , " he said .
" it is only the americans and some of their allies .
this is all about a political monopoly of energy .
they want others to beg for energy . " speaking at khomeini 's mausoleum on the southern outskirts of tehran , khamenei insisted that " iran is no threat to anyone . khame n ei : nuclear weapo n s u n -islamic " we have friendly relations with all the region and asia , " he said .
" we have good and healthy relations with europe , and in the close future , because they need our gas , these relations will become even better .
they accuse us of developing nuclear bombs .
this is an absurd lie .
we do not need nuclear weapons and bombs .
we do n't have any target to use them on . " using nuclear weapons is against islamic rules , " he continued , according to afp news service . " we will not impose the costs of building and maintenance of nuclear weapons on our people .
our explosive source is the power of our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad with a giant poster of khamenei on sunday on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said while ruling out any halt to the country 's enrichment program .

prime minister jiri paroubek 's social democrats , seeking a third term in office , came in second with 32.3 percent , according to official results released by the czech statistical office . although the civic democrats came out on top , they face a difficult challenge in putting together a government as right and left wing forces each won 100 seats in the 200-member lower house of parliament . that task appeared to become even harder after his main election opponent , social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek , said he would propose taking his party into opposition after eight years in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- campaigned with paroubek -lrb- right -rrb- " i will support our move into the opposition , " he said . such a move would rule out the creation of a german-style grand coalition between the two main parties , regarded as one way out of the the post-election deadlock .
topolanek accused paroubek of " having an interest in a new election by questioning the last one . " the official results showed that the civic democrats won 81 seats and their christian democrat allies 13 .
with the probable support of six green deputies the right could muster only 100 votes .
the social democrats won 74 seats and the communists 26 .
the greens have said they will not join any coalition with the communists . mulli n g the optio n s communist leaders have already suggested forming a government of national unity , but such a step is unlikely as all other parties have ruled out coalitions with the communists . " it is a complete deadlock , " political analyst jiri pehe told afp news service , adding that a german-style grand coalition between topolanek 's civic democrats and prime minister jiri paroubek 's left-wing social democrats might be the only solution - something both parties have said they would not do . " the election campaign was extremely nasty .
politicians have dug trenches between themselves that are so deep it will be difficult to cross them now , " pehe said , adding topolanek and paroubek might have to step aside to make a coalition possible .
he also said that the alternative was to hold new elections . preside n t favors co n servatives without waiting for the count to be completed and the final allocation of seats to be announced , president vaclav klaus on saturday said he would invite the civic democrats to launch negotiations over the formation of a government on monday . the head of the largest party in parliament is usually given the first chance to try and form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exit polls : czech conservatives win elections the right-wing civic democratic party of mirek topolanek was predicted to win legislative elections in the czech republic on saturday with 38 percent of the vote , according to a first forecast .

prime minister jiri paroubek 's social democrats , seeking a third term in office , came in second with 32.3 percent , according to official results released by the czech statistical office . although the civic democrats came out on top , they face a difficult challenge in putting together a government as right and left wing forces each won 100 seats in the 200-member lower house of parliament . that task appeared to become even harder after his main election opponent , social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek , said he would propose taking his party into opposition after eight years in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- campaigned with paroubek -lrb- right -rrb- " i will support our move into the opposition , " he said . such a move would rule out the creation of a german-style grand coalition between the two main parties , regarded as one way out of the the post-election deadlock .
topolanek accused paroubek of " having an interest in a new election by questioning the last one . " the official results showed that the civic democrats won 81 seats and their christian democrat allies 13 .
with the probable support of six green deputies the right could muster only 100 votes .
the social democrats won 74 seats and the communists 26 .
the greens have said they will not join any coalition with the communists . mulli n g the optio n s communist leaders have already suggested forming a government of national unity , but such a step is unlikely as all other parties have ruled out coalitions with the communists . " it is a complete deadlock , " political analyst jiri pehe told afp news service , adding that a german-style grand coalition between topolanek 's civic democrats and prime minister jiri paroubek 's left-wing social democrats might be the only solution - something both parties have said they would not do . " the election campaign was extremely nasty .
politicians have dug trenches between themselves that are so deep it will be difficult to cross them now , " pehe said , adding topolanek and paroubek might have to step aside to make a coalition possible .
he also said that the alternative was to hold new elections . preside n t favors co n servatives without waiting for the count to be completed and the final allocation of seats to be announced , president vaclav klaus on saturday said he would invite the civic democrats to launch negotiations over the formation of a government on monday . the head of the largest party in parliament is usually given the first chance to try and form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exit polls : czech conservatives win elections the right-wing civic democratic party of mirek topolanek was predicted to win legislative elections in the czech republic on saturday with 38 percent of the vote , according to a first forecast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 04.06.2006 " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger says he is relaxed and is anticipating a successful world cup theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .
that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .

a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .

but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .

the european union wants other country 's talent to come here but the eu 's requirements for them to study and research in europe resemble an obstacle course . the european union is in intense competition with others , particularly the united states , for young , bright academics .
students from developing countries are wanted to help increase the quality and reputation of european universities and research institutes . but what education experts in the eu demand varies radically from what brussels ' bureaucratic measures require of fellowship or exchange program applicants .
sometimes , the obstacles are so great that some college students give up out of sheer frustration . health i n sura n ce , apartme n t a n d large sums of mo n ey required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scientific research needs minds from around the globe valentina dimitrovska , a 27-year old biologist from skopje , macedonia , knows the procedure first-hand . an italian research institute had invited her for a two-year stay .
the only thing missing was a visa from the italian government .
the appointment at the embassy in skopje , which she had to wait two weeks for , would make determine her fate for the next two years .
for the moment , she wore the best clothing she had : dark slacks , white blouse , and a blazer .
the room for error should be minimalized as much as possible . " you have to have all your papers - there are some 40 - to prove to the embassy that you do n't want to spend the rest of your life in italym , " she said .
" you have to prove to the embassy staff that you are coming back to macedonia .
at the moment i am unemployed , so it was difficult to convince them that i was honest . " to underscore her veracity , she read from an embassy brochure what she needed : a permanent residence in macedonia , the parents have to be wage-earners , health insurance , and last but not least , a large sum of money in a bank account . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all macedonians want to leave their capital , skopje , permanently for young scholars at the start of their careers , the last point is frequently next to impossible to fulfill : dimitrovska , like many young macedonians , still lives at home with her sister and parents . " then they wanted me to prove that my mother works and has money , " she said .
" my father is already retired , so i had to show his last three pay slips . " eu wa n ts to have its cake a n d to eat it too lawmakers in brussels , such as ewa klamt , a member of the conservative european people 's party in the european parliament and expert for immigration issues , realize that the bar is set much too high for most academics coming from developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament seeks students but has high demands " exactly very intelligent people , people who are ready to break out into the world , people with knowledge , finally reach the conclusion : ' i do n't have to wait an eternity for a visa for the european union .
i can go to the us or canada .
i 'm wanted there , i can do my research , i can work , " ' she said . yet her beliefs of making the eu easier to enter for students and researchers are not shared by the majority .
klamt does n't understand that lawmakers would claim that europe is not a continent of immigrants , or that germany is not a country of immigrants . " in reality , there is constant movement , " she said .
" people are coming to us and people are leaving . " visa i n the pocket dimitrovska passed the rigorous test at the italian embassy and was granted her visa .
but the whole experience has left a bad taste in her mouth . " i feel like i 've been discriminated , " she said .
" our country 's reputation may be bad but here -lrb- at the embassy -rrb- my dignity was pushed to the limit .
you just lose courage when you see all that they want .
who do they think i am ?
a thief ?
a terrorist ?

the room for error should be minimalized as much as possible . " you have to have all your papers - there are some 40 - to prove to the embassy that you do n't want to spend the rest of your life in italym , " she said .
" you have to prove to the embassy staff that you are coming back to macedonia .
at the moment i am unemployed , so it was difficult to convince them that i was honest . " to underscore her veracity , she read from an embassy brochure what she needed : a permanent residence in macedonia , the parents have to be wage-earners , health insurance , and last but not least , a large sum of money in a bank account . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all macedonians want to leave their capital , skopje , permanently for young scholars at the start of their careers , the last point is frequently next to impossible to fulfill : dimitrovska , like many young macedonians , still lives at home with her sister and parents . " then they wanted me to prove that my mother works and has money , " she said .
" my father is already retired , so i had to show his last three pay slips . " eu wa n ts to have its cake a n d to eat it too lawmakers in brussels , such as ewa klamt , a member of the conservative european people 's party in the european parliament and expert for immigration issues , realize that the bar is set much too high for most academics coming from developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament seeks students but has high demands " exactly very intelligent people , people who are ready to break out into the world , people with knowledge , finally reach the conclusion : ' i do n't have to wait an eternity for a visa for the european union .
i can go to the us or canada .
i 'm wanted there , i can do my research , i can work , " ' she said . yet her beliefs of making the eu easier to enter for students and researchers are not shared by the majority .
klamt does n't understand that lawmakers would claim that europe is not a continent of immigrants , or that germany is not a country of immigrants . " in reality , there is constant movement , " she said .
" people are coming to us and people are leaving . " visa i n the pocket dimitrovska passed the rigorous test at the italian embassy and was granted her visa .
but the whole experience has left a bad taste in her mouth . " i feel like i 've been discriminated , " she said .
" our country 's reputation may be bad but here -lrb- at the embassy -rrb- my dignity was pushed to the limit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 04.06.2006 german fraternities fight right-wing image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protocol and ceremony still attract some german students to join fraternities student fraternities may offer " an escape from the anonymity of university life " , but can they shed their burdensome reputation of being too nationalistic ?
the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .
but in reality , most do turn it down because the price tag on these luxurious living quarters also includes membership in a fraternity , or " studentenverbindung . " " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .

" ayatollah ali khamenei also gave the united states a staunch warning that any " mistake " in its dealings with oil-rich iran would lead to consequences for global energy supplies . " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes . " the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany are poised to present iran with an offer of incentives and the prospect of fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspends uranium enrichment . that activity is at the center of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make reactor fuel - and not bombs - and that enrichment is a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . sola n a to travel to tehra n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani during a march meeting in the german embassy in vienna eu foreign policy chief javier solana is expected in tehran in the coming days to present the proposals .
iran has been given just weeks to make up its mind - or else face security council action including possible sanctions . but khamenei added to indications that the offer could end up being dead on arrival by shrugging off any fear of the consequences . " there is no consensus against iran , " he said .
" it is only the americans and some of their allies .
this is all about a political monopoly of energy .
they want others to beg for energy . " speaking at khomeini 's mausoleum on the southern outskirts of tehran , khamenei insisted that " iran is no threat to anyone . khame n ei : nuclear weapo n s u n -islamic " we have friendly relations with all the region and asia , " he said .
" we have good and healthy relations with europe , and in the close future , because they need our gas , these relations will become even better .
they accuse us of developing nuclear bombs .
this is an absurd lie .
we do not need nuclear weapons and bombs .
we do n't have any target to use them on . " using nuclear weapons is against islamic rules , " he continued , according to afp news service . " we will not impose the costs of building and maintenance of nuclear weapons on our people .
our explosive source is the power of our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad with a giant poster of khamenei on sunday on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said while ruling out any halt to the country 's enrichment program . " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence , " he said , according to news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister urges iran to consider nuclear offer speaking in turkey , germany 's foreign minister on friday urged iran to carefully study proposals by western powers that would help resolve the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

not that merkel has not been known to wear the odd fashion faux pas here and there , but the former chancellor even had a nickname - " field " - as an amateur soccer player and longingly used to watch a couple of guys kicking a ball around underneath his office window . froze n behi n ds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the women 's dfb cup finals in berlin in april well , madam chancellor seems to have proven that assumption is not the best tactic when judging other people .
since taking office , she 's attended several soccer games and in a story in the current issue of der spiegel , she outed herself as a someone whose interest in soccer goes beyond the level that 's obligatory for any politician and especially the leader of a country that 's about to host the world cup . " i 'm in a no-win situation as far as this issue is concerned , " she said , adding that she 's been a soccer fan since the age of seven .
the fact that she ended up with a frozen behind while watching east germany play england in leipzig in 1974 probably also wo n't help her to establish herself as a serious fan , merkel apparently told the magazine 's reporter before going on to share her analysis of the state of germany 's national team . a n gela 's " tip " yet - despite all her expertise - she 's still the chancellor and knows that an objective assessment of germany 's chances can only go so far . " i have organized my schedule in such a way that i could watch every match germany plays , including the final , " she told bild am so n n tag tabloid , avoiding the wrath of her countrymen , who will not be quite as lucky - let alone watch the games live in the stadiums . germa n y 's first soccer widower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer will come on vacation , but he wo n't take up precious stadium seats but there 's at least one thing that merkel shares with most male soccer fans - the lack of spousal support . her husband , joachim sauer , a professor of chemistry , is unlikely to accompany merkel to the games as she tends to be the greater soccer enthusiast in the family , she said . " he says that the tickets are already scarce and therefore he does n't just want to come along for reasons of protocol , " merkel added . looks like there will be at least one free seat left next to the chancelloress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold vintners toast german wine 's popularity german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations europe -pipe- 04.06.2006 eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winemakers will be asked to change the way they operate vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina . the reform plans are being finalized by eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel , who wants to encourage producers to abandon some of the vineyards and put the focus on better quality wines , thereby putting supply more in line with demand . " i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

the members of the nibelungen fraternity in cologne think so . a spacious room in a beautifully restored 19th century house , with an internet connection in your room , the university at your doorstep and a monthly rent that is half the going rate - for most students , it should seem like a dream come true .

" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes . " the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany are poised to present iran with an offer of incentives and the prospect of fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspends uranium enrichment . that activity is at the center of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2006 czechs faced with political stalemate after election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain times ahead for czech election winner topolanek czech politicians started talks sunday to overcome a stalemate for forming a future government after legislative elections resulted in a tie between the left and the right . the civic democrats , led by mirek topolanek , emerged as the biggest single party with 35.4 percent of the popular vote after the two-day election which wound up saturday .
prime minister jiri paroubek 's social democrats , seeking a third term in office , came in second with 32.3 percent , according to official results released by the czech statistical office . although the civic democrats came out on top , they face a difficult challenge in putting together a government as right and left wing forces each won 100 seats in the 200-member lower house of parliament . that task appeared to become even harder after his main election opponent , social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek , said he would propose taking his party into opposition after eight years in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- campaigned with paroubek -lrb- right -rrb- " i will support our move into the opposition , " he said . such a move would rule out the creation of a german-style grand coalition between the two main parties , regarded as one way out of the the post-election deadlock .
topolanek accused paroubek of " having an interest in a new election by questioning the last one . " the official results showed that the civic democrats won 81 seats and their christian democrat allies 13 .
with the probable support of six green deputies the right could muster only 100 votes .
the social democrats won 74 seats and the communists 26 .
the greens have said they will not join any coalition with the communists . mulli n g the optio n s communist leaders have already suggested forming a government of national unity , but such a step is unlikely as all other parties have ruled out coalitions with the communists . " it is a complete deadlock , " political analyst jiri pehe told afp news service , adding that a german-style grand coalition between topolanek 's civic democrats and prime minister jiri paroubek 's left-wing social democrats might be the only solution - something both parties have said they would not do . " the election campaign was extremely nasty .
politicians have dug trenches between themselves that are so deep it will be difficult to cross them now , " pehe said , adding topolanek and paroubek might have to step aside to make a coalition possible .
he also said that the alternative was to hold new elections . preside n t favors co n servatives without waiting for the count to be completed and the final allocation of seats to be announced , president vaclav klaus on saturday said he would invite the civic democrats to launch negotiations over the formation of a government on monday . the head of the largest party in parliament is usually given the first chance to try and form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exit polls : czech conservatives win elections the right-wing civic democratic party of mirek topolanek was predicted to win legislative elections in the czech republic on saturday with 38 percent of the vote , according to a first forecast .

we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold vintners toast german wine 's popularity german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations europe -pipe- 04.06.2006 eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winemakers will be asked to change the way they operate vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina . the reform plans are being finalized by eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel , who wants to encourage producers to abandon some of the vineyards and put the focus on better quality wines , thereby putting supply more in line with demand . " i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny . the germa n soccer federatio n 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- chief executive theo zwa n ziger is the vice preside n t of the germa n world cup orga n izi n g committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . dw-tv : mr. zwa n ziger , the a n ticipatio n 's mou n ti n g .
the world is looki n g forward to the world cup fi n als i n germa n y .
is it affecti n g your sleep ?
theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

the fact that she ended up with a frozen behind while watching east germany play england in leipzig in 1974 probably also wo n't help her to establish herself as a serious fan , merkel apparently told the magazine 's reporter before going on to share her analysis of the state of germany 's national team . a n gela 's " tip " yet - despite all her expertise - she 's still the chancellor and knows that an objective assessment of germany 's chances can only go so far . " i have organized my schedule in such a way that i could watch every match germany plays , including the final , " she told bild am so n n tag tabloid , avoiding the wrath of her countrymen , who will not be quite as lucky - let alone watch the games live in the stadiums . germa n y 's first soccer widower bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer will come on vacation , but he wo n't take up precious stadium seats but there 's at least one thing that merkel shares with most male soccer fans - the lack of spousal support . her husband , joachim sauer , a professor of chemistry , is unlikely to accompany merkel to the games as she tends to be the greater soccer enthusiast in the family , she said . " he says that the tickets are already scarce and therefore he does n't just want to come along for reasons of protocol , " merkel added . looks like there will be at least one free seat left next to the chancelloress .

theo zwanziger : no , i 'm sleeping well .
we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2006 czechs faced with political stalemate after election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain times ahead for czech election winner topolanek czech politicians started talks sunday to overcome a stalemate for forming a future government after legislative elections resulted in a tie between the left and the right . the civic democrats , led by mirek topolanek , emerged as the biggest single party with 35.4 percent of the popular vote after the two-day election which wound up saturday .
prime minister jiri paroubek 's social democrats , seeking a third term in office , came in second with 32.3 percent , according to official results released by the czech statistical office . although the civic democrats came out on top , they face a difficult challenge in putting together a government as right and left wing forces each won 100 seats in the 200-member lower house of parliament . that task appeared to become even harder after his main election opponent , social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek , said he would propose taking his party into opposition after eight years in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- campaigned with paroubek -lrb- right -rrb- " i will support our move into the opposition , " he said . such a move would rule out the creation of a german-style grand coalition between the two main parties , regarded as one way out of the the post-election deadlock .
topolanek accused paroubek of " having an interest in a new election by questioning the last one . " the official results showed that the civic democrats won 81 seats and their christian democrat allies 13 .
with the probable support of six green deputies the right could muster only 100 votes .
the social democrats won 74 seats and the communists 26 .
the greens have said they will not join any coalition with the communists . mulli n g the optio n s communist leaders have already suggested forming a government of national unity , but such a step is unlikely as all other parties have ruled out coalitions with the communists . " it is a complete deadlock , " political analyst jiri pehe told afp news service , adding that a german-style grand coalition between topolanek 's civic democrats and prime minister jiri paroubek 's left-wing social democrats might be the only solution - something both parties have said they would not do . " the election campaign was extremely nasty .
politicians have dug trenches between themselves that are so deep it will be difficult to cross them now , " pehe said , adding topolanek and paroubek might have to step aside to make a coalition possible .
he also said that the alternative was to hold new elections . preside n t favors co n servatives without waiting for the count to be completed and the final allocation of seats to be announced , president vaclav klaus on saturday said he would invite the civic democrats to launch negotiations over the formation of a government on monday . the head of the largest party in parliament is usually given the first chance to try and form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exit polls : czech conservatives win elections the right-wing civic democratic party of mirek topolanek was predicted to win legislative elections in the czech republic on saturday with 38 percent of the vote , according to a first forecast .

" ayatollah ali khamenei also gave the united states a staunch warning that any " mistake " in its dealings with oil-rich iran would lead to consequences for global energy supplies . " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .

" ayatollah ali khamenei also gave the united states a staunch warning that any " mistake " in its dealings with oil-rich iran would lead to consequences for global energy supplies . " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .
" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes . " the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany are poised to present iran with an offer of incentives and the prospect of fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspends uranium enrichment . that activity is at the center of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make reactor fuel - and not bombs - and that enrichment is a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . sola n a to travel to tehra n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani during a march meeting in the german embassy in vienna eu foreign policy chief javier solana is expected in tehran in the coming days to present the proposals .
iran has been given just weeks to make up its mind - or else face security council action including possible sanctions . but khamenei added to indications that the offer could end up being dead on arrival by shrugging off any fear of the consequences . " there is no consensus against iran , " he said .
" it is only the americans and some of their allies .
this is all about a political monopoly of energy .
they want others to beg for energy . " speaking at khomeini 's mausoleum on the southern outskirts of tehran , khamenei insisted that " iran is no threat to anyone . khame n ei : nuclear weapo n s u n -islamic " we have friendly relations with all the region and asia , " he said .
" we have good and healthy relations with europe , and in the close future , because they need our gas , these relations will become even better .
they accuse us of developing nuclear bombs .
this is an absurd lie .
we do not need nuclear weapons and bombs .
we do n't have any target to use them on . " using nuclear weapons is against islamic rules , " he continued , according to afp news service . " we will not impose the costs of building and maintenance of nuclear weapons on our people .
our explosive source is the power of our faith . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad with a giant poster of khamenei on sunday on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said while ruling out any halt to the country 's enrichment program .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

" " freedom , honor and the fatherland " may sound a bit old-fashioned , but in fact there are over 2,000 student fraternities in germany that strive to uphold similar mottos .
german fraternities have the reputation of being ultra-conservative , not only because they have been around for more than 200 years , foster traditional values and are almost exclusively all-male , but also because they tend to promote german nationalist sentiment . germa n u n ificatio n as motivatio n since world war ii , nationalism has been a four-letter word in germany .
the german flag has suffered an unspoken ban - though the upcoming soccer world cup has brought about an unprecedented rebirth of black , red and gold .
what in other countries may be considered healthy patriotism is quick to be condemned in germany as right-wing extremism . hans-joachim franke , a former resident of " nibelungen , " a catholic fraternity in cologne , said the fraternities ' nationalist character had historic roots . " patriotically minded students , who supported the unification of what were then individual german states , came together and created fraternal organizations , " he said .
" many of them were even prosecuted for advocating democracy in germany . " decreasi n g memberships in fact , the german fraternities have been identified as being so liberal in the european sense - that is , conservative - that the left-wing social democratic party recently decided that membership in a fraternity is not compatible with membership in their party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vast majority of germany 's 2,000 fraternities are all-male the fraternities ' old school reputation has become an albatross around their necks and led to drastic decreases in membership .
fifty years ago , some 30 percent of all german students belonged to such organizations ; today fraternity members represent between 2 and 3 percent of the total student population .
the traditional practice of intentionally wounding each other in the face with swords while fencing may also have contributed to students ' loss of interest . yet those who do join are not all right-wing extremists , as the stereotype may suggest .
rudi , a 22-year-old student of english and sports , admitted that he had simply " landed in the fraternity by accident " after finding a room there on the internet . cosmopolita n i n n ature ? bernd , another nibelungen resident , painted a rather cosmopolitan picture of the organization -lrb- cocktails aside -rrb- . " just because we 're in a fraternity does n't mean we 're different from everybody else , " he said .
" we have parties here like everyone else too .
and they 're really fun because lots of people come together , different nationalities are there , which makes for a good international mix and that can only mean fun . " the nibelugen house , located near the university in cologne , is international indeed : only two of its six residents are german . vladimir müller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

the european union wants other country 's talent to come here but the eu 's requirements for them to study and research in europe resemble an obstacle course . the european union is in intense competition with others , particularly the united states , for young , bright academics .
students from developing countries are wanted to help increase the quality and reputation of european universities and research institutes . but what education experts in the eu demand varies radically from what brussels ' bureaucratic measures require of fellowship or exchange program applicants .
sometimes , the obstacles are so great that some college students give up out of sheer frustration . health i n sura n ce , apartme n t a n d large sums of mo n ey required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scientific research needs minds from around the globe valentina dimitrovska , a 27-year old biologist from skopje , macedonia , knows the procedure first-hand . an italian research institute had invited her for a two-year stay .
the only thing missing was a visa from the italian government .
the appointment at the embassy in skopje , which she had to wait two weeks for , would make determine her fate for the next two years .
for the moment , she wore the best clothing she had : dark slacks , white blouse , and a blazer .
the room for error should be minimalized as much as possible . " you have to have all your papers - there are some 40 - to prove to the embassy that you do n't want to spend the rest of your life in italym , " she said .
" you have to prove to the embassy staff that you are coming back to macedonia .
at the moment i am unemployed , so it was difficult to convince them that i was honest . " to underscore her veracity , she read from an embassy brochure what she needed : a permanent residence in macedonia , the parents have to be wage-earners , health insurance , and last but not least , a large sum of money in a bank account . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all macedonians want to leave their capital , skopje , permanently for young scholars at the start of their careers , the last point is frequently next to impossible to fulfill : dimitrovska , like many young macedonians , still lives at home with her sister and parents . " then they wanted me to prove that my mother works and has money , " she said .
" my father is already retired , so i had to show his last three pay slips . " eu wa n ts to have its cake a n d to eat it too lawmakers in brussels , such as ewa klamt , a member of the conservative european people 's party in the european parliament and expert for immigration issues , realize that the bar is set much too high for most academics coming from developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament seeks students but has high demands " exactly very intelligent people , people who are ready to break out into the world , people with knowledge , finally reach the conclusion : ' i do n't have to wait an eternity for a visa for the european union .
i can go to the us or canada .
i 'm wanted there , i can do my research , i can work , " ' she said . yet her beliefs of making the eu easier to enter for students and researchers are not shared by the majority .
klamt does n't understand that lawmakers would claim that europe is not a continent of immigrants , or that germany is not a country of immigrants . " in reality , there is constant movement , " she said .
" people are coming to us and people are leaving . " visa i n the pocket dimitrovska passed the rigorous test at the italian embassy and was granted her visa .
but the whole experience has left a bad taste in her mouth . " i feel like i 've been discriminated , " she said .
" our country 's reputation may be bad but here -lrb- at the embassy -rrb- my dignity was pushed to the limit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold vintners toast german wine 's popularity german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations europe -pipe- 04.06.2006 eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winemakers will be asked to change the way they operate vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina . the reform plans are being finalized by eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel , who wants to encourage producers to abandon some of the vineyards and put the focus on better quality wines , thereby putting supply more in line with demand . " i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

we 've worked hard for three years and now we 're getting to the big event , and you feel the tension a bit .
but we 're looking forward to it . you 're n ot o n ly preside n t of the germa n soccer associatio n you 're also vice preside n t of the orga n izi n g committee for the fifa world cup 2006 .
is there a n ythi n g i n this that could shake your co n fide n ce ?
i do n't think anything will shake my confidence .
of course we know there are still some areas that need our attention .
one of those - which will probably go right up until the last day - is the whole business of ticketing .
it 's very complex , but it has to be complex because we want to offer security and that 's why there was a joint decision by fifa , the german government and the organizing committee that tickets would be personalized .
and in practice that is very , very difficult .
orga n izi n g a huge eve n t like this is quite a feat eve n for a cou n try like germa n y .
how well have we do n e our homework ?
you can only master such a challenge through good co-operation .
we 've experienced this co-operation from the german government right from the day in 2000 that the decision was announced that germany would host the world cup .
we 've seen co-operation from the state governments , that 's very important in our federal republic .
we 've been able to work very closely with the 12 cities hosting world cup matches , in particular .
there 's been truly excellent co-operation there .
what do you say to the fears that the stadiums could be half-empty at some games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to make friends - and to keep those friends safe we 've made an effort to ensure this wo n't happen .
you can take for granted that we will have sold all the tickets by then , but even so there have always been cases where seats were still empty .
that can happen in the hospitality sector .
but it would be very unfortunate for us , if the stands for fans were empty .
and that will be one of our jobs right up till the end - that those people who actually have a ticket go into the stadium and are there .
i hope we succeed - but we ca n't guarantee it . you radiate a sometimes eerie se n se of calm , eve n at times of crisis .
is that somethi n g based o n your backgrou n d or is it a result of your experie n ce as a lawyer , a politicia n , a ma n ager ?
no , you can only stay calm when you 're pretty sure - even being self-critical - that you 've done your homework . and then you keep your cool which basically everyone should have . because we now all know there is no absolute guarantee of security , we ca n't deliver perfection .
it 's just not humanly possible . and people will forgive us a few mistakes and not get upset - and i do n't think it would be so bad for germany 's reputation in the world if people notice : ah ha !
the germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything either . how much of a problem was it for you duri n g the preparatio n s that the ope n i n g gala had to be ca n celled ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller 's extravagent opening gala was scrapped we wanted to present reunited germany as a country committed to freedom and the human dignity - and so for us , alongside the 64 games , cultural events : the concerts , the exhibitions are very , very important .
the opening ceremony would have been a great experience , not only for germans but also for our guests .
but when the sponsorship of the event was transferred from the government to fifa , things were seen differently .
the government viewed it as something for our country .
fifa looked at it with international eyes , and probably also considered the economic risks .
and in the end it was quite so clear and then there was the problem with the pitch , and everything else .
we were disappointed , but we were n't critical because we were n't the organizers of that event . o n the subject of fifa : has this om n ipote n t attitude of fifa helped or hi n dered i n the preparatio n s ?
it is a highly delicate form of co-operation that must be acknowledged .
fifa is an international organization - it 's their world cup .
that 's something we maybe somewhat underestimated at the start .
we thought it was a german world cup .
and it 's not , we had to learn that .
on the other hand , and i 'm very grateful that the president of fifa has also said this , we have been made aware that the commercial aspects of the world cup , in particular the legal aspects , do take precedence .
with fifa , you do have to wonder whether they should be doing this with people in the long term - and it is in fact all the little people who make football strong .
the agreements fifa makes , particularly in the marketing area - about what you can and ca n't do , what you 're allowed to eat and drink , what you may do in what place - they were demanding for us and there have been disputes and confusion in many areas .
and i think , and my understanding of what the president thinks , is that fifa will also consider whether this is wise in the long-term . jürge n kli n sma n n , oliver bierhoff , matthias sammer - is that a dream trio for the future of germa n soccer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and oli were happy before sammi came along that would be my wish - although when it comes down to the german coach , you never know what could happen .
that 's also the reason why we could join forces with two top football personalities - tried and true national players - who promise continuity .
oliver bierhoff - who 's responsible for the management of the national a team and the under 21s ; matthias sammer - who 's head of the national youth team , head of coaching and responsible for the fostering of young players .
they fit well together .
and now , my wish is that jürgen klinsmann is not only successful , but that - in the wake of success - he says , it 's fun working with the young players and i 'll stay on another two years .
a n d fi n ally - who 'll be playi n g i n the fi n al i n berli n o n july 9th ?
of course my hope as always is that it will be brazil against germany .
actually all german soccer fans want this , because that 's the earliest that we could meet brazil - in the final .
that 's the way the schedule 's set up . thomas mandlmeier interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer gets new director in controversial decision in a defeat decision for german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , former german international matthias sammer was named technical director of the national team by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- wednesday .

prime minister jiri paroubek 's social democrats , seeking a third term in office , came in second with 32.3 percent , according to official results released by the czech statistical office . although the civic democrats came out on top , they face a difficult challenge in putting together a government as right and left wing forces each won 100 seats in the 200-member lower house of parliament . that task appeared to become even harder after his main election opponent , social democrat prime minister jiri paroubek , said he would propose taking his party into opposition after eight years in power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- campaigned with paroubek -lrb- right -rrb- " i will support our move into the opposition , " he said . such a move would rule out the creation of a german-style grand coalition between the two main parties , regarded as one way out of the the post-election deadlock .
topolanek accused paroubek of " having an interest in a new election by questioning the last one . " the official results showed that the civic democrats won 81 seats and their christian democrat allies 13 .
with the probable support of six green deputies the right could muster only 100 votes .
the social democrats won 74 seats and the communists 26 .
the greens have said they will not join any coalition with the communists . mulli n g the optio n s communist leaders have already suggested forming a government of national unity , but such a step is unlikely as all other parties have ruled out coalitions with the communists . " it is a complete deadlock , " political analyst jiri pehe told afp news service , adding that a german-style grand coalition between topolanek 's civic democrats and prime minister jiri paroubek 's left-wing social democrats might be the only solution - something both parties have said they would not do . " the election campaign was extremely nasty .
politicians have dug trenches between themselves that are so deep it will be difficult to cross them now , " pehe said , adding topolanek and paroubek might have to step aside to make a coalition possible .
he also said that the alternative was to hold new elections . preside n t favors co n servatives without waiting for the count to be completed and the final allocation of seats to be announced , president vaclav klaus on saturday said he would invite the civic democrats to launch negotiations over the formation of a government on monday . the head of the largest party in parliament is usually given the first chance to try and form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exit polls : czech conservatives win elections the right-wing civic democratic party of mirek topolanek was predicted to win legislative elections in the czech republic on saturday with 38 percent of the vote , according to a first forecast .

the european union wants other country 's talent to come here but the eu 's requirements for them to study and research in europe resemble an obstacle course . the european union is in intense competition with others , particularly the united states , for young , bright academics .
students from developing countries are wanted to help increase the quality and reputation of european universities and research institutes . but what education experts in the eu demand varies radically from what brussels ' bureaucratic measures require of fellowship or exchange program applicants .
sometimes , the obstacles are so great that some college students give up out of sheer frustration . health i n sura n ce , apartme n t a n d large sums of mo n ey required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scientific research needs minds from around the globe valentina dimitrovska , a 27-year old biologist from skopje , macedonia , knows the procedure first-hand . an italian research institute had invited her for a two-year stay .
the only thing missing was a visa from the italian government .
the appointment at the embassy in skopje , which she had to wait two weeks for , would make determine her fate for the next two years .
for the moment , she wore the best clothing she had : dark slacks , white blouse , and a blazer .
the room for error should be minimalized as much as possible . " you have to have all your papers - there are some 40 - to prove to the embassy that you do n't want to spend the rest of your life in italym , " she said .
" you have to prove to the embassy staff that you are coming back to macedonia .
at the moment i am unemployed , so it was difficult to convince them that i was honest . " to underscore her veracity , she read from an embassy brochure what she needed : a permanent residence in macedonia , the parents have to be wage-earners , health insurance , and last but not least , a large sum of money in a bank account . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all macedonians want to leave their capital , skopje , permanently for young scholars at the start of their careers , the last point is frequently next to impossible to fulfill : dimitrovska , like many young macedonians , still lives at home with her sister and parents . " then they wanted me to prove that my mother works and has money , " she said .
" my father is already retired , so i had to show his last three pay slips . " eu wa n ts to have its cake a n d to eat it too lawmakers in brussels , such as ewa klamt , a member of the conservative european people 's party in the european parliament and expert for immigration issues , realize that the bar is set much too high for most academics coming from developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament seeks students but has high demands " exactly very intelligent people , people who are ready to break out into the world , people with knowledge , finally reach the conclusion : ' i do n't have to wait an eternity for a visa for the european union .
i can go to the us or canada .
i 'm wanted there , i can do my research , i can work , " ' she said . yet her beliefs of making the eu easier to enter for students and researchers are not shared by the majority .
klamt does n't understand that lawmakers would claim that europe is not a continent of immigrants , or that germany is not a country of immigrants . " in reality , there is constant movement , " she said .
" people are coming to us and people are leaving . " visa i n the pocket dimitrovska passed the rigorous test at the italian embassy and was granted her visa .
but the whole experience has left a bad taste in her mouth . " i feel like i 've been discriminated , " she said .
" our country 's reputation may be bad but here -lrb- at the embassy -rrb- my dignity was pushed to the limit .
you just lose courage when you see all that they want .
who do they think i am ?
a thief ?
a terrorist ?

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .
a key area that will be targeted will be " grubbing up , " or digging up , vines by offering cash incentives for winemakers to abandon fields they do n't absolutely need to use . the eu spends about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- a year on wine subsidies .
the planned reform , the first since 1999 , would not change that amount .
instead , the plan would redirect subsidies and use a carrot-and-stick approach to convince european producers to rip up some of their vines , which amount for some 45 percent of the world 's vineyard area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe grows too many of these for current demand the plan is due to be published on june 22 .
eu governments and the wine industry will then have an opportunity to discuss the plan 's various options until the autumn , when the european commission will draft a formal reform proposal for publication in december or january . " then we have the first half of 2007 to have an in-depth discussion with the member states , and i hope we can manage to finalize it before summer 2007 , " fischer boel said .
" then we need implementation , so that would be from 2008 . " supply and demand the eu is the world 's largest producer , consumer , exporter and importer of wine .
but for many years , subsidies have thrown the relationship between wine supply and demand off balance , resulting in huge surpluses that could not be sold on the market .
fischer boel has often complained of the money the eu spends on " crisis distillation , " as much as half a billion euros per year -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in the 1990s , eu winemakers began shifting their emphasis to producing higher-quality wine , which closed the gap between supply and demand somewhat , but not as much as brussels would like to see . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vintners will probably be offered cash to dig up some fields " in my view , what we need to do is to spend more money on marketing wine , " luxembourg 's agriculture minister , fernand boden , told reporters .
" we have to use the money that 's now spent on distillation in a more intelligent way , to promote consumption . " although europe is still the major player on the global wine market , it has lost some of its traditional export market in recent years to cheaper wines from countries like australia , chile and the united states .
the eu has also begun to import more . " a reform has to restore european wine production to be competitive with imports that we have seen from the new wine-producing countries , " fischer boel said . but she said she expects resistance from vintners , especially since winemaking has such deep cultural roots in many regions . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

" i want to make a bold reform because just changing minor things would n't improve anything , " fischer boel told reporters at an informal meeting of eu agriculture ministers . at present , the eu produces much more wine then it sells , resulting in huge " lakes " of surplus product that brussels spends millions of euros on to turn into undrinkable , industrial alcohol and biofuels .

the ship was found buried in the banks of the river usk as workers dug the foundations of the city 's new arts centre in august 2002 .
it has since been removed timber by timber , and experts are examining and recording the pieces .
earlier this year a french silver coin was found inside one of the timbers .
on sunday , the doors of the storage unit where the timbers of the ship are being kept in tanks of water will be open to the public , who will be shown the work taking place on the vessel .
the 15th century coin , which experts think was new and intended to be a good luck charm , will be on display .
there are also guided tours on how the 1,700 timbers of the ship are being recorded and analysed using digital technology .
the coin will be on display during the open day the estimated 25 tonnes of waterlogged timbers are each being analysed using technology that will allow the team to rebuild a virtual ship on the computer screen without having to handle the large , heavy and fragile timbers .
the newport ship is the most complete surviving 15th century vessel discovered in recent years .
it was found on the banks of the river during the construction of the riverfront arts centre .
in february , a coin , wrapped in tarred caulking , was discovered in one of the wooden timbers .
the coin has been identified as a petit blanc of the dauphin louis de france , who became louis xi in 1461 .
it was minted in the town of crémieu between 1440 -1456 .
the discovery meant the restoration team , who already knew the ship was abandoned on wooden struts around 1468 , can calculate the ship 's working life and work out it was probably built in france in december the restoration project received a grant of almost £ 800,000 from the heritage lottery fund -lrb- hlf -rrb- .
it will eventually be displayed in the riverfront centre .
the ship is one of the most important finds of recent times toby jones , one of the project officers involved in the restoration , said : " we received substantial heritage lottery funding which has meant we could get more digital devices and were able to triple the team so we are now recording the timbers as fast as we can .
" the appearance of the ship will be largely similar to what people saw last year but we are going to be showing the coin - although it is quite tiny .
" and we have got guided tours so people can learn about all the stages of the work we are doing , " he added .
the open day between 1100 bst and 1600 bst on sunday at the ship centre , unit 22 , maesglas industrial estate , newport , includes a medieval fair and other entertainment .

at the moment , a by-law in devon and cornwall bans fishermen from taking pregnant female lobsters within six miles -lrb- 10km -rrb- of the shore .
the minister was considering extending this to the open sea , thus bringing in a blanket ban , but he 's now decided against doing so .
some fisherman are delighted .
others say he has bowed to pressure from people who put short-term gain above the viability of lobster stocks in the future .
ban extended dartmouth lobster and crab fisherman chris venmore said mr bradshaw had agreed in principle to extend the inshore ban on taking pregnant lobsters - or berried hens , as they are known - outside the six-mile limit to conserve stocks .
now , he says , the minister has done a u-turn .
" you would n't shoot a pheasant sitting on its nest of eggs and a farmer would not kill his sheep when they are lambing , " said mr venmore , who chairs the devon sea fisheries committee .
" it seems ludicrous to me that we should kill a lobster when it is about to produce its young .
" if you put that lobster back , it will get rid of its eggs and you can catch it again in two or three months ' time . "
delicate balance a large berried hen lobster can have up to 100,000 eggs when it breeds every two years .
but only a handful of these eggs will go on to become full-grown lobsters .
dr john spicer , a marine biologist at the university of plymouth , says studies have shown that lobster populations can be extremely fragile .
" it is amazing how little you need to do before you get crashes in the lobster population , " he said .
" so you do not want to take berried females unless you really need to . "
some disagreement but not all fishermen agree .
in some parts of cornwall , berried lobsters can account for half the catch .
they are understandably pleased at defra 's decision " it is a very emotive subject and the general public may think banning berried lobsters is a good thing , " said paul trebilcock , chairman of cornwall fish producers .
" but at the moment the science tells us that it is a very marginal measure and it has a massive economic impact .
we can not really see the benefit of it .
" there are alternative measures which we have suggested - like the increased minimum landing size - and that seems the best way forward at the moment . "
defra standpoint a spokesman for defra makes it clear that , from the ministry 's point of view , it is not just a question of science - but also one of enforcement .
" scientific studies show that a ban on landing berried lobsters and an increase in the minimum landing size , if complied with equally , would provide similar conservation benefits , " he said .
" however , the ban on landing berried lobsters would be more difficult to enforce and is likely to be widely ignored . "
andrew george , liberal democrat mp for st ives and a former fisheries spokesman for his party , said he was determined to take up the issue again with mr bradshaw - and to press for a blanket ban .
defra , meanwhile , says it will keep the situation under review .

they are understandably pleased at defra 's decision " it is a very emotive subject and the general public may think banning berried lobsters is a good thing , " said paul trebilcock , chairman of cornwall fish producers .
" but at the moment the science tells us that it is a very marginal measure and it has a massive economic impact .
we can not really see the benefit of it .
" there are alternative measures which we have suggested - like the increased minimum landing size - and that seems the best way forward at the moment . "
defra standpoint a spokesman for defra makes it clear that , from the ministry 's point of view , it is not just a question of science - but also one of enforcement .
" scientific studies show that a ban on landing berried lobsters and an increase in the minimum landing size , if complied with equally , would provide similar conservation benefits , " he said .
" however , the ban on landing berried lobsters would be more difficult to enforce and is likely to be widely ignored . "
andrew george , liberal democrat mp for st ives and a former fisheries spokesman for his party , said he was determined to take up the issue again with mr bradshaw - and to press for a blanket ban .
defra , meanwhile , says it will keep the situation under review .

supporters of the new oxford biomedical research facility held a rally in favour in central oxford on saturday .

last week , oxford university was granted an extension to its injunction against animal rights activists .
the high court widened an order to protect staff , students and contractors from harassment by some protesters .
construction of the laboratory in south parks road was halted in july 2004 when contractors pulled out after a campaign led by speak .

the heroin was given out in seven clinics in seven cities across the country .
bob wylie has been to hamburg to investigate the results .
the scheme has been trialled in seven german cities see one addict 's view if you go to hamburg these days you ca n't miss the blue goals .
they are a modern art masterpiece for the world cup - 120 fluorescent blue goals on buildings all over the city .
when the battle for the jules rimet cup is in town hamburg will host three matches including a quarter final .
big frank jerke says he ca n't wait .
he 'll be glued to the television and may even try to get a ticket for one of the games .
time was when that would have been unthinkable .
less than three years ago frank was down and out , homeless and hopelessly hooked on heroin .
it was around seven in the morning when i first saw him on hoegerdamm street on the outskirts of hamburg 's city centre .
he 's a big man .
he stumbled off the bus and muttered " morgen " , as he passed me at the top of the steps .
medical supervision downstairs he rang the bell at the hamburg heroin clinic .
inside he took a breath test to prove he had not had any alcohol and then he went next door into what they call the application room .
there , under medical supervision , he was given a syringe with chemically pure heroin - diamorphine - diluted in water .
he got up on one of the beds , dropped his trousers and injected it into his thigh .
dr christian haasen says the results are " significant " see a full interview he put his head back and closed his eyes for a few minutes then got up , left the clinic and went to work in one of hamburg 's ship repair yards - the same as he used to do all those years ago before the smack got him .
" everything is good now .
i 've got a nice flat of my own and a good job .
better , " he says .
he laughed as he left .
these days his teeth are a credit to any toothpaste manufacturer .
frank is one of 500 drug addicts in germany who are on the heroin pilot programme .
it is being conducted in seven major cities across germany .
hamburg is the biggest trial .
results published german doctors looked at the success of heroin on prescription in switzerland and then the netherlands and after years of debate the bundestag accepted that a pilot should be set up .
the project started three years ago and was based on comparing heroin maintenance with methadone maintenance .
five hundred or so users were given heroin - they had to have failed on methadone beforehand - and 500 were given methadone .
the results were published recently .
on almost all counts the heroin group did better than the methadone group .
frank jerke is among those on the programme in hamburg dr christian haasen is the research director of the german trial .
in his office at the university of hamburg he tells me in a matter of fact manner : " the differences between the heroin group and the methadone group are statistically significant .
" those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records . "
he says he knew from other heroin trials in switzerland and the netherlands that there would be differences but that even he was surprised at the improvements sustained by those on heroin .
these positives also affect employment prospects .
at the hamburg clinic 40 of the clients are working out of the 90 going there to get heroin .
stuck on heroin ludovic leblanc , 32 , is a waiter in one of the best italian restaurants in hamburg .
his take home pay , with tips , is 2,400 euros , or £ 1,800 .
he 's got a good flat in the city centre and looks every inch an aspiring head waiter when he 's kitted out for work .
not bad for 15 years on heroin .
ludovic goes to the clinic twice a day - once in the morning before work and during his afternoon break .
his employer knows about it .
but in his kitchen 13 storeys up above the river elbe , i put it to him that , remarkable as his progress has been , he 's still stuck on heroin .
for us to give patients a daily kick on heroin can not be seen as a permanent solution dietrich wersich state health minister heroin prescription ' cuts costs ' ' let gps prescribe heroin ' " no , i hope to be drug free by this time next year , " he asserts .
he 's now on a quarter of the daily dose of heroin he was getting when he started at the clinic two years ago .
" i could n't have dreamed of that on methadone .
after a year and a half on methadone the dose stayed the same and i would go to get street heroin almost every night , " he said .
doctors at the hoegerdamm clinic say one in 10 are on sufficiently decreasing doses to be described as " moving towards abstinence " .
but the preliminary figures for the study do not show any remarkable difference between heroin and methadone in the numbers that finish drug free .
youth protection drug deaths are different .
since 2001 german drug deaths are down by 40 % , according to christian haasen .
a policeman made the same point about hamburg .
ch supt norbert ziebarth is the head of youth protection for hamburg police .
at the rather imposing polizeiprasidium hq in the north of hamburg he tells me that in the time of the heroin clinic drug deaths in hamburg have dropped from 101 in 2001 to 61 last year .
police in hamburg are supportive of the scheme the existence of the clinic , in a way , also allowed a police crackdown on what used to be hamburg 's open drug scene .
there are no shooting galleries in parks or congregations of drug users at the central railway station , on the scale there used to be .
the police support the trial and its extension .
" it works for the worst heroin users .
we support it , " says det supt ziebarth .
not that everyone is of the same view .
the heroin clinic experiment was introduced by the social democrat government of gerhardt schroeder .
now the conservative cdu , led by angela merkel , are in power .
they are altogether less enthusiastic about heroin on the state .
better support i found that out when i met the hamburg state minister of health , dietrich wersich .
he disputes some of the findings of the german study and questions the costs of heroin on prescription - thus far three times greater than methadone .
" the results for the heroin group were only slightly better than those of the methadone group , " he says , " and they may have been due to other factors than solely the prescription of heroin , like better social services support and things like that . "
herr wersich is also dubious about what he describes as the state becoming in effect a licensed narcotics dealer .
ludovic leblanc holds down as job as a restaurant waiter " for us to give patients a daily kick on heroin can not be seen as a permanent solution , " he said .
" instead we have to work to get them drug free and how can you say that 's being done if the government is giving them a kick on heroin every day ... and besides will the taxpayer be prepared to pay for this ? "
this weekend the lancet published a research study of the swiss heroin clinics , which have been running for 10 years .
the study suggests that the swiss model is responsible for reduced heroin use in the long term .
swiss drug deaths have plummeted in the last 10 years .
the lancet editorial points that in the same time the uk has had the highest drug deaths every year of any european country .
the last official figures for drug-related deaths in scotland was 356 for 2004 .
that was almost 50 % higher than the figure a decade ago .
so here 's the question : is it now time for scotland to follow germany and other european countries and introduce heroin clinics to give our worst addicts heroin on prescription ?
bob wylie 's report from hamburg will be broadcast on radio scotland 's investigation programme at 0900 bst on monday .
there will also be a special report on newsnight scotland at 2300 bst .

the heroin was given out in seven clinics in seven cities across the country .
bob wylie has been to hamburg to investigate the results .
the scheme has been trialled in seven german cities see one addict 's view if you go to hamburg these days you ca n't miss the blue goals .
they are a modern art masterpiece for the world cup - 120 fluorescent blue goals on buildings all over the city .
when the battle for the jules rimet cup is in town hamburg will host three matches including a quarter final .
big frank jerke says he ca n't wait .
he 'll be glued to the television and may even try to get a ticket for one of the games .
time was when that would have been unthinkable .
less than three years ago frank was down and out , homeless and hopelessly hooked on heroin .
it was around seven in the morning when i first saw him on hoegerdamm street on the outskirts of hamburg 's city centre .
he 's a big man .
he stumbled off the bus and muttered " morgen " , as he passed me at the top of the steps .
medical supervision downstairs he rang the bell at the hamburg heroin clinic .
inside he took a breath test to prove he had not had any alcohol and then he went next door into what they call the application room .
there , under medical supervision , he was given a syringe with chemically pure heroin - diamorphine - diluted in water .
he got up on one of the beds , dropped his trousers and injected it into his thigh .
dr christian haasen says the results are " significant " see a full interview he put his head back and closed his eyes for a few minutes then got up , left the clinic and went to work in one of hamburg 's ship repair yards - the same as he used to do all those years ago before the smack got him .
" everything is good now .
i 've got a nice flat of my own and a good job .
better , " he says .
he laughed as he left .
these days his teeth are a credit to any toothpaste manufacturer .
frank is one of 500 drug addicts in germany who are on the heroin pilot programme .
it is being conducted in seven major cities across germany .
hamburg is the biggest trial .
results published german doctors looked at the success of heroin on prescription in switzerland and then the netherlands and after years of debate the bundestag accepted that a pilot should be set up .
the project started three years ago and was based on comparing heroin maintenance with methadone maintenance .
five hundred or so users were given heroin - they had to have failed on methadone beforehand - and 500 were given methadone .
the results were published recently .
on almost all counts the heroin group did better than the methadone group .
frank jerke is among those on the programme in hamburg dr christian haasen is the research director of the german trial .
in his office at the university of hamburg he tells me in a matter of fact manner : " the differences between the heroin group and the methadone group are statistically significant .
" those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records . "
he says he knew from other heroin trials in switzerland and the netherlands that there would be differences but that even he was surprised at the improvements sustained by those on heroin .
these positives also affect employment prospects .
at the hamburg clinic 40 of the clients are working out of the 90 going there to get heroin .
stuck on heroin ludovic leblanc , 32 , is a waiter in one of the best italian restaurants in hamburg .
his take home pay , with tips , is 2,400 euros , or £ 1,800 .
he 's got a good flat in the city centre and looks every inch an aspiring head waiter when he 's kitted out for work .
not bad for 15 years on heroin .
ludovic goes to the clinic twice a day - once in the morning before work and during his afternoon break .
his employer knows about it .
but in his kitchen 13 storeys up above the river elbe , i put it to him that , remarkable as his progress has been , he 's still stuck on heroin .
for us to give patients a daily kick on heroin can not be seen as a permanent solution dietrich wersich state health minister heroin prescription ' cuts costs ' ' let gps prescribe heroin ' " no , i hope to be drug free by this time next year , " he asserts .
he 's now on a quarter of the daily dose of heroin he was getting when he started at the clinic two years ago .
" i could n't have dreamed of that on methadone .
after a year and a half on methadone the dose stayed the same and i would go to get street heroin almost every night , " he said .
doctors at the hoegerdamm clinic say one in 10 are on sufficiently decreasing doses to be described as " moving towards abstinence " .
but the preliminary figures for the study do not show any remarkable difference between heroin and methadone in the numbers that finish drug free .
youth protection drug deaths are different .
since 2001 german drug deaths are down by 40 % , according to christian haasen .
a policeman made the same point about hamburg .
ch supt norbert ziebarth is the head of youth protection for hamburg police .
at the rather imposing polizeiprasidium hq in the north of hamburg he tells me that in the time of the heroin clinic drug deaths in hamburg have dropped from 101 in 2001 to 61 last year .
police in hamburg are supportive of the scheme the existence of the clinic , in a way , also allowed a police crackdown on what used to be hamburg 's open drug scene .
there are no shooting galleries in parks or congregations of drug users at the central railway station , on the scale there used to be .
the police support the trial and its extension .
" it works for the worst heroin users .
we support it , " says det supt ziebarth .
not that everyone is of the same view .
the heroin clinic experiment was introduced by the social democrat government of gerhardt schroeder .
now the conservative cdu , led by angela merkel , are in power .
they are altogether less enthusiastic about heroin on the state .
better support i found that out when i met the hamburg state minister of health , dietrich wersich .
he disputes some of the findings of the german study and questions the costs of heroin on prescription - thus far three times greater than methadone .
" the results for the heroin group were only slightly better than those of the methadone group , " he says , " and they may have been due to other factors than solely the prescription of heroin , like better social services support and things like that . "
herr wersich is also dubious about what he describes as the state becoming in effect a licensed narcotics dealer .
ludovic leblanc holds down as job as a restaurant waiter " for us to give patients a daily kick on heroin can not be seen as a permanent solution , " he said .
" instead we have to work to get them drug free and how can you say that 's being done if the government is giving them a kick on heroin every day ... and besides will the taxpayer be prepared to pay for this ? "
this weekend the lancet published a research study of the swiss heroin clinics , which have been running for 10 years .
the study suggests that the swiss model is responsible for reduced heroin use in the long term .
swiss drug deaths have plummeted in the last 10 years .
the lancet editorial points that in the same time the uk has had the highest drug deaths every year of any european country .
the last official figures for drug-related deaths in scotland was 356 for 2004 .
that was almost 50 % higher than the figure a decade ago .
so here 's the question : is it now time for scotland to follow germany and other european countries and introduce heroin clinics to give our worst addicts heroin on prescription ?
bob wylie 's report from hamburg will be broadcast on radio scotland 's investigation programme at 0900 bst on monday .
there will also be a special report on newsnight scotland at 2300 bst .

he says he knew from other heroin trials in switzerland and the netherlands that there would be differences but that even he was surprised at the improvements sustained by those on heroin .
these positives also affect employment prospects .
at the hamburg clinic 40 of the clients are working out of the 90 going there to get heroin .
stuck on heroin ludovic leblanc , 32 , is a waiter in one of the best italian restaurants in hamburg .
his take home pay , with tips , is 2,400 euros , or £ 1,800 .
he 's got a good flat in the city centre and looks every inch an aspiring head waiter when he 's kitted out for work .
not bad for 15 years on heroin .
ludovic goes to the clinic twice a day - once in the morning before work and during his afternoon break .
his employer knows about it .
but in his kitchen 13 storeys up above the river elbe , i put it to him that , remarkable as his progress has been , he 's still stuck on heroin .
for us to give patients a daily kick on heroin can not be seen as a permanent solution dietrich wersich state health minister heroin prescription ' cuts costs ' ' let gps prescribe heroin ' " no , i hope to be drug free by this time next year , " he asserts .
he 's now on a quarter of the daily dose of heroin he was getting when he started at the clinic two years ago .
" i could n't have dreamed of that on methadone .
after a year and a half on methadone the dose stayed the same and i would go to get street heroin almost every night , " he said .
doctors at the hoegerdamm clinic say one in 10 are on sufficiently decreasing doses to be described as " moving towards abstinence " .
but the preliminary figures for the study do not show any remarkable difference between heroin and methadone in the numbers that finish drug free .
youth protection drug deaths are different .
since 2001 german drug deaths are down by 40 % , according to christian haasen .
a policeman made the same point about hamburg .
ch supt norbert ziebarth is the head of youth protection for hamburg police .
at the rather imposing polizeiprasidium hq in the north of hamburg he tells me that in the time of the heroin clinic drug deaths in hamburg have dropped from 101 in 2001 to 61 last year .
police in hamburg are supportive of the scheme the existence of the clinic , in a way , also allowed a police crackdown on what used to be hamburg 's open drug scene .
there are no shooting galleries in parks or congregations of drug users at the central railway station , on the scale there used to be .
the police support the trial and its extension .
" it works for the worst heroin users .
we support it , " says det supt ziebarth .
not that everyone is of the same view .
the heroin clinic experiment was introduced by the social democrat government of gerhardt schroeder .
now the conservative cdu , led by angela merkel , are in power .
they are altogether less enthusiastic about heroin on the state .
better support i found that out when i met the hamburg state minister of health , dietrich wersich .
he disputes some of the findings of the german study and questions the costs of heroin on prescription - thus far three times greater than methadone .
" the results for the heroin group were only slightly better than those of the methadone group , " he says , " and they may have been due to other factors than solely the prescription of heroin , like better social services support and things like that . "
herr wersich is also dubious about what he describes as the state becoming in effect a licensed narcotics dealer .
ludovic leblanc holds down as job as a restaurant waiter " for us to give patients a daily kick on heroin can not be seen as a permanent solution , " he said .
" instead we have to work to get them drug free and how can you say that 's being done if the government is giving them a kick on heroin every day ... and besides will the taxpayer be prepared to pay for this ? "
this weekend the lancet published a research study of the swiss heroin clinics , which have been running for 10 years .
the study suggests that the swiss model is responsible for reduced heroin use in the long term .
swiss drug deaths have plummeted in the last 10 years .
the lancet editorial points that in the same time the uk has had the highest drug deaths every year of any european country .
the last official figures for drug-related deaths in scotland was 356 for 2004 .
that was almost 50 % higher than the figure a decade ago .
so here 's the question : is it now time for scotland to follow germany and other european countries and introduce heroin clinics to give our worst addicts heroin on prescription ?
bob wylie 's report from hamburg will be broadcast on radio scotland 's investigation programme at 0900 bst on monday .
there will also be a special report on newsnight scotland at 2300 bst .

paul bennett , 47 , chose to die from lethal injection because he could no longer endure his suffering from motor neurone disease , said his father , roy .
mr bennett , from swansea , was at his son 's bedside when he pressed a button to release the fatal prescription .
he said : " the heroism he showed that day gave us a lot of comfort - it was his decision and his alone . "
paul bennett 's death at the dignitas clinic in zurich is being investigated by south wales police , as helping someone to commit suicide is a crime under british law .
speaking on bbc radio five live , roy bennett , from morriston , said all the arrangements for the trip were made by his son , even though he was all but paralysed except for use of his right foot . "
the pain disappeared from his face - the fear disappeared from his eyes - he was now at complete rest " roy bennett , describing his son 's death he said his son had been an active and talented sportsman , dubbed " paul the ball " , until his was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 42 .
doctors had given him a life expectancy of five years but he had found the last 18 months of his intolerable , as he was in constant pain and had been terrified of choking to death as he was unable to swallow , said mr bennett .
a stem cell treatment in vancouver , canada , had failed to provide relief from his symptoms , he said .
" more than a year ago he said to his mother and me , ' i 've had enough - i want to close my eyes and not wake up .
" it was his decision and his alone .
we had watched him suffer , and i do mean suffer .
he said to me ' dad , i am not afraid of dying , i am afraid of living ' . "
mr bennett said his son , who leaves a wife and a 10-year-old son , contacted the clinic himself and made the arrangements to fly out , accompanied by his close family in a private jet .
he said a surgeon who examined his son as part of the dignitas procedure said he would have met mr bennett at the taxi if he had known how ill mr bennett was , rather than asking him to turn up at the surgery .
roy bennett explained how at the dignitas clinic in zurich staff rigged up a machine which delivered an injection after his son pressed a button which had been placed on the floor by his right foot .
at every point , he said his son was told he could change his mind at any time and leave .
palliative care but , he added : " the pain that he was enduring overpowered any hope of him changing his mind . "
after a trial injection with a harmless substance showed that the machine worked , he said his son asked for a final five minutes with loved ones .
he said : " it was the quickest five minutes i have every experienced . "
he said his son then pressed the button and then asked to be laid down .
" he went very , very peacefully .
no more pain .
no more suffering .
the pain disappeared from his face .
the fear disappeared from his eyes .
he was now at complete rest .
" we do n't know how he got through it but it was done with such dignity .
we would try to comfort him .
we would make small talk , what was going through his mind we will never know .
" i 'd give anything to have him back with us now , but not in the state he was in .
it 's a release to him and us that he is no longer in pain and suffering . "
mr bennett has called for a change in the law to allow people in his son 's position to have an assisted death in the uk .
but dr david oliver , a consultant in palliative care at a hospice in kent , told the five live programme that the majority of people with motor neurone disease are able to die a peaceful death if they have good palliative care .
he said : " there are many things we can do to help with pain and the problems with saliva and with choking .
" i see many patients with motor neurone disease and we can help those symptoms and help people get on and do the things they want to . "

brachytherapy has been available for two years but health commission wales -lrb- hcw -rrb- withdrew funding recently .
campaigners say it is another example of a healthcare postcode lottery .
the hcw said a review has been completed and a proposal to commission a low dose of the treatment will be discussed this week .
dave powell , from barry in the vale of glamorgan , was diagnosed with prostate cancer in january this year .
he said his consultant had recommended him for brachytherapy but health officials were refusing to pay for it .
mr powell said : " on 14 march , i was put forward for this treatment and then i was told on the 12 april that they would n't fund it . "
brachytherapy is becoming recognised as an alternative to both radical surgery and standard radiotherapy for prostate cancer treatment .
it involves radioactive seeds being implanted directly into the prostate gland .
the prostate cancer charity said its advantage was its " sheer convenience " , with far shorter stays in hospital .
' completed its review ' john neate , the charity 's chief executive said the treatment had grown in england and scotland over the last year , with the number of centres doubling to 24 .
it was well established in the us , with 40 to 50 % of prostate cancer treatment involving brachytherapy .
he believes that figure is england and scotland is around five per cent .
mr neate said of the hcw decision : " we can only assume there 's some nervousness about this and in some way it 's still regarded as an experimental treatment and novel .
" i think it 's perfectly reasonable that hcw should conduct a review but it should not have stopped access while it was carrying out this review . "
a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said : " health commission wales has completed its review of commissioning arrangements for low-dose brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer .
" a draft policy and a covering paper proposing an option for the commissioning of low-dose brachytherapy in 2006/7 will be discussed at the national commissioning advisory board meeting on 7 june . "
mr powell , who said he had been told he could appeal as a special case , added : " anyone diagnosed with prostate cancer is a special case as far as i 'm concerned .
" i 'm not prepared to compromise on my treatment because it 's more convenient for them . "

paul bennett , 47 , chose to die from lethal injection because he could no longer endure his suffering from motor neurone disease , said his father , roy .
mr bennett , from swansea , was at his son 's bedside when he pressed a button to release the fatal prescription .
he said : " the heroism he showed that day gave us a lot of comfort - it was his decision and his alone . "
paul bennett 's death at the dignitas clinic in zurich is being investigated by south wales police , as helping someone to commit suicide is a crime under british law .
speaking on bbc radio five live , roy bennett , from morriston , said all the arrangements for the trip were made by his son , even though he was all but paralysed except for use of his right foot .
the pain disappeared from his face - the fear disappeared from his eyes - he was now at complete rest roy bennett , describing his son 's death he said his son had been an active and talented sportsman , dubbed " paul the ball " , until his was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 42 .
doctors had given him a life expectancy of five years but he had found the last 18 months of his intolerable , as he was in constant pain and had been terrified of choking to death as he was unable to swallow , said mr bennett .
a stem cell treatment in vancouver , canada , had failed to provide relief from his symptoms , he said .
" more than a year ago he said to his mother and me , ' i 've had enough - i want to close my eyes and not wake up .
paul bennett pressed a button to release a lethal injection " it was his decision and his alone .
we had watched him suffer , and i do mean suffer .
he said to me ' dad , i am not afraid of dying , i am afraid of living ' . "
mr bennett said his son , who leaves a wife and a 10-year-old son , contacted the clinic himself and made the arrangements to fly out , accompanied by his close family in a private jet .
he said a surgeon who examined his son as part of the dignitas procedure said he would have met mr bennett at the taxi if he had known how ill mr bennett was , rather than asking him to turn up at the surgery .
roy bennett explained how at the dignitas clinic in zurich staff rigged up a machine which delivered an injection after his son pressed a button which had been placed on the floor by his right foot .
at every point , he said his son was told he could change his mind at any time and leave .
palliative care but , he added : " the pain that he was enduring overpowered any hope of him changing his mind . "
after a trial injection with a harmless substance showed that the machine worked , he said his son asked for a final five minutes with loved ones .
he said : " it was the quickest five minutes i have every experienced . "
he said his son then pressed the button and then asked to be laid down .
" he went very , very peacefully .
no more pain .
no more suffering .
the pain disappeared from his face .
the fear disappeared from his eyes .
he was now at complete rest .
" we do n't know how he got through it but it was done with such dignity .
we would try to comfort him .
we would make small talk , what was going through his mind we will never know .
" i 'd give anything to have him back with us now , but not in the state he was in .
it 's a release to him and us that he is no longer in pain and suffering . "
mr bennett has called for a change in the law to allow people in his son 's position to have an assisted death in the uk .
but dr david oliver , a consultant in palliative care at a hospice in kent , told the five live programme that the majority of people with motor neurone disease are able to die a peaceful death if they have good palliative care .
he said : " there are many things we can do to help with pain and the problems with saliva and with choking .
" i see many patients with motor neurone disease and we can help those symptoms and help people get on and do the things they want to . "

we want an apology from the police and from the justice ministry and we want our servers back tobias andersson , pirate bay spokesman but critics in the entertainment industry argue it is a major source of music and film piracy .
the pirate bay says it does nothing wrong .
its operators maintain that the site 's function is to direct users towards the files that they search for and manage the uploads and downloads .
the website itself does not hold any copyright files .
sweden last year passed legislation banning the sharing of copyrighted material on the internet without royalty payment .
file sharing now carries a maximum two-year jail term .
from the dot.life blog it 's been a game of cat and mouse darren waters , technology editor bbc news website read darren 's thoughts in full about 50 swedish police were involved in 10 raids last wednesday .
three people , including mr neij , were arrested and later released .
they could still face charges .
the pirate bay became a dominant player in tracking bittorrent files when another search index , suprnova.org , closed in late 2004 .
suprnova.org shut down after a relentless campaign by the entertainment industry to close its operations .

gardner , who survived an attack by al-qaeda in saudi arabia almost exactly two years ago , was talking about his new book at the hay festival .
he said he initially had mixed feelings about the us-uk occupation of iraq .
but " the failure to plan for day two has completely let down the iraqi people , " he said .
although he said there were signs for optimism under the new government in iraq , the coalition had made a number of mistakes , including " sending in the z team " .
in an honest account of his own horrific experience at the hands of al-qaeda , which left him partly paralysed , gardner said nothing had turned him against the middle east and its people .
nearly every bit of news that comes out of middle east in bad news but most of the middle east is a happy and largely peaceful place frank gardner he described the " totally opportunistic " shooting , which killed his cameraman simon cumbers and left him critically injured on 6 june 2004 .
two al-qaeda hit teams pulled up by chance , while he was reporting in a riyadh suburb .
he was shot in the shoulder and leg and , when the second team turned up , after a brief discussion in arabic , they pumped four more bullets into his body .
being shot , he said , was like " a giant hand was picking you up and throwing you back with tremendous force " .
he also described the deafening roar of the pistol and the contrasting tinkling sound of spent cartridges as they fell onto the ground .
two years on , gardner has recovered enough to take family skiing holidays with his wife and two young daughters .
after an army training course for disabled skiiers , gardner said he was able to tackle slopes in an adapted bob-ski .
gardner said skiing with his family was " a fantastic moment " he told the packed hay audience : " yes , the gardners are back on the slopes .
it was just a fantastic moment ! "
he said his life had turned around opportunities .
a chance meeting with the arabian explorer sir wilfred thesiger in his youth , led to a life of fascination with the arab world and a degree in the language .
then after a career in banking in bahrain ended with a promotion he did not like , he took the plunge into journalism .
he said five of the al-qaeda cell which shot him were now dead , while the sixth was in jail facing trial and would probably be executed .
affinity gardner , whose account of his experiences is called blood and sand , praised the " first class investigation " by the saudi authorities into the shooting .
he is " cautiously optimistic " about the long term future of iraq but criticised failures of policy following the toppling of saddam hussein .
he said it had led to a power vacuum with the result that iraq was teetering on the brink of civil war .
despite his near-death experience , his affinity for the middle east remained unaffected .
he said : " nearly every bit of news that comes out of middle east in bad news but most of the middle east is a happy and largely peaceful place " .

in an honest account of his own horrific experience at the hands of al-qaeda , which left him partly paralysed , gardner said nothing had turned him against the middle east and its people .
nearly every bit of news that comes out of middle east in bad news but most of the middle east is a happy and largely peaceful place frank gardner he described the " totally opportunistic " shooting , which killed his cameraman simon cumbers and left him critically injured on 6 june 2004 .
two al-qaeda hit teams pulled up by chance , while he was reporting in a riyadh suburb .
he was shot in the shoulder and leg and , when the second team turned up , after a brief discussion in arabic , they pumped four more bullets into his body .
being shot , he said , was like " a giant hand was picking you up and throwing you back with tremendous force " .
he also described the deafening roar of the pistol and the contrasting tinkling sound of spent cartridges as they fell onto the ground .
two years on , gardner has recovered enough to take family skiing holidays with his wife and two young daughters .
after an army training course for disabled skiiers , gardner said he was able to tackle slopes in an adapted bob-ski .
gardner said skiing with his family was " a fantastic moment " he told the packed hay audience : " yes , the gardners are back on the slopes .
it was just a fantastic moment ! "
he said his life had turned around opportunities .
a chance meeting with the arabian explorer sir wilfred thesiger in his youth , led to a life of fascination with the arab world and a degree in the language .
then after a career in banking in bahrain ended with a promotion he did not like , he took the plunge into journalism .
he said five of the al-qaeda cell which shot him were now dead , while the sixth was in jail facing trial and would probably be executed .
affinity gardner , whose account of his experiences is called blood and sand , praised the " first class investigation " by the saudi authorities into the shooting .
he is " cautiously optimistic " about the long term future of iraq but criticised failures of policy following the toppling of saddam hussein .
he said it had led to a power vacuum with the result that iraq was teetering on the brink of civil war .
despite his near-death experience , his affinity for the middle east remained unaffected .
he said : " nearly every bit of news that comes out of middle east in bad news but most of the middle east is a happy and largely peaceful place " .
