but politicians maintained a parliamentary inquiry will still go ahead . the row surrounding alleged german secret service involvement in the opening salvos of the iraq war continued apace wednesday despite assurances by the head of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- that bnd operatives did not help the united states pick out bombing targets during the invasion of iraq . bnd chief ernst uhrlau assured the parliament 's foreign affairs committee that his agents only provided information to the united states on civilian sites to avoid in bombing raids during the opening air strike phase of the war . uhrlau 's statement goes against recent media reports that the actions of the bnd agents in baghdad were more complicated than that and that they acted as scouts for a raid aimed at taking out iraqi leader saddam hussein before the planned invasion .
the claims have caused uproar because germany strongly opposed the 2003 us-led invasion . the committee was engaged in talks late wednesday evening with the two agents at the center of the allegations and its representatives appeared six hours later to state that they accepted their denials of involvement in the raid on a restaurant on april 7 , 2003 , which failed to kill saddam and his inner circle but killed a number of civilians .
the agents also maintained that , prior to their deployment into the iraqi capital , they had had no direct contact with us forces . " the officials have credibly shown that they were not involved in any way in the preparation , planning or execution " of the bombing raid , committee chairman norbert röttgen told reporters . the bnd statements did little , however , to slow the wheels of motion moving the affair into the realm of a parliamentary inquiry . de n ials fail to slow the parliame n tary wheels of motio n politicians from the german opposition parties - the greens , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - continued to push for an extensive investigation into whether then chancellor gerhard schröder 's government played both sides of the war , appeasing public opinion and garnering popularity by opposing military action while covertly supporting it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin said the bnd denials did not end the discussion jürgen trittin , a minister in the schröder government and leading member of the greens , said that the bnd statements did not bring closure to the allegations . " the discussion is not over , " he told reporters .
rainer stinner of the fdp shared his opinion : " we will continue these investigations , " he said . " it 's about clearing up whether the rule of law was breached , how far german authorities may have taken part in that , " stinner continued , " and to what extent there was a contradiction between official statements of the government and actual conduct during the iraq war . " " we must have a complete explanation of what happened during and after the war , " said fdp parliamentary leader wolfgang gerhardt . germa n y complicit through i n volveme n t i n baghdad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say the bnd may have indirectly identified targets norman paech of the left party was among a number of politicians who felt that the role of german agents in identifying ' non-targets ' for bombing , such as hospitals and schools , was still an unacceptable german contribution to the war . " if you specify what ca n't be shot at , that automatically frees up what can be shot at , " paech told reporters . the opposition parties voted for a formal parliamentary investigation into the affair on tuesday and are expected to gain the 25 percent of votes needed in the bundestag debate on friday for the inquiry to begin . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . fischer to oppose the probe as successor feels the heat six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer -lrb- l . -rrb- and frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- were both in schröder 's cabinet at the time fischer understood his party 's desire to learn what key members of the government - including himself - knew but warned the inquiry would be used as a political weapon , the süddeutsche zeitu n g newspaper reported . his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , is under pressure because he was schröder 's chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services at the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 19.01.2006 politics take to the soccer pitch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packed stadiums are often too good a stage for politicians to say no to willing to use any means at their disposal to gain the public 's favor , politicians are more than happy to stage their political battles on the soccer field , but experts wonder if it really has an effect . whether by banning nations from taking part in international sports matches or boycotting events in antagonistic countries , politicians have often used sports as a tool to make political statements and advance their own agendas . the most recent example has come from a number of german politicians who have called for banning iran from the 2006 soccer world cup in response to anti-semitic comments from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad called the holocaust a myth fifa , world soccer 's governing body , announced it would neither ban iran from this summer 's event nor get involved in political issues .
german chancellor angela merkel also stated wednesday that she does not support expelling iran from the tournament . days after the iranian president 's statements , which called for the destruction of israel , germany 's bundesliga leader , bayern munich , played a controversial training match in tehran sparking debate as to whether it legitimized ahmadinejad 's government . no clear line dividing politics and sports bayern 's manager , uli hoeness , told reporters , " we want to reduce this to soccer only . "
however , iran 's vice president and head of sports , mohammad aliabadi , said the game did indeed have " political significance . "
english broadcasts to the 50,000 fans of " peaceful use of nuclear energy is the natural claim of the iranian nation " at the beginning of the match helped demonstrate the iranian approach . but even if bayern were only interested in the 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 363,000 -rrb- they received for the 12-hour trip to tehran , it 's far too late for anyone to ignore the fusion of sports and politics , according to sociology professor gabriele klein , who focuses on movement , sport and dance at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what happens in the game is n't what 's most important when it comes to politics " sports have always been politicized , " she said .
" the actual game on the field during the soccer world cup is only a small part of the entire event . " the political furor that erupted last week over fifa 's cancellation of berlin 's world cup opening gala - an event that would n't have an effect on the tournament 's outcome - also shows there 's more to sports than which team wins . more than just a game " being named host of a large sporting event is of major importance to municipalities as well as national organizers , " klein said .
" whether a city is a venue for world cup matches is important , because sport is much more of a mass phenomenon than other festivals . " the important cultural role sports plays and the emotions it stirs up in fans make it an ideal way for politicians to gain favor among their constituents , according to hans-georg ehrhart of hamburg 's institute for peace research and security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder often tried to connect economic success with victory on the field " politicians try to push themselves into the forefront in an attempt to get some of the shine of the event to rub off on them , " he said .
" you can see it by the number of politicians sitting in the stands . " while politicians in democratic countries have little opportunity to gain any actual standing with voters by kicking a soccer ball or throwing the opening pitch , authoritarian regimes have repeatedly attempted to use international sporting events to legitimize their power , ehrhart added . one of the most infamous examples of the politicization of sports occurred during the 1936 summer olympic games hosted in nazi germany .
hitler used the games as a chance to showcase the third reich and impress the world by improving berlin 's sports facilities and making a show of the until-then modest olympic tradition . the positive side to politics mixing in but it 's not always negative when politicians get involved in sports .
sporting events provide international politicians with a chance to meet without the pressure of international summits and press conferences , according to thomas löwer of philipps university in marburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ping pong " diplomacy helped mao zedong and richard nixon normalize relations in the 1970s " sporting events are always a nice meeting point for politicians , " said löwer , adding that pakistan and india 's politicians meet at international cricket matches and that the 2002 world cup in south korea and japan helped those two nations improve relations as well .
" sports provide a way for countries to get together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2006 opinion : german doctors feel the pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no relief in sight for germany 's frustrated doctors a week of protest by german doctors frustrated by their working conditions culminated in a demonstration that saw thousands take to the streets on wednesday .
they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .
assistant doctors and an increasing number of senior physicians in hospitals feel they 're being exploited . workdays that routinely involve massive amounts of poorly paid or even unpaid overtime are simply unreasonable - not to mention the danger it poses to patient 's lives . hospital directors also feel victimized .
the fact is , clinics are being confronted with enormous cost saving measures .
if they ca n't make it with what little money they have , they face closure .
due to the pressure to save , the hospitals that remain have to make do with fewer beds .
in some cases entire wards are being closed , and each year , the average length of time patients spend in hospital gets shorter . grim future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " reads this protestor 's sign doctors who have their own practices are also suffering from the funding shortage .
the days when opening a practice automatically ensured prosperity for doctors are long over .
today , the threat of bankruptcy hangs over many a private practice .
doctors still enjoy a certain standing in society , but the reality of daily life in hospitals and clinics is humbling , and future prospects are grim . for this reason , more and more newly qualified doctors are leaving germany to work in other european countries , or the united states , where working conditions are much better . doctors feel as if they 're in the grip of a vise - caught between the expectations of their patients and the cost-saving measures dictated to them by the government .
it 's a development that can only lead to the rationing of medical services .
at the same time , the ministry of health makes promises to politicians and the public that doctors are frequently unable to fulfill .
that 's what 's driving our doctors onto the streets . huge challenge however it may seem to outsiders , the reality is that healthcare in germany is not subject to political whim .
rather , the framework for the provision of care has changed dramatically for the worse .
for many years now , employee contributions to health insurance funds have been dropping .
meanwhile , medical advances mean that people are living longer than ever - something that is coupled with enormous costs .
add to this germany 's demographic shift : soon , the number of germans of employment age will decline , relative to the number of senior citizens , which is going up .
health insurance funds with shrinking means will face increasing demand for services . when it comes to healthcare , germany - in addition to many other industrialized nations - faces a huge challenge .
dramatically rising expenditure levels are unavoidable if patients are to receive optimal care .
and that means the cost of health insurance will also rise . the result is predictable - patients will have to bear increasing costs for healthcare in the form of insurance contributions or co-payments for services .
or else , medical treatment will be rationed .
it is the job of politicians to make the situation clear to the public .
doctors are right to protest when government makes promises that ca n't be borne out financially , or else come to bear on those people who work in the healthcare sector . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german doctors protest against pay conditions over 20,000 doctors from hospitals and private practices all over germany took to the streets wednesday to protest against poor salaries and bureaucracy in the statutory health system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2006 opinion : german doctors feel the pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no relief in sight for germany 's frustrated doctors a week of protest by german doctors frustrated by their working conditions culminated in a demonstration that saw thousands take to the streets on wednesday .
they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .
assistant doctors and an increasing number of senior physicians in hospitals feel they 're being exploited . workdays that routinely involve massive amounts of poorly paid or even unpaid overtime are simply unreasonable - not to mention the danger it poses to patient 's lives . hospital directors also feel victimized .
the fact is , clinics are being confronted with enormous cost saving measures .
if they ca n't make it with what little money they have , they face closure .
due to the pressure to save , the hospitals that remain have to make do with fewer beds .
in some cases entire wards are being closed , and each year , the average length of time patients spend in hospital gets shorter . grim future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " reads this protestor 's sign doctors who have their own practices are also suffering from the funding shortage .
the days when opening a practice automatically ensured prosperity for doctors are long over .
today , the threat of bankruptcy hangs over many a private practice .
doctors still enjoy a certain standing in society , but the reality of daily life in hospitals and clinics is humbling , and future prospects are grim . for this reason , more and more newly qualified doctors are leaving germany to work in other european countries , or the united states , where working conditions are much better . doctors feel as if they 're in the grip of a vise - caught between the expectations of their patients and the cost-saving measures dictated to them by the government .
it 's a development that can only lead to the rationing of medical services .
at the same time , the ministry of health makes promises to politicians and the public that doctors are frequently unable to fulfill .
that 's what 's driving our doctors onto the streets . huge challenge however it may seem to outsiders , the reality is that healthcare in germany is not subject to political whim .
rather , the framework for the provision of care has changed dramatically for the worse .
for many years now , employee contributions to health insurance funds have been dropping .
meanwhile , medical advances mean that people are living longer than ever - something that is coupled with enormous costs .
add to this germany 's demographic shift : soon , the number of germans of employment age will decline , relative to the number of senior citizens , which is going up .
health insurance funds with shrinking means will face increasing demand for services . when it comes to healthcare , germany - in addition to many other industrialized nations - faces a huge challenge .
dramatically rising expenditure levels are unavoidable if patients are to receive optimal care .
and that means the cost of health insurance will also rise . the result is predictable - patients will have to bear increasing costs for healthcare in the form of insurance contributions or co-payments for services .
or else , medical treatment will be rationed .
it is the job of politicians to make the situation clear to the public .
doctors are right to protest when government makes promises that ca n't be borne out financially , or else come to bear on those people who work in the healthcare sector . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german doctors protest against pay conditions over 20,000 doctors from hospitals and private practices all over germany took to the streets wednesday to protest against poor salaries and bureaucracy in the statutory health system .

brothers grimm fairytales are the staple of most german children 's upbringing but one grown-up thief will be kicking himself that he did n't remember aspects of the story of hansel and gretel . after making the bizarre choice to steal a karaoke machine from a shop in the western city of bochum , the bungling thief managed to rip open his winter coat in the hurried raid .
as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .

killing whales for research purposes does not make sense because living creatures could be used instead , he said . diplomatic protest at the same time , the action supported environmentalists who have been blocking japanese whale hunters in the antarctic since december .
despite worldwide protest , japan continues to catch whales each year . this week , 17 governments , including britain , protests japan 's scientific whaling program diplomatically . the brazilian ambassador sent tokyo a demarche on behalf of the collective governments , demanding japan " cease all its lethal scientific research on whales .

" whale catching for research , which japan does , adheres to the regulations set forth by the international whaling commission , " embassy secretary kazuya otsuka told reuters news service . at this point , the action is an uncomfortable situation that must be tolerated , he said . " we have no other choice , " otsuka said . berlin 's senator for the interior , ehrhart körting , said he personally was sympathetic toward the protest . " it is our job to allow such congregations , " he said , adding that the police gave a short-term permission for the action , since " it did not endanger the japanese embassy . " cha n ge of strategy ? the berlin protest action might also be the first sign of a shift in strategy by greenpeace officials .
shane rattenbury , who heads an expedition on the greenpeace ship " artic sunrise " that has been trying to interfere with japanese whaling boats , told dw-radio thursday that his group will abort the mission shortly .
last weekend , a harpoon was fired from a japanese whaling ship across a greenpeace boat .

but politicians maintained a parliamentary inquiry will still go ahead . the row surrounding alleged german secret service involvement in the opening salvos of the iraq war continued apace wednesday despite assurances by the head of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- that bnd operatives did not help the united states pick out bombing targets during the invasion of iraq . bnd chief ernst uhrlau assured the parliament 's foreign affairs committee that his agents only provided information to the united states on civilian sites to avoid in bombing raids during the opening air strike phase of the war . uhrlau 's statement goes against recent media reports that the actions of the bnd agents in baghdad were more complicated than that and that they acted as scouts for a raid aimed at taking out iraqi leader saddam hussein before the planned invasion .
the claims have caused uproar because germany strongly opposed the 2003 us-led invasion . the committee was engaged in talks late wednesday evening with the two agents at the center of the allegations and its representatives appeared six hours later to state that they accepted their denials of involvement in the raid on a restaurant on april 7 , 2003 , which failed to kill saddam and his inner circle but killed a number of civilians .

rainer stinner of the fdp shared his opinion : " we will continue these investigations , " he said .

but politicians maintained a parliamentary inquiry will still go ahead . the row surrounding alleged german secret service involvement in the opening salvos of the iraq war continued apace wednesday despite assurances by the head of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- that bnd operatives did not help the united states pick out bombing targets during the invasion of iraq . bnd chief ernst uhrlau assured the parliament 's foreign affairs committee that his agents only provided information to the united states on civilian sites to avoid in bombing raids during the opening air strike phase of the war . uhrlau 's statement goes against recent media reports that the actions of the bnd agents in baghdad were more complicated than that and that they acted as scouts for a raid aimed at taking out iraqi leader saddam hussein before the planned invasion .
the claims have caused uproar because germany strongly opposed the 2003 us-led invasion . the committee was engaged in talks late wednesday evening with the two agents at the center of the allegations and its representatives appeared six hours later to state that they accepted their denials of involvement in the raid on a restaurant on april 7 , 2003 , which failed to kill saddam and his inner circle but killed a number of civilians .
the agents also maintained that , prior to their deployment into the iraqi capital , they had had no direct contact with us forces . " the officials have credibly shown that they were not involved in any way in the preparation , planning or execution " of the bombing raid , committee chairman norbert röttgen told reporters . the bnd statements did little , however , to slow the wheels of motion moving the affair into the realm of a parliamentary inquiry . de n ials fail to slow the parliame n tary wheels of motio n politicians from the german opposition parties - the greens , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - continued to push for an extensive investigation into whether then chancellor gerhard schröder 's government played both sides of the war , appeasing public opinion and garnering popularity by opposing military action while covertly supporting it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin said the bnd denials did not end the discussion jürgen trittin , a minister in the schröder government and leading member of the greens , said that the bnd statements did not bring closure to the allegations . " the discussion is not over , " he told reporters .
rainer stinner of the fdp shared his opinion : " we will continue these investigations , " he said . " it 's about clearing up whether the rule of law was breached , how far german authorities may have taken part in that , " stinner continued , " and to what extent there was a contradiction between official statements of the government and actual conduct during the iraq war . " " we must have a complete explanation of what happened during and after the war , " said fdp parliamentary leader wolfgang gerhardt . germa n y complicit through i n volveme n t i n baghdad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say the bnd may have indirectly identified targets norman paech of the left party was among a number of politicians who felt that the role of german agents in identifying ' non-targets ' for bombing , such as hospitals and schools , was still an unacceptable german contribution to the war . " if you specify what ca n't be shot at , that automatically frees up what can be shot at , " paech told reporters . the opposition parties voted for a formal parliamentary investigation into the affair on tuesday and are expected to gain the 25 percent of votes needed in the bundestag debate on friday for the inquiry to begin . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . fischer to oppose the probe as successor feels the heat six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer -lrb- l . -rrb- and frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- were both in schröder 's cabinet at the time fischer understood his party 's desire to learn what key members of the government - including himself - knew but warned the inquiry would be used as a political weapon , the süddeutsche zeitu n g newspaper reported . his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , is under pressure because he was schröder 's chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services at the time .
he will return from the middle east to vote in the parliamentary debate on friday but some committee members have voiced frustration they had not had time to question steinmeier ahead of the debate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what can a parliamentary inquiry accomplish in the bnd affair ?

as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .
" all they had to do was follow the feathers .

the claims have caused uproar because germany strongly opposed the 2003 us-led invasion . the committee was engaged in talks late wednesday evening with the two agents at the center of the allegations and its representatives appeared six hours later to state that they accepted their denials of involvement in the raid on a restaurant on april 7 , 2003 , which failed to kill saddam and his inner circle but killed a number of civilians .

the stadium at kaiserslautern , where cracks were found in a stand last month , was referred to as " a fire hazard . "
the report caused outrage at the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and the world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- . bergner , however , said stiftung warentest should be thanked for pointing out the problems but added they should not be thought of as grave deficiencies .

brothers grimm fairytales are the staple of most german children 's upbringing but one grown-up thief will be kicking himself that he did n't remember aspects of the story of hansel and gretel . after making the bizarre choice to steal a karaoke machine from a shop in the western city of bochum , the bungling thief managed to rip open his winter coat in the hurried raid .
as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .

requiring at least a year 's prior employment at the company is " disproportionate " to ensure social welfare protection or prevent wage dumping , the court said . it said better legislation on minimum wages for temporary workers could achieve the same goal .
currently , germany does not have a minimum service wage . " the court concludes that germany has infringed the provisions on the freedom to provide services , " a statement by the eu 's highest jurisdiction said . before issuing visas , german diplomatic missions were so far required to make sure that the worker had been employed for at least a year by the company planning to post him or her . berlin tightened its rules after a scandal over lax visa policies under former foreign minister joschka fischer , which critics said permitted a wave of migrants , including criminals , from countries such as ukraine to settle in germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu all but clears germany in visa affair germany 's visa policy of 2000 violated a number of eu laws , the european commission said , but subsequent amendments have been enough to avoid legal action .

brothers grimm fairytales are the staple of most german children 's upbringing but one grown-up thief will be kicking himself that he did n't remember aspects of the story of hansel and gretel . after making the bizarre choice to steal a karaoke machine from a shop in the western city of bochum , the bungling thief managed to rip open his winter coat in the hurried raid .
as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .

english broadcasts to the 50,000 fans of " peaceful use of nuclear energy is the natural claim of the iranian nation " at the beginning of the match helped demonstrate the iranian approach . but even if bayern were only interested in the 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 363,000 -rrb- they received for the 12-hour trip to tehran , it 's far too late for anyone to ignore the fusion of sports and politics , according to sociology professor gabriele klein , who focuses on movement , sport and dance at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what happens in the game is n't what 's most important when it comes to politics " sports have always been politicized , " she said .

" whether a city is a venue for world cup matches is important , because sport is much more of a mass phenomenon than other festivals . " the important cultural role sports plays and the emotions it stirs up in fans make it an ideal way for politicians to gain favor among their constituents , according to hans-georg ehrhart of hamburg 's institute for peace research and security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder often tried to connect economic success with victory on the field " politicians try to push themselves into the forefront in an attempt to get some of the shine of the event to rub off on them , " he said .
" you can see it by the number of politicians sitting in the stands . " while politicians in democratic countries have little opportunity to gain any actual standing with voters by kicking a soccer ball or throwing the opening pitch , authoritarian regimes have repeatedly attempted to use international sporting events to legitimize their power , ehrhart added . one of the most infamous examples of the politicization of sports occurred during the 1936 summer olympic games hosted in nazi germany .
hitler used the games as a chance to showcase the third reich and impress the world by improving berlin 's sports facilities and making a show of the until-then modest olympic tradition . the positive side to politics mixing in but it 's not always negative when politicians get involved in sports .
sporting events provide international politicians with a chance to meet without the pressure of international summits and press conferences , according to thomas löwer of philipps university in marburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ping pong " diplomacy helped mao zedong and richard nixon normalize relations in the 1970s " sporting events are always a nice meeting point for politicians , " said löwer , adding that pakistan and india 's politicians meet at international cricket matches and that the 2002 world cup in south korea and japan helped those two nations improve relations as well .

german chancellor angela merkel also stated wednesday that she does not support expelling iran from the tournament . days after the iranian president 's statements , which called for the destruction of israel , germany 's bundesliga leader , bayern munich , played a controversial training match in tehran sparking debate as to whether it legitimized ahmadinejad 's government . no clear line dividing politics and sports bayern 's manager , uli hoeness , told reporters , " we want to reduce this to soccer only . "
however , iran 's vice president and head of sports , mohammad aliabadi , said the game did indeed have " political significance . "

they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .

they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .
assistant doctors and an increasing number of senior physicians in hospitals feel they 're being exploited . workdays that routinely involve massive amounts of poorly paid or even unpaid overtime are simply unreasonable - not to mention the danger it poses to patient 's lives . hospital directors also feel victimized .
the fact is , clinics are being confronted with enormous cost saving measures .
if they ca n't make it with what little money they have , they face closure .

the days when opening a practice automatically ensured prosperity for doctors are long over .
today , the threat of bankruptcy hangs over many a private practice .
doctors still enjoy a certain standing in society , but the reality of daily life in hospitals and clinics is humbling , and future prospects are grim . for this reason , more and more newly qualified doctors are leaving germany to work in other european countries , or the united states , where working conditions are much better . doctors feel as if they 're in the grip of a vise - caught between the expectations of their patients and the cost-saving measures dictated to them by the government .

brothers grimm fairytales are the staple of most german children 's upbringing but one grown-up thief will be kicking himself that he did n't remember aspects of the story of hansel and gretel . after making the bizarre choice to steal a karaoke machine from a shop in the western city of bochum , the bungling thief managed to rip open his winter coat in the hurried raid .
as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .

brothers grimm fairytales are the staple of most german children 's upbringing but one grown-up thief will be kicking himself that he did n't remember aspects of the story of hansel and gretel . after making the bizarre choice to steal a karaoke machine from a shop in the western city of bochum , the bungling thief managed to rip open his winter coat in the hurried raid .
as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .

they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .

they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .
assistant doctors and an increasing number of senior physicians in hospitals feel they 're being exploited . workdays that routinely involve massive amounts of poorly paid or even unpaid overtime are simply unreasonable - not to mention the danger it poses to patient 's lives . hospital directors also feel victimized .
the fact is , clinics are being confronted with enormous cost saving measures .
if they ca n't make it with what little money they have , they face closure .
due to the pressure to save , the hospitals that remain have to make do with fewer beds .
in some cases entire wards are being closed , and each year , the average length of time patients spend in hospital gets shorter . grim future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " reads this protestor 's sign doctors who have their own practices are also suffering from the funding shortage .
the days when opening a practice automatically ensured prosperity for doctors are long over .
today , the threat of bankruptcy hangs over many a private practice .
doctors still enjoy a certain standing in society , but the reality of daily life in hospitals and clinics is humbling , and future prospects are grim . for this reason , more and more newly qualified doctors are leaving germany to work in other european countries , or the united states , where working conditions are much better . doctors feel as if they 're in the grip of a vise - caught between the expectations of their patients and the cost-saving measures dictated to them by the government .
it 's a development that can only lead to the rationing of medical services .
at the same time , the ministry of health makes promises to politicians and the public that doctors are frequently unable to fulfill .
that 's what 's driving our doctors onto the streets . huge challenge however it may seem to outsiders , the reality is that healthcare in germany is not subject to political whim .
rather , the framework for the provision of care has changed dramatically for the worse .
for many years now , employee contributions to health insurance funds have been dropping .
meanwhile , medical advances mean that people are living longer than ever - something that is coupled with enormous costs .
add to this germany 's demographic shift : soon , the number of germans of employment age will decline , relative to the number of senior citizens , which is going up .
health insurance funds with shrinking means will face increasing demand for services . when it comes to healthcare , germany - in addition to many other industrialized nations - faces a huge challenge .
dramatically rising expenditure levels are unavoidable if patients are to receive optimal care .
and that means the cost of health insurance will also rise . the result is predictable - patients will have to bear increasing costs for healthcare in the form of insurance contributions or co-payments for services .
or else , medical treatment will be rationed .
it is the job of politicians to make the situation clear to the public .

killing whales for research purposes does not make sense because living creatures could be used instead , he said . diplomatic protest at the same time , the action supported environmentalists who have been blocking japanese whale hunters in the antarctic since december .
despite worldwide protest , japan continues to catch whales each year . this week , 17 governments , including britain , protests japan 's scientific whaling program diplomatically . the brazilian ambassador sent tokyo a demarche on behalf of the collective governments , demanding japan " cease all its lethal scientific research on whales . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a research boat hunting minke whales off the coast of iceland in 2003 the development came after a video release last week from greenpeace that showed the horrific drawn-out death of a minke whale at the hands of a japanese research expedition , and followed significant earlier opposition from governments , ngos and the public . deceitful move after the 10 to 20-year-old whale died on the baltic sea coast on saturday , greenpeace offered to transfer it , at their own cost , to the german oceanographic museum in stralsund for testing . the environmental group now admits the move was a trick , and said they did not inform he oceanographic museum of the fact that they had planned to used the cadaver as a political protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a humpback whale in australia greenpeace said it would leave the ocean mammal in front of the embassy until thursday afternoon , where dozens of people came to have a look at the animal . criticism from japa n the embassy criticized the action . " whale catching for research , which japan does , adheres to the regulations set forth by the international whaling commission , " embassy secretary kazuya otsuka told reuters news service . at this point , the action is an uncomfortable situation that must be tolerated , he said . " we have no other choice , " otsuka said . berlin 's senator for the interior , ehrhart körting , said he personally was sympathetic toward the protest . " it is our job to allow such congregations , " he said , adding that the police gave a short-term permission for the action , since " it did not endanger the japanese embassy . " cha n ge of strategy ? the berlin protest action might also be the first sign of a shift in strategy by greenpeace officials .
shane rattenbury , who heads an expedition on the greenpeace ship " artic sunrise " that has been trying to interfere with japanese whaling boats , told dw-radio thursday that his group will abort the mission shortly .
last weekend , a harpoon was fired from a japanese whaling ship across a greenpeace boat .

german chancellor angela merkel also stated wednesday that she does not support expelling iran from the tournament . days after the iranian president 's statements , which called for the destruction of israel , germany 's bundesliga leader , bayern munich , played a controversial training match in tehran sparking debate as to whether it legitimized ahmadinejad 's government . no clear line dividing politics and sports bayern 's manager , uli hoeness , told reporters , " we want to reduce this to soccer only .

" you can see it by the number of politicians sitting in the stands . " while politicians in democratic countries have little opportunity to gain any actual standing with voters by kicking a soccer ball or throwing the opening pitch , authoritarian regimes have repeatedly attempted to use international sporting events to legitimize their power , ehrhart added . one of the most infamous examples of the politicization of sports occurred during the 1936 summer olympic games hosted in nazi germany .

brothers grimm fairytales are the staple of most german children 's upbringing but one grown-up thief will be kicking himself that he did n't remember aspects of the story of hansel and gretel . after making the bizarre choice to steal a karaoke machine from a shop in the western city of bochum , the bungling thief managed to rip open his winter coat in the hurried raid .
as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .

new material from eastern europe and russia has made the motives of those involved more transparent . the invitation to the wannsee conference called by reinhard heydrich , chief of the nazi security police , said " meeting to be followed with breakfast . "
there was only one item on the agenda : the endlösung or " final solution " of the jewish people in europe . it was jan .
20 , 1942 .
fifteen high-ranking civil servants and ss officers met in a stately berlin villa looking out over wannsee lake .
just 90 minutes later , they had resolved to deport the jews of europe to the east and murder them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of a poster advertising adolf hitler 's book " mein kampf " is also in the exhibit since 1992 , the mansion has been a memorial and an educational center .
its permanent exhibit on " the wannsee conference and the genocide of the european jews " has now been revamped and opens to the public on thursday . " since the dramatic political changes following the demise of the soviet union , historians now have access to previously closed archives , " said museum director norbert kampe .
" this led to significant new insights into the planning and implementation of the genocide of the jews , " he said . a house of the perpetrators this previously unavailable information , from the kgb archive in moscow for example , shed new light on the role of the police battalions and the gestapo in the extermination of the jews in eastern europe , kampe said . the documentation also showed that the german civilian administration took part in the mass murder , often on its own initiative and by far more strongly , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wannsee conference took place in this room " we now know much more , " kampe said .
the new documents were evidence of the " slow process of brutalization " and the crossing of continuously new limits in the genocide of europe 's jews , he added . kampe said the wannsee museum was a " house of the perpetrators . "
its documentation is focused on the holocaust 's organization , and the center wants to further education about it . the fates of the victims , on the other hand , are emphasized in the holocaust memorial in downtown berlin , he said . biographical access to the holocaust four rooms in the new 15-room exhibition are dedicated to the wannsee conference itself , its significance , as well as the institutions and persons involved .
the central document is still the conference protocol , which was found in 1947 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wannsee memorial was opened in 1992 - the first of its kind in germany according to the museum 's pedagogical director , wolf kaiser , the new exhibition aimed to consider the interests and questions of visitors .
the thematic presentation no longer just begins in 1933 , but earlier . there is documentation of jewish life and the history of national socialism , anti-semitism and racism , as well as the beginnings of the nazi persecution of jews and the subsequent systematic mass murder of the jewish people . the systematic exclusion of jews from german society according to the 1935 nuremberg racial laws has been given more space .
" this is particularly interesting to young people and pupils , " said kaiser . visitors can also have " biographical access " to the holocaust , kampe said .
the " radicalization steps " of the annihilation are exemplified through the presentation of the fates of four jewish families , which also aims to improve young visitors ' access to the topic . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

new material from eastern europe and russia has made the motives of those involved more transparent . the invitation to the wannsee conference called by reinhard heydrich , chief of the nazi security police , said " meeting to be followed with breakfast . "

new material from eastern europe and russia has made the motives of those involved more transparent . the invitation to the wannsee conference called by reinhard heydrich , chief of the nazi security police , said " meeting to be followed with breakfast . "
there was only one item on the agenda : the endlösung or " final solution " of the jewish people in europe . it was jan .
20 , 1942 .
fifteen high-ranking civil servants and ss officers met in a stately berlin villa looking out over wannsee lake .
just 90 minutes later , they had resolved to deport the jews of europe to the east and murder them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of a poster advertising adolf hitler 's book " mein kampf " is also in the exhibit since 1992 , the mansion has been a memorial and an educational center .
its permanent exhibit on " the wannsee conference and the genocide of the european jews " has now been revamped and opens to the public on thursday . " since the dramatic political changes following the demise of the soviet union , historians now have access to previously closed archives , " said museum director norbert kampe .
" this led to significant new insights into the planning and implementation of the genocide of the jews , " he said . a house of the perpetrators this previously unavailable information , from the kgb archive in moscow for example , shed new light on the role of the police battalions and the gestapo in the extermination of the jews in eastern europe , kampe said . the documentation also showed that the german civilian administration took part in the mass murder , often on its own initiative and by far more strongly , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wannsee conference took place in this room " we now know much more , " kampe said .
the new documents were evidence of the " slow process of brutalization " and the crossing of continuously new limits in the genocide of europe 's jews , he added . kampe said the wannsee museum was a " house of the perpetrators . "
its documentation is focused on the holocaust 's organization , and the center wants to further education about it . the fates of the victims , on the other hand , are emphasized in the holocaust memorial in downtown berlin , he said . biographical access to the holocaust four rooms in the new 15-room exhibition are dedicated to the wannsee conference itself , its significance , as well as the institutions and persons involved .
the central document is still the conference protocol , which was found in 1947 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wannsee memorial was opened in 1992 - the first of its kind in germany according to the museum 's pedagogical director , wolf kaiser , the new exhibition aimed to consider the interests and questions of visitors .
the thematic presentation no longer just begins in 1933 , but earlier . there is documentation of jewish life and the history of national socialism , anti-semitism and racism , as well as the beginnings of the nazi persecution of jews and the subsequent systematic mass murder of the jewish people . the systematic exclusion of jews from german society according to the 1935 nuremberg racial laws has been given more space .
" this is particularly interesting to young people and pupils , " said kaiser . visitors can also have " biographical access " to the holocaust , kampe said .
the " radicalization steps " of the annihilation are exemplified through the presentation of the fates of four jewish families , which also aims to improve young visitors ' access to the topic . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2006 opinion : german doctors feel the pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no relief in sight for germany 's frustrated doctors a week of protest by german doctors frustrated by their working conditions culminated in a demonstration that saw thousands take to the streets on wednesday .
they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .
assistant doctors and an increasing number of senior physicians in hospitals feel they 're being exploited . workdays that routinely involve massive amounts of poorly paid or even unpaid overtime are simply unreasonable - not to mention the danger it poses to patient 's lives . hospital directors also feel victimized .
the fact is , clinics are being confronted with enormous cost saving measures .
if they ca n't make it with what little money they have , they face closure .
due to the pressure to save , the hospitals that remain have to make do with fewer beds .
in some cases entire wards are being closed , and each year , the average length of time patients spend in hospital gets shorter . grim future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " reads this protestor 's sign doctors who have their own practices are also suffering from the funding shortage .
the days when opening a practice automatically ensured prosperity for doctors are long over .
today , the threat of bankruptcy hangs over many a private practice .
doctors still enjoy a certain standing in society , but the reality of daily life in hospitals and clinics is humbling , and future prospects are grim . for this reason , more and more newly qualified doctors are leaving germany to work in other european countries , or the united states , where working conditions are much better . doctors feel as if they 're in the grip of a vise - caught between the expectations of their patients and the cost-saving measures dictated to them by the government .
it 's a development that can only lead to the rationing of medical services .
at the same time , the ministry of health makes promises to politicians and the public that doctors are frequently unable to fulfill .
that 's what 's driving our doctors onto the streets . huge challenge however it may seem to outsiders , the reality is that healthcare in germany is not subject to political whim .
rather , the framework for the provision of care has changed dramatically for the worse .
for many years now , employee contributions to health insurance funds have been dropping .
meanwhile , medical advances mean that people are living longer than ever - something that is coupled with enormous costs .
add to this germany 's demographic shift : soon , the number of germans of employment age will decline , relative to the number of senior citizens , which is going up .
health insurance funds with shrinking means will face increasing demand for services . when it comes to healthcare , germany - in addition to many other industrialized nations - faces a huge challenge .
dramatically rising expenditure levels are unavoidable if patients are to receive optimal care .
and that means the cost of health insurance will also rise . the result is predictable - patients will have to bear increasing costs for healthcare in the form of insurance contributions or co-payments for services .
or else , medical treatment will be rationed .
it is the job of politicians to make the situation clear to the public .
doctors are right to protest when government makes promises that ca n't be borne out financially , or else come to bear on those people who work in the healthcare sector . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german doctors protest against pay conditions over 20,000 doctors from hospitals and private practices all over germany took to the streets wednesday to protest against poor salaries and bureaucracy in the statutory health system .

requiring at least a year 's prior employment at the company is " disproportionate " to ensure social welfare protection or prevent wage dumping , the court said . it said better legislation on minimum wages for temporary workers could achieve the same goal .
currently , germany does not have a minimum service wage . " the court concludes that germany has infringed the provisions on the freedom to provide services , " a statement by the eu 's highest jurisdiction said . before issuing visas , german diplomatic missions were so far required to make sure that the worker had been employed for at least a year by the company planning to post him or her . berlin tightened its rules after a scandal over lax visa policies under former foreign minister joschka fischer , which critics said permitted a wave of migrants , including criminals , from countries such as ukraine to settle in germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu all but clears germany in visa affair germany 's visa policy of 2000 violated a number of eu laws , the european commission said , but subsequent amendments have been enough to avoid legal action .

as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .

brothers grimm fairytales are the staple of most german children 's upbringing but one grown-up thief will be kicking himself that he did n't remember aspects of the story of hansel and gretel . after making the bizarre choice to steal a karaoke machine from a shop in the western city of bochum , the bungling thief managed to rip open his winter coat in the hurried raid .
as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .
" all they had to do was follow the feathers .

but politicians maintained a parliamentary inquiry will still go ahead . the row surrounding alleged german secret service involvement in the opening salvos of the iraq war continued apace wednesday despite assurances by the head of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- that bnd operatives did not help the united states pick out bombing targets during the invasion of iraq . bnd chief ernst uhrlau assured the parliament 's foreign affairs committee that his agents only provided information to the united states on civilian sites to avoid in bombing raids during the opening air strike phase of the war . uhrlau 's statement goes against recent media reports that the actions of the bnd agents in baghdad were more complicated than that and that they acted as scouts for a raid aimed at taking out iraqi leader saddam hussein before the planned invasion .
the claims have caused uproar because germany strongly opposed the 2003 us-led invasion . the committee was engaged in talks late wednesday evening with the two agents at the center of the allegations and its representatives appeared six hours later to state that they accepted their denials of involvement in the raid on a restaurant on april 7 , 2003 , which failed to kill saddam and his inner circle but killed a number of civilians .
the agents also maintained that , prior to their deployment into the iraqi capital , they had had no direct contact with us forces .

rainer stinner of the fdp shared his opinion : " we will continue these investigations , " he said . " it 's about clearing up whether the rule of law was breached , how far german authorities may have taken part in that , " stinner continued , " and to what extent there was a contradiction between official statements of the government and actual conduct during the iraq war .

but politicians maintained a parliamentary inquiry will still go ahead . the row surrounding alleged german secret service involvement in the opening salvos of the iraq war continued apace wednesday despite assurances by the head of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- that bnd operatives did not help the united states pick out bombing targets during the invasion of iraq . bnd chief ernst uhrlau assured the parliament 's foreign affairs committee that his agents only provided information to the united states on civilian sites to avoid in bombing raids during the opening air strike phase of the war . uhrlau 's statement goes against recent media reports that the actions of the bnd agents in baghdad were more complicated than that and that they acted as scouts for a raid aimed at taking out iraqi leader saddam hussein before the planned invasion .
the claims have caused uproar because germany strongly opposed the 2003 us-led invasion . the committee was engaged in talks late wednesday evening with the two agents at the center of the allegations and its representatives appeared six hours later to state that they accepted their denials of involvement in the raid on a restaurant on april 7 , 2003 , which failed to kill saddam and his inner circle but killed a number of civilians .

" the discussion is not over , " he told reporters .
rainer stinner of the fdp shared his opinion : " we will continue these investigations , " he said . " it 's about clearing up whether the rule of law was breached , how far german authorities may have taken part in that , " stinner continued , " and to what extent there was a contradiction between official statements of the government and actual conduct during the iraq war .

killing whales for research purposes does not make sense because living creatures could be used instead , he said . diplomatic protest at the same time , the action supported environmentalists who have been blocking japanese whale hunters in the antarctic since december .
despite worldwide protest , japan continues to catch whales each year . this week , 17 governments , including britain , protests japan 's scientific whaling program diplomatically . the brazilian ambassador sent tokyo a demarche on behalf of the collective governments , demanding japan " cease all its lethal scientific research on whales . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a research boat hunting minke whales off the coast of iceland in 2003 the development came after a video release last week from greenpeace that showed the horrific drawn-out death of a minke whale at the hands of a japanese research expedition , and followed significant earlier opposition from governments , ngos and the public . deceitful move after the 10 to 20-year-old whale died on the baltic sea coast on saturday , greenpeace offered to transfer it , at their own cost , to the german oceanographic museum in stralsund for testing . the environmental group now admits the move was a trick , and said they did not inform he oceanographic museum of the fact that they had planned to used the cadaver as a political protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a humpback whale in australia greenpeace said it would leave the ocean mammal in front of the embassy until thursday afternoon , where dozens of people came to have a look at the animal . criticism from japa n the embassy criticized the action . " whale catching for research , which japan does , adheres to the regulations set forth by the international whaling commission , " embassy secretary kazuya otsuka told reuters news service . at this point , the action is an uncomfortable situation that must be tolerated , he said . " we have no other choice , " otsuka said . berlin 's senator for the interior , ehrhart körting , said he personally was sympathetic toward the protest . " it is our job to allow such congregations , " he said , adding that the police gave a short-term permission for the action , since " it did not endanger the japanese embassy . " cha n ge of strategy ? the berlin protest action might also be the first sign of a shift in strategy by greenpeace officials .
shane rattenbury , who heads an expedition on the greenpeace ship " artic sunrise " that has been trying to interfere with japanese whaling boats , told dw-radio thursday that his group will abort the mission shortly .
last weekend , a harpoon was fired from a japanese whaling ship across a greenpeace boat .
" we 're seriously considering changing tactics in order to return home with all crew members alive , " rattenbury said , adding that the group was planning to focus on companies that cooperate with the whaling industry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .

they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .
assistant doctors and an increasing number of senior physicians in hospitals feel they 're being exploited . workdays that routinely involve massive amounts of poorly paid or even unpaid overtime are simply unreasonable - not to mention the danger it poses to patient 's lives . hospital directors also feel victimized .
the fact is , clinics are being confronted with enormous cost saving measures .
if they ca n't make it with what little money they have , they face closure .
due to the pressure to save , the hospitals that remain have to make do with fewer beds .
in some cases entire wards are being closed , and each year , the average length of time patients spend in hospital gets shorter . grim future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " reads this protestor 's sign doctors who have their own practices are also suffering from the funding shortage .
the days when opening a practice automatically ensured prosperity for doctors are long over .
today , the threat of bankruptcy hangs over many a private practice .
doctors still enjoy a certain standing in society , but the reality of daily life in hospitals and clinics is humbling , and future prospects are grim . for this reason , more and more newly qualified doctors are leaving germany to work in other european countries , or the united states , where working conditions are much better . doctors feel as if they 're in the grip of a vise - caught between the expectations of their patients and the cost-saving measures dictated to them by the government .
it 's a development that can only lead to the rationing of medical services .
at the same time , the ministry of health makes promises to politicians and the public that doctors are frequently unable to fulfill .
that 's what 's driving our doctors onto the streets . huge challenge however it may seem to outsiders , the reality is that healthcare in germany is not subject to political whim .
rather , the framework for the provision of care has changed dramatically for the worse .
for many years now , employee contributions to health insurance funds have been dropping .
meanwhile , medical advances mean that people are living longer than ever - something that is coupled with enormous costs .
add to this germany 's demographic shift : soon , the number of germans of employment age will decline , relative to the number of senior citizens , which is going up .
health insurance funds with shrinking means will face increasing demand for services . when it comes to healthcare , germany - in addition to many other industrialized nations - faces a huge challenge .
dramatically rising expenditure levels are unavoidable if patients are to receive optimal care .
and that means the cost of health insurance will also rise . the result is predictable - patients will have to bear increasing costs for healthcare in the form of insurance contributions or co-payments for services .
or else , medical treatment will be rationed .
it is the job of politicians to make the situation clear to the public .
doctors are right to protest when government makes promises that ca n't be borne out financially , or else come to bear on those people who work in the healthcare sector . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german doctors protest against pay conditions over 20,000 doctors from hospitals and private practices all over germany took to the streets wednesday to protest against poor salaries and bureaucracy in the statutory health system .

they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .
assistant doctors and an increasing number of senior physicians in hospitals feel they 're being exploited . workdays that routinely involve massive amounts of poorly paid or even unpaid overtime are simply unreasonable - not to mention the danger it poses to patient 's lives . hospital directors also feel victimized .
the fact is , clinics are being confronted with enormous cost saving measures .
if they ca n't make it with what little money they have , they face closure .
due to the pressure to save , the hospitals that remain have to make do with fewer beds .
in some cases entire wards are being closed , and each year , the average length of time patients spend in hospital gets shorter . grim future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " reads this protestor 's sign doctors who have their own practices are also suffering from the funding shortage .
the days when opening a practice automatically ensured prosperity for doctors are long over .
today , the threat of bankruptcy hangs over many a private practice .
doctors still enjoy a certain standing in society , but the reality of daily life in hospitals and clinics is humbling , and future prospects are grim . for this reason , more and more newly qualified doctors are leaving germany to work in other european countries , or the united states , where working conditions are much better . doctors feel as if they 're in the grip of a vise - caught between the expectations of their patients and the cost-saving measures dictated to them by the government .
it 's a development that can only lead to the rationing of medical services .
at the same time , the ministry of health makes promises to politicians and the public that doctors are frequently unable to fulfill .
that 's what 's driving our doctors onto the streets . huge challenge however it may seem to outsiders , the reality is that healthcare in germany is not subject to political whim .
rather , the framework for the provision of care has changed dramatically for the worse .
for many years now , employee contributions to health insurance funds have been dropping .
meanwhile , medical advances mean that people are living longer than ever - something that is coupled with enormous costs .
add to this germany 's demographic shift : soon , the number of germans of employment age will decline , relative to the number of senior citizens , which is going up .
health insurance funds with shrinking means will face increasing demand for services . when it comes to healthcare , germany - in addition to many other industrialized nations - faces a huge challenge .
dramatically rising expenditure levels are unavoidable if patients are to receive optimal care .
and that means the cost of health insurance will also rise . the result is predictable - patients will have to bear increasing costs for healthcare in the form of insurance contributions or co-payments for services .
or else , medical treatment will be rationed .

german chancellor angela merkel also stated wednesday that she does not support expelling iran from the tournament . days after the iranian president 's statements , which called for the destruction of israel , germany 's bundesliga leader , bayern munich , played a controversial training match in tehran sparking debate as to whether it legitimized ahmadinejad 's government . no clear line dividing politics and sports bayern 's manager , uli hoeness , told reporters , " we want to reduce this to soccer only .

sporting events provide international politicians with a chance to meet without the pressure of international summits and press conferences , according to thomas löwer of philipps university in marburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ping pong " diplomacy helped mao zedong and richard nixon normalize relations in the 1970s " sporting events are always a nice meeting point for politicians , " said löwer , adding that pakistan and india 's politicians meet at international cricket matches and that the 2002 world cup in south korea and japan helped those two nations improve relations as well .
" sports provide a way for countries to get together . " but the players who make the political door-opening events possible - and who are seldom asked for their personal opinions - are not concerned with what world leaders are saying in the stands , according to reza fazeli , a soccer agent who represents a number of iranians in the german bundesliga .

new material from eastern europe and russia has made the motives of those involved more transparent . the invitation to the wannsee conference called by reinhard heydrich , chief of the nazi security police , said " meeting to be followed with breakfast . "
there was only one item on the agenda : the endlösung or " final solution " of the jewish people in europe . it was jan .

fifteen high-ranking civil servants and ss officers met in a stately berlin villa looking out over wannsee lake .
just 90 minutes later , they had resolved to deport the jews of europe to the east and murder them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of a poster advertising adolf hitler 's book " mein kampf " is also in the exhibit since 1992 , the mansion has been a memorial and an educational center .
its permanent exhibit on " the wannsee conference and the genocide of the european jews " has now been revamped and opens to the public on thursday . " since the dramatic political changes following the demise of the soviet union , historians now have access to previously closed archives , " said museum director norbert kampe .
" this led to significant new insights into the planning and implementation of the genocide of the jews , " he said . a house of the perpetrators this previously unavailable information , from the kgb archive in moscow for example , shed new light on the role of the police battalions and the gestapo in the extermination of the jews in eastern europe , kampe said . the documentation also showed that the german civilian administration took part in the mass murder , often on its own initiative and by far more strongly , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wannsee conference took place in this room " we now know much more , " kampe said .
the new documents were evidence of the " slow process of brutalization " and the crossing of continuously new limits in the genocide of europe 's jews , he added . kampe said the wannsee museum was a " house of the perpetrators . "
its documentation is focused on the holocaust 's organization , and the center wants to further education about it . the fates of the victims , on the other hand , are emphasized in the holocaust memorial in downtown berlin , he said . biographical access to the holocaust four rooms in the new 15-room exhibition are dedicated to the wannsee conference itself , its significance , as well as the institutions and persons involved .
the central document is still the conference protocol , which was found in 1947 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wannsee memorial was opened in 1992 - the first of its kind in germany according to the museum 's pedagogical director , wolf kaiser , the new exhibition aimed to consider the interests and questions of visitors .
the thematic presentation no longer just begins in 1933 , but earlier . there is documentation of jewish life and the history of national socialism , anti-semitism and racism , as well as the beginnings of the nazi persecution of jews and the subsequent systematic mass murder of the jewish people . the systematic exclusion of jews from german society according to the 1935 nuremberg racial laws has been given more space .
" this is particularly interesting to young people and pupils , " said kaiser . visitors can also have " biographical access " to the holocaust , kampe said .
the " radicalization steps " of the annihilation are exemplified through the presentation of the fates of four jewish families , which also aims to improve young visitors ' access to the topic . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

new material from eastern europe and russia has made the motives of those involved more transparent . the invitation to the wannsee conference called by reinhard heydrich , chief of the nazi security police , said " meeting to be followed with breakfast . "
there was only one item on the agenda : the endlösung or " final solution " of the jewish people in europe . it was jan .
20 , 1942 .
fifteen high-ranking civil servants and ss officers met in a stately berlin villa looking out over wannsee lake .
just 90 minutes later , they had resolved to deport the jews of europe to the east and murder them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of a poster advertising adolf hitler 's book " mein kampf " is also in the exhibit since 1992 , the mansion has been a memorial and an educational center .
its permanent exhibit on " the wannsee conference and the genocide of the european jews " has now been revamped and opens to the public on thursday . " since the dramatic political changes following the demise of the soviet union , historians now have access to previously closed archives , " said museum director norbert kampe .
" this led to significant new insights into the planning and implementation of the genocide of the jews , " he said . a house of the perpetrators this previously unavailable information , from the kgb archive in moscow for example , shed new light on the role of the police battalions and the gestapo in the extermination of the jews in eastern europe , kampe said . the documentation also showed that the german civilian administration took part in the mass murder , often on its own initiative and by far more strongly , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wannsee conference took place in this room " we now know much more , " kampe said .
the new documents were evidence of the " slow process of brutalization " and the crossing of continuously new limits in the genocide of europe 's jews , he added . kampe said the wannsee museum was a " house of the perpetrators . "
its documentation is focused on the holocaust 's organization , and the center wants to further education about it . the fates of the victims , on the other hand , are emphasized in the holocaust memorial in downtown berlin , he said . biographical access to the holocaust four rooms in the new 15-room exhibition are dedicated to the wannsee conference itself , its significance , as well as the institutions and persons involved .
the central document is still the conference protocol , which was found in 1947 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wannsee memorial was opened in 1992 - the first of its kind in germany according to the museum 's pedagogical director , wolf kaiser , the new exhibition aimed to consider the interests and questions of visitors .
the thematic presentation no longer just begins in 1933 , but earlier . there is documentation of jewish life and the history of national socialism , anti-semitism and racism , as well as the beginnings of the nazi persecution of jews and the subsequent systematic mass murder of the jewish people . the systematic exclusion of jews from german society according to the 1935 nuremberg racial laws has been given more space .
" this is particularly interesting to young people and pupils , " said kaiser . visitors can also have " biographical access " to the holocaust , kampe said .
the " radicalization steps " of the annihilation are exemplified through the presentation of the fates of four jewish families , which also aims to improve young visitors ' access to the topic . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany .

german chancellor angela merkel also stated wednesday that she does not support expelling iran from the tournament . days after the iranian president 's statements , which called for the destruction of israel , germany 's bundesliga leader , bayern munich , played a controversial training match in tehran sparking debate as to whether it legitimized ahmadinejad 's government . no clear line dividing politics and sports bayern 's manager , uli hoeness , told reporters , " we want to reduce this to soccer only . "
however , iran 's vice president and head of sports , mohammad aliabadi , said the game did indeed have " political significance . "
english broadcasts to the 50,000 fans of " peaceful use of nuclear energy is the natural claim of the iranian nation " at the beginning of the match helped demonstrate the iranian approach . but even if bayern were only interested in the 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 363,000 -rrb- they received for the 12-hour trip to tehran , it 's far too late for anyone to ignore the fusion of sports and politics , according to sociology professor gabriele klein , who focuses on movement , sport and dance at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what happens in the game is n't what 's most important when it comes to politics " sports have always been politicized , " she said .
" the actual game on the field during the soccer world cup is only a small part of the entire event .

" whether a city is a venue for world cup matches is important , because sport is much more of a mass phenomenon than other festivals .

" you can see it by the number of politicians sitting in the stands . " while politicians in democratic countries have little opportunity to gain any actual standing with voters by kicking a soccer ball or throwing the opening pitch , authoritarian regimes have repeatedly attempted to use international sporting events to legitimize their power , ehrhart added . one of the most infamous examples of the politicization of sports occurred during the 1936 summer olympic games hosted in nazi germany .
hitler used the games as a chance to showcase the third reich and impress the world by improving berlin 's sports facilities and making a show of the until-then modest olympic tradition . the positive side to politics mixing in but it 's not always negative when politicians get involved in sports .
sporting events provide international politicians with a chance to meet without the pressure of international summits and press conferences , according to thomas löwer of philipps university in marburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ping pong " diplomacy helped mao zedong and richard nixon normalize relations in the 1970s " sporting events are always a nice meeting point for politicians , " said löwer , adding that pakistan and india 's politicians meet at international cricket matches and that the 2002 world cup in south korea and japan helped those two nations improve relations as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2006 opinion : german doctors feel the pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no relief in sight for germany 's frustrated doctors a week of protest by german doctors frustrated by their working conditions culminated in a demonstration that saw thousands take to the streets on wednesday .
they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .
assistant doctors and an increasing number of senior physicians in hospitals feel they 're being exploited . workdays that routinely involve massive amounts of poorly paid or even unpaid overtime are simply unreasonable - not to mention the danger it poses to patient 's lives . hospital directors also feel victimized .
the fact is , clinics are being confronted with enormous cost saving measures .
if they ca n't make it with what little money they have , they face closure .
due to the pressure to save , the hospitals that remain have to make do with fewer beds .
in some cases entire wards are being closed , and each year , the average length of time patients spend in hospital gets shorter . grim future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " reads this protestor 's sign doctors who have their own practices are also suffering from the funding shortage .
the days when opening a practice automatically ensured prosperity for doctors are long over .
today , the threat of bankruptcy hangs over many a private practice .
doctors still enjoy a certain standing in society , but the reality of daily life in hospitals and clinics is humbling , and future prospects are grim . for this reason , more and more newly qualified doctors are leaving germany to work in other european countries , or the united states , where working conditions are much better . doctors feel as if they 're in the grip of a vise - caught between the expectations of their patients and the cost-saving measures dictated to them by the government .
it 's a development that can only lead to the rationing of medical services .
at the same time , the ministry of health makes promises to politicians and the public that doctors are frequently unable to fulfill .
that 's what 's driving our doctors onto the streets . huge challenge however it may seem to outsiders , the reality is that healthcare in germany is not subject to political whim .
rather , the framework for the provision of care has changed dramatically for the worse .
for many years now , employee contributions to health insurance funds have been dropping .
meanwhile , medical advances mean that people are living longer than ever - something that is coupled with enormous costs .
add to this germany 's demographic shift : soon , the number of germans of employment age will decline , relative to the number of senior citizens , which is going up .
health insurance funds with shrinking means will face increasing demand for services . when it comes to healthcare , germany - in addition to many other industrialized nations - faces a huge challenge .
dramatically rising expenditure levels are unavoidable if patients are to receive optimal care .
and that means the cost of health insurance will also rise . the result is predictable - patients will have to bear increasing costs for healthcare in the form of insurance contributions or co-payments for services .
or else , medical treatment will be rationed .
it is the job of politicians to make the situation clear to the public .
doctors are right to protest when government makes promises that ca n't be borne out financially , or else come to bear on those people who work in the healthcare sector . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german doctors protest against pay conditions over 20,000 doctors from hospitals and private practices all over germany took to the streets wednesday to protest against poor salaries and bureaucracy in the statutory health system .

they were right to do so , says dw 's karl zawadzky . the anger of doctors , whether they are employed by a hospital or have their own practice , is understandable .
assistant doctors and an increasing number of senior physicians in hospitals feel they 're being exploited . workdays that routinely involve massive amounts of poorly paid or even unpaid overtime are simply unreasonable - not to mention the danger it poses to patient 's lives . hospital directors also feel victimized .
the fact is , clinics are being confronted with enormous cost saving measures .
if they ca n't make it with what little money they have , they face closure .
due to the pressure to save , the hospitals that remain have to make do with fewer beds .

the days when opening a practice automatically ensured prosperity for doctors are long over .

doctors still enjoy a certain standing in society , but the reality of daily life in hospitals and clinics is humbling , and future prospects are grim . for this reason , more and more newly qualified doctors are leaving germany to work in other european countries , or the united states , where working conditions are much better . doctors feel as if they 're in the grip of a vise - caught between the expectations of their patients and the cost-saving measures dictated to them by the government .

that 's what 's driving our doctors onto the streets . huge challenge however it may seem to outsiders , the reality is that healthcare in germany is not subject to political whim .
rather , the framework for the provision of care has changed dramatically for the worse .
for many years now , employee contributions to health insurance funds have been dropping .

health insurance funds with shrinking means will face increasing demand for services . when it comes to healthcare , germany - in addition to many other industrialized nations - faces a huge challenge .
dramatically rising expenditure levels are unavoidable if patients are to receive optimal care .

killing whales for research purposes does not make sense because living creatures could be used instead , he said . diplomatic protest at the same time , the action supported environmentalists who have been blocking japanese whale hunters in the antarctic since december .
despite worldwide protest , japan continues to catch whales each year . this week , 17 governments , including britain , protests japan 's scientific whaling program diplomatically . the brazilian ambassador sent tokyo a demarche on behalf of the collective governments , demanding japan " cease all its lethal scientific research on whales . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a research boat hunting minke whales off the coast of iceland in 2003 the development came after a video release last week from greenpeace that showed the horrific drawn-out death of a minke whale at the hands of a japanese research expedition , and followed significant earlier opposition from governments , ngos and the public . deceitful move after the 10 to 20-year-old whale died on the baltic sea coast on saturday , greenpeace offered to transfer it , at their own cost , to the german oceanographic museum in stralsund for testing . the environmental group now admits the move was a trick , and said they did not inform he oceanographic museum of the fact that they had planned to used the cadaver as a political protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a humpback whale in australia greenpeace said it would leave the ocean mammal in front of the embassy until thursday afternoon , where dozens of people came to have a look at the animal . criticism from japa n the embassy criticized the action . " whale catching for research , which japan does , adheres to the regulations set forth by the international whaling commission , " embassy secretary kazuya otsuka told reuters news service . at this point , the action is an uncomfortable situation that must be tolerated , he said . " we have no other choice , " otsuka said . berlin 's senator for the interior , ehrhart körting , said he personally was sympathetic toward the protest . " it is our job to allow such congregations , " he said , adding that the police gave a short-term permission for the action , since " it did not endanger the japanese embassy . " cha n ge of strategy ? the berlin protest action might also be the first sign of a shift in strategy by greenpeace officials .
shane rattenbury , who heads an expedition on the greenpeace ship " artic sunrise " that has been trying to interfere with japanese whaling boats , told dw-radio thursday that his group will abort the mission shortly .
last weekend , a harpoon was fired from a japanese whaling ship across a greenpeace boat .

the claims have caused uproar because germany strongly opposed the 2003 us-led invasion . the committee was engaged in talks late wednesday evening with the two agents at the center of the allegations and its representatives appeared six hours later to state that they accepted their denials of involvement in the raid on a restaurant on april 7 , 2003 , which failed to kill saddam and his inner circle but killed a number of civilians .

rainer stinner of the fdp shared his opinion : " we will continue these investigations , " he said .

brothers grimm fairytales are the staple of most german children 's upbringing but one grown-up thief will be kicking himself that he did n't remember aspects of the story of hansel and gretel . after making the bizarre choice to steal a karaoke machine from a shop in the western city of bochum , the bungling thief managed to rip open his winter coat in the hurried raid .
as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .

but politicians maintained a parliamentary inquiry will still go ahead . the row surrounding alleged german secret service involvement in the opening salvos of the iraq war continued apace wednesday despite assurances by the head of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- that bnd operatives did not help the united states pick out bombing targets during the invasion of iraq . bnd chief ernst uhrlau assured the parliament 's foreign affairs committee that his agents only provided information to the united states on civilian sites to avoid in bombing raids during the opening air strike phase of the war . uhrlau 's statement goes against recent media reports that the actions of the bnd agents in baghdad were more complicated than that and that they acted as scouts for a raid aimed at taking out iraqi leader saddam hussein before the planned invasion .
the claims have caused uproar because germany strongly opposed the 2003 us-led invasion . the committee was engaged in talks late wednesday evening with the two agents at the center of the allegations and its representatives appeared six hours later to state that they accepted their denials of involvement in the raid on a restaurant on april 7 , 2003 , which failed to kill saddam and his inner circle but killed a number of civilians .
the agents also maintained that , prior to their deployment into the iraqi capital , they had had no direct contact with us forces . " the officials have credibly shown that they were not involved in any way in the preparation , planning or execution " of the bombing raid , committee chairman norbert röttgen told reporters . the bnd statements did little , however , to slow the wheels of motion moving the affair into the realm of a parliamentary inquiry . de n ials fail to slow the parliame n tary wheels of motio n politicians from the german opposition parties - the greens , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party - continued to push for an extensive investigation into whether then chancellor gerhard schröder 's government played both sides of the war , appeasing public opinion and garnering popularity by opposing military action while covertly supporting it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin said the bnd denials did not end the discussion jürgen trittin , a minister in the schröder government and leading member of the greens , said that the bnd statements did not bring closure to the allegations . " the discussion is not over , " he told reporters .
rainer stinner of the fdp shared his opinion : " we will continue these investigations , " he said . " it 's about clearing up whether the rule of law was breached , how far german authorities may have taken part in that , " stinner continued , " and to what extent there was a contradiction between official statements of the government and actual conduct during the iraq war . " " we must have a complete explanation of what happened during and after the war , " said fdp parliamentary leader wolfgang gerhardt . germa n y complicit through i n volveme n t i n baghdad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say the bnd may have indirectly identified targets norman paech of the left party was among a number of politicians who felt that the role of german agents in identifying ' non-targets ' for bombing , such as hospitals and schools , was still an unacceptable german contribution to the war . " if you specify what ca n't be shot at , that automatically frees up what can be shot at , " paech told reporters . the opposition parties voted for a formal parliamentary investigation into the affair on tuesday and are expected to gain the 25 percent of votes needed in the bundestag debate on friday for the inquiry to begin . there are 614 parliamentarians in the bundestag and the necessary amount of votes in favor to begin the investigation would be 154 .
the three opposition parties hold 166 seats in the parliament . fischer to oppose the probe as successor feels the heat six fdp members have said they will abstain , and one green parliamentarian , former foreign minister joschka fischer , is expected to oppose the probe just as he rejected it in his parliamentary group 's vote on tuesday .
however , with the left party saying it will vote unanimously for the enquiry , it will still be enough to set the investigation in motion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer -lrb- l . -rrb- and frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- were both in schröder 's cabinet at the time fischer understood his party 's desire to learn what key members of the government - including himself - knew but warned the inquiry would be used as a political weapon , the süddeutsche zeitu n g newspaper reported . his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , is under pressure because he was schröder 's chief of staff and responsible for overseeing the work of the security services at the time .
he will return from the middle east to vote in the parliamentary debate on friday but some committee members have voiced frustration they had not had time to question steinmeier ahead of the debate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what can a parliamentary inquiry accomplish in the bnd affair ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 19.01.2006 politics take to the soccer pitch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packed stadiums are often too good a stage for politicians to say no to willing to use any means at their disposal to gain the public 's favor , politicians are more than happy to stage their political battles on the soccer field , but experts wonder if it really has an effect . whether by banning nations from taking part in international sports matches or boycotting events in antagonistic countries , politicians have often used sports as a tool to make political statements and advance their own agendas . the most recent example has come from a number of german politicians who have called for banning iran from the 2006 soccer world cup in response to anti-semitic comments from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad called the holocaust a myth fifa , world soccer 's governing body , announced it would neither ban iran from this summer 's event nor get involved in political issues .
german chancellor angela merkel also stated wednesday that she does not support expelling iran from the tournament . days after the iranian president 's statements , which called for the destruction of israel , germany 's bundesliga leader , bayern munich , played a controversial training match in tehran sparking debate as to whether it legitimized ahmadinejad 's government . no clear line dividing politics and sports bayern 's manager , uli hoeness , told reporters , " we want to reduce this to soccer only . "
however , iran 's vice president and head of sports , mohammad aliabadi , said the game did indeed have " political significance . "
english broadcasts to the 50,000 fans of " peaceful use of nuclear energy is the natural claim of the iranian nation " at the beginning of the match helped demonstrate the iranian approach . but even if bayern were only interested in the 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 363,000 -rrb- they received for the 12-hour trip to tehran , it 's far too late for anyone to ignore the fusion of sports and politics , according to sociology professor gabriele klein , who focuses on movement , sport and dance at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what happens in the game is n't what 's most important when it comes to politics " sports have always been politicized , " she said .
" the actual game on the field during the soccer world cup is only a small part of the entire event . " the political furor that erupted last week over fifa 's cancellation of berlin 's world cup opening gala - an event that would n't have an effect on the tournament 's outcome - also shows there 's more to sports than which team wins . more than just a game " being named host of a large sporting event is of major importance to municipalities as well as national organizers , " klein said .
" whether a city is a venue for world cup matches is important , because sport is much more of a mass phenomenon than other festivals . " the important cultural role sports plays and the emotions it stirs up in fans make it an ideal way for politicians to gain favor among their constituents , according to hans-georg ehrhart of hamburg 's institute for peace research and security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder often tried to connect economic success with victory on the field " politicians try to push themselves into the forefront in an attempt to get some of the shine of the event to rub off on them , " he said .

" the important cultural role sports plays and the emotions it stirs up in fans make it an ideal way for politicians to gain favor among their constituents , according to hans-georg ehrhart of hamburg 's institute for peace research and security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder often tried to connect economic success with victory on the field " politicians try to push themselves into the forefront in an attempt to get some of the shine of the event to rub off on them , " he said .
" you can see it by the number of politicians sitting in the stands . " while politicians in democratic countries have little opportunity to gain any actual standing with voters by kicking a soccer ball or throwing the opening pitch , authoritarian regimes have repeatedly attempted to use international sporting events to legitimize their power , ehrhart added . one of the most infamous examples of the politicization of sports occurred during the 1936 summer olympic games hosted in nazi germany .
hitler used the games as a chance to showcase the third reich and impress the world by improving berlin 's sports facilities and making a show of the until-then modest olympic tradition . the positive side to politics mixing in but it 's not always negative when politicians get involved in sports .
sporting events provide international politicians with a chance to meet without the pressure of international summits and press conferences , according to thomas löwer of philipps university in marburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ping pong " diplomacy helped mao zedong and richard nixon normalize relations in the 1970s " sporting events are always a nice meeting point for politicians , " said löwer , adding that pakistan and india 's politicians meet at international cricket matches and that the 2002 world cup in south korea and japan helped those two nations improve relations as well .
" sports provide a way for countries to get together . " but the players who make the political door-opening events possible - and who are seldom asked for their personal opinions - are not concerned with what world leaders are saying in the stands , according to reza fazeli , a soccer agent who represents a number of iranians in the german bundesliga . " the players are athletes who are not influenced by international politics , " he said .
" politics is one thing and sports is another , and politicians should simply stay out of soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 19.01.2006 politics take to the soccer pitch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packed stadiums are often too good a stage for politicians to say no to willing to use any means at their disposal to gain the public 's favor , politicians are more than happy to stage their political battles on the soccer field , but experts wonder if it really has an effect . whether by banning nations from taking part in international sports matches or boycotting events in antagonistic countries , politicians have often used sports as a tool to make political statements and advance their own agendas . the most recent example has come from a number of german politicians who have called for banning iran from the 2006 soccer world cup in response to anti-semitic comments from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad called the holocaust a myth fifa , world soccer 's governing body , announced it would neither ban iran from this summer 's event nor get involved in political issues .
german chancellor angela merkel also stated wednesday that she does not support expelling iran from the tournament . days after the iranian president 's statements , which called for the destruction of israel , germany 's bundesliga leader , bayern munich , played a controversial training match in tehran sparking debate as to whether it legitimized ahmadinejad 's government . no clear line dividing politics and sports bayern 's manager , uli hoeness , told reporters , " we want to reduce this to soccer only . "
however , iran 's vice president and head of sports , mohammad aliabadi , said the game did indeed have " political significance . "
english broadcasts to the 50,000 fans of " peaceful use of nuclear energy is the natural claim of the iranian nation " at the beginning of the match helped demonstrate the iranian approach . but even if bayern were only interested in the 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 363,000 -rrb- they received for the 12-hour trip to tehran , it 's far too late for anyone to ignore the fusion of sports and politics , according to sociology professor gabriele klein , who focuses on movement , sport and dance at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what happens in the game is n't what 's most important when it comes to politics " sports have always been politicized , " she said .
" the actual game on the field during the soccer world cup is only a small part of the entire event . " the political furor that erupted last week over fifa 's cancellation of berlin 's world cup opening gala - an event that would n't have an effect on the tournament 's outcome - also shows there 's more to sports than which team wins . more than just a game " being named host of a large sporting event is of major importance to municipalities as well as national organizers , " klein said .
" whether a city is a venue for world cup matches is important , because sport is much more of a mass phenomenon than other festivals . " the important cultural role sports plays and the emotions it stirs up in fans make it an ideal way for politicians to gain favor among their constituents , according to hans-georg ehrhart of hamburg 's institute for peace research and security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder often tried to connect economic success with victory on the field " politicians try to push themselves into the forefront in an attempt to get some of the shine of the event to rub off on them , " he said .
" you can see it by the number of politicians sitting in the stands . " while politicians in democratic countries have little opportunity to gain any actual standing with voters by kicking a soccer ball or throwing the opening pitch , authoritarian regimes have repeatedly attempted to use international sporting events to legitimize their power , ehrhart added . one of the most infamous examples of the politicization of sports occurred during the 1936 summer olympic games hosted in nazi germany .
hitler used the games as a chance to showcase the third reich and impress the world by improving berlin 's sports facilities and making a show of the until-then modest olympic tradition . the positive side to politics mixing in but it 's not always negative when politicians get involved in sports .
sporting events provide international politicians with a chance to meet without the pressure of international summits and press conferences , according to thomas löwer of philipps university in marburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ping pong " diplomacy helped mao zedong and richard nixon normalize relations in the 1970s " sporting events are always a nice meeting point for politicians , " said löwer , adding that pakistan and india 's politicians meet at international cricket matches and that the 2002 world cup in south korea and japan helped those two nations improve relations as well .
" sports provide a way for countries to get together . " but the players who make the political door-opening events possible - and who are seldom asked for their personal opinions - are not concerned with what world leaders are saying in the stands , according to reza fazeli , a soccer agent who represents a number of iranians in the german bundesliga . " the players are athletes who are not influenced by international politics , " he said .

brothers grimm fairytales are the staple of most german children 's upbringing but one grown-up thief will be kicking himself that he did n't remember aspects of the story of hansel and gretel . after making the bizarre choice to steal a karaoke machine from a shop in the western city of bochum , the bungling thief managed to rip open his winter coat in the hurried raid .
as he fled the scene of the crime with his booty , he didn ’ t notice that his duck-down jacket was leaking feathers . just as the lost children in the grimm tale used breadcrumbs to line their route into the forest , so the thief made a trail of feathers all the way to his front door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trail did n't lead the cops to a gingerbread house but the result was just as sweet .
unfortunately , while hansel and gretel found that their route back had disappeared due to greedy birds , the fleeing crook had no such luck . trail of feathers lead cops to crook on one of the more mild and still days of wintery january , the feather trail stayed put , giving the police a solid lead .
after being alerted by an eyewitness , the police followed and arrested the shocked 36-year-old at his home . " luckily they were able to act before the next story was played out - ' gone with the wind ' , " said bochum police spokesman frank plewka .

killing whales for research purposes does not make sense because living creatures could be used instead , he said . diplomatic protest at the same time , the action supported environmentalists who have been blocking japanese whale hunters in the antarctic since december .
despite worldwide protest , japan continues to catch whales each year . this week , 17 governments , including britain , protests japan 's scientific whaling program diplomatically . the brazilian ambassador sent tokyo a demarche on behalf of the collective governments , demanding japan " cease all its lethal scientific research on whales . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a research boat hunting minke whales off the coast of iceland in 2003 the development came after a video release last week from greenpeace that showed the horrific drawn-out death of a minke whale at the hands of a japanese research expedition , and followed significant earlier opposition from governments , ngos and the public . deceitful move after the 10 to 20-year-old whale died on the baltic sea coast on saturday , greenpeace offered to transfer it , at their own cost , to the german oceanographic museum in stralsund for testing . the environmental group now admits the move was a trick , and said they did not inform he oceanographic museum of the fact that they had planned to used the cadaver as a political protest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a humpback whale in australia greenpeace said it would leave the ocean mammal in front of the embassy until thursday afternoon , where dozens of people came to have a look at the animal . criticism from japa n the embassy criticized the action . " whale catching for research , which japan does , adheres to the regulations set forth by the international whaling commission , " embassy secretary kazuya otsuka told reuters news service . at this point , the action is an uncomfortable situation that must be tolerated , he said . " we have no other choice , " otsuka said . berlin 's senator for the interior , ehrhart körting , said he personally was sympathetic toward the protest . " it is our job to allow such congregations , " he said , adding that the police gave a short-term permission for the action , since " it did not endanger the japanese embassy . " cha n ge of strategy ? the berlin protest action might also be the first sign of a shift in strategy by greenpeace officials .
shane rattenbury , who heads an expedition on the greenpeace ship " artic sunrise " that has been trying to interfere with japanese whaling boats , told dw-radio thursday that his group will abort the mission shortly .
last weekend , a harpoon was fired from a japanese whaling ship across a greenpeace boat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 19.01.2006 politics take to the soccer pitch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packed stadiums are often too good a stage for politicians to say no to willing to use any means at their disposal to gain the public 's favor , politicians are more than happy to stage their political battles on the soccer field , but experts wonder if it really has an effect . whether by banning nations from taking part in international sports matches or boycotting events in antagonistic countries , politicians have often used sports as a tool to make political statements and advance their own agendas . the most recent example has come from a number of german politicians who have called for banning iran from the 2006 soccer world cup in response to anti-semitic comments from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad called the holocaust a myth fifa , world soccer 's governing body , announced it would neither ban iran from this summer 's event nor get involved in political issues .
german chancellor angela merkel also stated wednesday that she does not support expelling iran from the tournament . days after the iranian president 's statements , which called for the destruction of israel , germany 's bundesliga leader , bayern munich , played a controversial training match in tehran sparking debate as to whether it legitimized ahmadinejad 's government . no clear line dividing politics and sports bayern 's manager , uli hoeness , told reporters , " we want to reduce this to soccer only . "
however , iran 's vice president and head of sports , mohammad aliabadi , said the game did indeed have " political significance . "
english broadcasts to the 50,000 fans of " peaceful use of nuclear energy is the natural claim of the iranian nation " at the beginning of the match helped demonstrate the iranian approach . but even if bayern were only interested in the 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 363,000 -rrb- they received for the 12-hour trip to tehran , it 's far too late for anyone to ignore the fusion of sports and politics , according to sociology professor gabriele klein , who focuses on movement , sport and dance at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what happens in the game is n't what 's most important when it comes to politics " sports have always been politicized , " she said .
" the actual game on the field during the soccer world cup is only a small part of the entire event . " the political furor that erupted last week over fifa 's cancellation of berlin 's world cup opening gala - an event that would n't have an effect on the tournament 's outcome - also shows there 's more to sports than which team wins . more than just a game " being named host of a large sporting event is of major importance to municipalities as well as national organizers , " klein said .
" whether a city is a venue for world cup matches is important , because sport is much more of a mass phenomenon than other festivals . " the important cultural role sports plays and the emotions it stirs up in fans make it an ideal way for politicians to gain favor among their constituents , according to hans-georg ehrhart of hamburg 's institute for peace research and security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder often tried to connect economic success with victory on the field " politicians try to push themselves into the forefront in an attempt to get some of the shine of the event to rub off on them , " he said .
" you can see it by the number of politicians sitting in the stands . " while politicians in democratic countries have little opportunity to gain any actual standing with voters by kicking a soccer ball or throwing the opening pitch , authoritarian regimes have repeatedly attempted to use international sporting events to legitimize their power , ehrhart added . one of the most infamous examples of the politicization of sports occurred during the 1936 summer olympic games hosted in nazi germany .
hitler used the games as a chance to showcase the third reich and impress the world by improving berlin 's sports facilities and making a show of the until-then modest olympic tradition . the positive side to politics mixing in but it 's not always negative when politicians get involved in sports .
sporting events provide international politicians with a chance to meet without the pressure of international summits and press conferences , according to thomas löwer of philipps university in marburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ping pong " diplomacy helped mao zedong and richard nixon normalize relations in the 1970s " sporting events are always a nice meeting point for politicians , " said löwer , adding that pakistan and india 's politicians meet at international cricket matches and that the 2002 world cup in south korea and japan helped those two nations improve relations as well .
" sports provide a way for countries to get together . " but the players who make the political door-opening events possible - and who are seldom asked for their personal opinions - are not concerned with what world leaders are saying in the stands , according to reza fazeli , a soccer agent who represents a number of iranians in the german bundesliga . " the players are athletes who are not influenced by international politics , " he said .
" politics is one thing and sports is another , and politicians should simply stay out of soccer .

the ex-welsh guardsman , who received serious burns to his hands and face in the war , said seeking youth and beauty on the operating table was " daft " .
he is patron of charity changing faces , which helps people with disfigurements , and has a new branch in wales .
in the uk last year the number of cosmetic surgery operations rose 34 % .
there are so many people out there who have small defects on their face or body and use surgery as an option simon weston changing faces estimates that more than 20,000 people in wales are disfigured in a way which they find distressing and affects the quality of their life .
there are an estimated 400,000 such people across the uk .
mr weston , 44 , who was left badly scarred by the argentine attack on the troop ship sir galahad , said it took him the best part of five years to come to terms with his disfigurement .
but he said he feared too many others in a similar situation were " hiding away from society " .
my face has been tucked in more times than a bed sheet at the holiday inn joan rivers joking about her cosmetic surgery he said : " if people do n't like the way i look , that 's their problem .
i 'm the one who 's got to live in my skin , not them . "
he backed the charity 's view that the degree of disfigurement a person has was not a measure of how much it affected the quality of their life .
' search for perfection ' he said : " there are so many people out there who have small defects on their face or body and use surgery as an option .
" they are not living happily .
people are always on a constant search for perfection .
" it 's becoming an obsession .
i think people who try and stay young and beautiful -lsb- through surgery -rsb- are a bit daft . "
he described the look of american comedian joan rivers , an advocate of cosmetic surgery , as " perhaps a nip-and-tuck too far " .
miss rivers has spoken about the benefits of botox , but has also joked : " my face has been tucked in more times than a bed sheet at the holiday inn " .
changing faces was founded by james partridge , 53 , who suffered severe burns to his face and hands in a road crash near usk , south wales , in 1970 while on holiday with friends .
mr partridge said : " when you have a disfigurement , you have to manage the reaction of other people , and you have to do it every single day . "

senior democrats have unveiled an honest leadership and open government act - legislation which they say will bring an end to the corruption .
earlier this week republicans announced their own package of reforms , including a ban on politicians receiving gifts .
the move follows a corruption scandal spawned by a powerful lobbyist .
the democratic attack was led by the senate minority leader harry reid .
' ethical cloud ' mr reid was flanked by other leading party members , including the democratic leader in the house of representatives , nancy pelosi , as he spoke of the proposed legislation in the library of congress .
mr reid said that during his long career in politics he had never felt as distressed and concerned as he did now .
he spoke of the culture of corruption he felt had infested government , and how change was now vital .
ms pelosi echoed his sentiments , speaking of an ethical cloud hanging over the capital and describing the current congress as the most closed and corrupt in history .
" the american people deserve a congress that represents the interest of everyday people , " ms pelosi said .
buying political influence the legislation being introduced would ban all lobbyists from offering gifts and free travel to politicians and seeks tighter controls on the movement of staff from jobs on capitol hill to lucrative lobbying posts .

on tuesday , republicans in the us congress unveiled their own package of anti-corruption reforms .

" a member of congress should be able to accept a baseball cap ... from the proud students of a local middle school , but he ... does n't need to be taken to ... dinner by a washington lobbyist , " he said .
the moves come after the guilty plea on corruption charges by lobbyist jack abramoff .
abramoff was accused of using gifts of money , foreign trips and lavish meals to buy political influence .
under the terms of a plea bargain , abramoff will now co-operate with a probe into alleged corruption among congress members .
the us justice department is believed to be investigating as many as 20 members of congress and aides , with some democrats also said to be implicated in the scandal .

the newspaper reported that debenhams has asked four banks to review its strategic options , including a possible float of its shares .
with a likely valuation of more than £ 3bn -lrb- $ 5.31bn -rrb- , it could be one of the the biggest uk floats this year .
however , the privately-owned firm has repeatedly denied speculation that it plans an early return to market .
last november , the retailer 's finance director chris woodhouse said it had no current plans to list its shares , but did not rule out a flotation in 2006 .

mr tew 's million dollar homepage , which sells pixels as advertising space , was brought down by a massive distributed denial-of-service attack launched after he refused to pay a $ 5,000 demand from blackmailers .
his venture is the latest in a long line of websites to fall foul of the net criminals who recruit so-called zombie pcs from around the world and use their net addresses to deluge sites with data .
according to security firm ciphertrust , any high profile website is ripe for this sort of cyber-crime , largely due to the ease with which attacks can be launched .
net criminals intent on bringing down sites recruit mostly windows pcs by infecting them with viruses or worms .
they then use the net addresses of these zombie pcs to deluge targeted websites with a huge amount of data , causing the servers to fall over and forcing the website offline .
middlemen to crime ciphertrust has been tracking the phenomenon of zombie computers for two years and has seen an alarming rise of nearly 50 % in the number of infected machines being recruited over the past six months .
the middlemen in these attacks tend to be home users .
people are contributing to the problem by the lack of security at home david stanley , ciphertrust this is largely a result of the sober virus which hit pcs around the world at the back-end of last year .
it estimates that 250,000 new machines are infected every day .
" china has the most zombie pcs at the moment and the us is regularly number two , with germany at number three and the uk , with just 3 % of infected machines , at number 10 , " said david stanley , managing director of ciphertrust .
for firms affected by denial-of-service attacks , there is an important knock-on effect from the sudden rise in zombie pcs .
" it is likely we will see more denial-of-service attacks , " said mr stanley .
as well as ddos -lrb- distributed denial of service -rrb- attacks , zombie pcs are also used by net criminals to launch phishing attacks and send out spam .
for cyber-criminals , a ddos attack is almost the perfect crime because it is virtually impossible to track down where it originated from .
and they also have the advantage of being able to recruit an army of unsuspecting home users , whose only crime is to pay less attention than they should to computer security .
" the middlemen in these attacks tend to be home users .
people are contributing to the problem by the lack of security at home , " said mr stanley .
people may never realise that their machine has been used in such an attack and their lives as an accessory to a criminal gang is relatively short-living .
mr stanley estimates the amount of time an infected pc is used for criminal activity is about four days .
for anyone worried that their home computer is being used as a zombie , a key sign is the sudden slowing down of the system .
" if that happens while you are sitting at the machine , unplug it and clean it up , " advised mr stanley .
changing course historically , net blackmailers have targeted firms that can ill-afford downtime , such as online betting sites and online payment firms .
online betting sites have been regular targets for web attacks paul court is director of operations at web hosting firm globix and , with both betting sites and online payment firms on the books , is used to seeing sophisticated ddos attacks .
he admits it is a daily fight to keep the criminals at bay .
but the problem has been eased by a series of techniques , including using multiple routes for traffic to get to websites and diverting suspect traffic while filters are put in place .
the fact that the targets of the past are wising up to the problem may be one reason that the criminals are now turning their attention to smaller websites .
" smaller websites tend to have quite basic hosting and these cheaper deals offer little or no protection against denial-of-service attacks , " said mr court .
it is also difficult to fix the problems retrospectively and rarely comes cheap .
as the internet enters a new era of entrepreneurship , new websites , especially those that hit the headlines , will inevitably be targeted as mr tew has found to his cost .
websites must decide whether to risk being left exposed , or dig deep in their pockets and set up the necessary battlements to protect themselves against such attacks .

but the problem has been eased by a series of techniques , including using multiple routes for traffic to get to websites and diverting suspect traffic while filters are put in place .
the fact that the targets of the past are wising up to the problem may be one reason that the criminals are now turning their attention to smaller websites .
" smaller websites tend to have quite basic hosting and these cheaper deals offer little or no protection against denial-of-service attacks , " said mr court .
it is also difficult to fix the problems retrospectively and rarely comes cheap .
as the internet enters a new era of entrepreneurship , new websites , especially those that hit the headlines , will inevitably be targeted as mr tew has found to his cost .

mr tew 's million dollar homepage , which sells pixels as advertising space , was brought down by a massive distributed denial-of-service attack launched after he refused to pay a $ 5,000 demand from blackmailers .
his venture is the latest in a long line of websites to fall foul of the net criminals who recruit so-called zombie pcs from around the world and use their net addresses to deluge sites with data .
according to security firm ciphertrust , any high profile website is ripe for this sort of cyber-crime , largely due to the ease with which attacks can be launched .
net criminals intent on bringing down sites recruit mostly windows pcs by infecting them with viruses or worms .
they then use the net addresses of these zombie pcs to deluge targeted websites with a huge amount of data , causing the servers to fall over and forcing the website offline .
middlemen to crime ciphertrust has been tracking the phenomenon of zombie computers for two years and has seen an alarming rise of nearly 50 % in the number of infected machines being recruited over the past six months .
the middlemen in these attacks tend to be home users .
people are contributing to the problem by the lack of security at home david stanley , ciphertrust this is largely a result of the sober virus which hit pcs around the world at the back-end of last year .
it estimates that 250,000 new machines are infected every day .
" china has the most zombie pcs at the moment and the us is regularly number two , with germany at number three and the uk , with just 3 % of infected machines , at number 10 , " said david stanley , managing director of ciphertrust .
for firms affected by denial-of-service attacks , there is an important knock-on effect from the sudden rise in zombie pcs .
" it is likely we will see more denial-of-service attacks , " said mr stanley .
as well as ddos -lrb- distributed denial of service -rrb- attacks , zombie pcs are also used by net criminals to launch phishing attacks and send out spam .
for cyber-criminals , a ddos attack is almost the perfect crime because it is virtually impossible to track down where it originated from .
and they also have the advantage of being able to recruit an army of unsuspecting home users , whose only crime is to pay less attention than they should to computer security .
" the middlemen in these attacks tend to be home users .
people are contributing to the problem by the lack of security at home , " said mr stanley .
people may never realise that their machine has been used in such an attack and their lives as an accessory to a criminal gang is relatively short-living .
mr stanley estimates the amount of time an infected pc is used for criminal activity is about four days .
for anyone worried that their home computer is being used as a zombie , a key sign is the sudden slowing down of the system .

mr tew 's million dollar homepage , which sells pixels as advertising space , was brought down by a massive distributed denial-of-service attack launched after he refused to pay a $ 5,000 demand from blackmailers .
his venture is the latest in a long line of websites to fall foul of the net criminals who recruit so-called zombie pcs from around the world and use their net addresses to deluge sites with data .
according to security firm ciphertrust , any high profile website is ripe for this sort of cyber-crime , largely due to the ease with which attacks can be launched .
net criminals intent on bringing down sites recruit mostly windows pcs by infecting them with viruses or worms .
they then use the net addresses of these zombie pcs to deluge targeted websites with a huge amount of data , causing the servers to fall over and forcing the website offline .
middlemen to crime ciphertrust has been tracking the phenomenon of zombie computers for two years and has seen an alarming rise of nearly 50 % in the number of infected machines being recruited over the past six months .
the middlemen in these attacks tend to be home users .
people are contributing to the problem by the lack of security at home david stanley , ciphertrust this is largely a result of the sober virus which hit pcs around the world at the back-end of last year .
it estimates that 250,000 new machines are infected every day .
" china has the most zombie pcs at the moment and the us is regularly number two , with germany at number three and the uk , with just 3 % of infected machines , at number 10 , " said david stanley , managing director of ciphertrust .
for firms affected by denial-of-service attacks , there is an important knock-on effect from the sudden rise in zombie pcs .
" it is likely we will see more denial-of-service attacks , " said mr stanley .
as well as ddos -lrb- distributed denial of service -rrb- attacks , zombie pcs are also used by net criminals to launch phishing attacks and send out spam .
for cyber-criminals , a ddos attack is almost the perfect crime because it is virtually impossible to track down where it originated from .
and they also have the advantage of being able to recruit an army of unsuspecting home users , whose only crime is to pay less attention than they should to computer security .
" the middlemen in these attacks tend to be home users .
people are contributing to the problem by the lack of security at home , " said mr stanley .
people may never realise that their machine has been used in such an attack and their lives as an accessory to a criminal gang is relatively short-living .
mr stanley estimates the amount of time an infected pc is used for criminal activity is about four days .
for anyone worried that their home computer is being used as a zombie , a key sign is the sudden slowing down of the system .
" if that happens while you are sitting at the machine , unplug it and clean it up , " advised mr stanley .
changing course historically , net blackmailers have targeted firms that can ill-afford downtime , such as online betting sites and online payment firms .
online betting sites have been regular targets for web attacks paul court is director of operations at web hosting firm globix and , with both betting sites and online payment firms on the books , is used to seeing sophisticated ddos attacks .
he admits it is a daily fight to keep the criminals at bay .
but the problem has been eased by a series of techniques , including using multiple routes for traffic to get to websites and diverting suspect traffic while filters are put in place .
the fact that the targets of the past are wising up to the problem may be one reason that the criminals are now turning their attention to smaller websites .
" smaller websites tend to have quite basic hosting and these cheaper deals offer little or no protection against denial-of-service attacks , " said mr court .
it is also difficult to fix the problems retrospectively and rarely comes cheap .
as the internet enters a new era of entrepreneurship , new websites , especially those that hit the headlines , will inevitably be targeted as mr tew has found to his cost .
websites must decide whether to risk being left exposed , or dig deep in their pockets and set up the necessary battlements to protect themselves against such attacks .

but the problem has been eased by a series of techniques , including using multiple routes for traffic to get to websites and diverting suspect traffic while filters are put in place .
the fact that the targets of the past are wising up to the problem may be one reason that the criminals are now turning their attention to smaller websites .
" smaller websites tend to have quite basic hosting and these cheaper deals offer little or no protection against denial-of-service attacks , " said mr court .
it is also difficult to fix the problems retrospectively and rarely comes cheap .
as the internet enters a new era of entrepreneurship , new websites , especially those that hit the headlines , will inevitably be targeted as mr tew has found to his cost .
websites must decide whether to risk being left exposed , or dig deep in their pockets and set up the necessary battlements to protect themselves against such attacks .

mr tew 's million dollar homepage , which sells pixels as advertising space , was brought down by a massive distributed denial-of-service attack launched after he refused to pay a $ 5,000 demand from blackmailers .
his venture is the latest in a long line of websites to fall foul of the net criminals who recruit so-called zombie pcs from around the world and use their net addresses to deluge sites with data .
according to security firm ciphertrust , any high profile website is ripe for this sort of cyber-crime , largely due to the ease with which attacks can be launched .
net criminals intent on bringing down sites recruit mostly windows pcs by infecting them with viruses or worms .
they then use the net addresses of these zombie pcs to deluge targeted websites with a huge amount of data , causing the servers to fall over and forcing the website offline .
middlemen to crime ciphertrust has been tracking the phenomenon of zombie computers for two years and has seen an alarming rise of nearly 50 % in the number of infected machines being recruited over the past six months . "
the middlemen in these attacks tend to be home users .
people are contributing to the problem by the lack of security at home " david stanley , ciphertrust this is largely a result of the sober virus which hit pcs around the world at the back-end of last year .
it estimates that 250,000 new machines are infected every day .
" china has the most zombie pcs at the moment and the us is regularly number two , with germany at number three and the uk , with just 3 % of infected machines , at number 10 , " said david stanley , managing director of ciphertrust .
for firms affected by denial-of-service attacks , there is an important knock-on effect from the sudden rise in zombie pcs .
" it is likely we will see more denial-of-service attacks , " said mr stanley .
as well as ddos -lrb- distributed denial of service -rrb- attacks , zombie pcs are also used by net criminals to launch phishing attacks and send out spam .
for cyber-criminals , a ddos attack is almost the perfect crime because it is virtually impossible to track down where it originated from .
and they also have the advantage of being able to recruit an army of unsuspecting home users , whose only crime is to pay less attention than they should to computer security .
" the middlemen in these attacks tend to be home users .
people are contributing to the problem by the lack of security at home , " said mr stanley .
people may never realise that their machine has been used in such an attack and their lives as an accessory to a criminal gang is relatively short-living .
mr stanley estimates the amount of time an infected pc is used for criminal activity is about four days .
for anyone worried that their home computer is being used as a zombie , a key sign is the sudden slowing down of the system .
" if that happens while you are sitting at the machine , unplug it and clean it up , " advised mr stanley .
changing course historically , net blackmailers have targeted firms that can ill-afford downtime , such as online betting sites and online payment firms .
paul court is director of operations at web hosting firm globix and , with both betting sites and online payment firms on the books , is used to seeing sophisticated ddos attacks .

the government says it will no longer fund post office card accounts , which are used to pay pensions and benefits to up to four million people .
they replaced the old system of booklets and cash over the counter .
rural communities and inner cities could be the hardest hit if the accounts close , sub-postmasters say .

" we 've done everything that the government asked of us to make changes needed to make a modern post office .
we clearly feel betrayed . "
threat to communities with many people still without bank accounts , post office card accounts are used to collect benefits or pensions .
if these are taken away many post offices could be forced to close as business drops off , sub-postmasters warn .
in response , the department of work and pensions pointed out that the post office card account was only one of 25 accounts used by people to access pensions and benefits .
seventy-five percent of customers , the government said , already have their money paid into bank accounts which can be accessed through post office counters .
but mr baker was adamant that the survival of some post offices was threatened and that other businesses could be affected by the closure , such as local hairdressers and chemists .
" if you take the post office out of the community , the community dies , " he warned .
there are about 14,500 post offices and sub post offices in the uk .
in the last two years , 2,500 post offices have shut down .

the singer had originally said her tracks could not be sung by contestants in the new series of the show .
judge simon cowell said : " i think that by ignoring the show you 're ignoring the audience who put you there . "
but the chart-topping star has now agreed that the next generation of wannabes can use her material .
american idol must obtain permission from owners of song licenses in order for the music to be used on the show .
negotiations clarkson 's record label sony bmg said her management was in negotiations over which of her songs could be used .
spokesman roger widynowski had earlier said the singer was not allowing her songs to be licensed for other purposes and he had not been informed of negotiations .
in an interview with the associated press agency in 2005 clarkson said she was aware that her career started on american idol .
" they always talk about the big first thing that you did , " she said .
" i think the only thing that i do mind is i do n't want people to only focus on that . "
clarkson was the first winner of american idol when it was launched in 2002 .
she has since had transatlantic hits with singles since u been gone and miss independent , among others , and she earned a grammy nomination for best pop vocal album with her album breakaway .
