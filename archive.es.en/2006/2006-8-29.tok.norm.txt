did you know that birds sing in dialect ?
the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .
" the best way is to sit and wait , and wait , and wait .
you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !
the unique archive is housed in berlin , but the recordings have become globe-trotters .
audio-installations in museums and zoological gardens around the world make use of them , and rare animal voices can be heard in the digital edition of germany 's well-known brockhaus encyclopedia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermit always had a lot more to say than " riiiibit " what 's more , the voices of six endangered species can even be downloaded as mobile phone ring tones as part of an unusual environmental protection campaign called " nature is calling , " which is sponsored by the german government . the archive also combines nature with technology and makes use of the internet to complete research in bioacoustics . researchers from the humboldt university animal sound archive have teamed up with computer science experts from bonn university to investigate noise pollution .

the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .
" the best way is to sit and wait , and wait , and wait .
you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !
the unique archive is housed in berlin , but the recordings have become globe-trotters .
audio-installations in museums and zoological gardens around the world make use of them , and rare animal voices can be heard in the digital edition of germany 's well-known brockhaus encyclopedia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermit always had a lot more to say than " riiiibit " what 's more , the voices of six endangered species can even be downloaded as mobile phone ring tones as part of an unusual environmental protection campaign called " nature is calling , " which is sponsored by the german government . the archive also combines nature with technology and makes use of the internet to complete research in bioacoustics . researchers from the humboldt university animal sound archive have teamed up with computer science experts from bonn university to investigate noise pollution . " in germany you can hardly find a place without noise pollution , " frommolt said .
" i believe that this noise pollution could be a problem for the animals and i 'm hoping the world will change .

" the links between small and mid-sized companies have to be strengthened , " glos said , pointing out that india was also of immense interest as an outsourcing location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's michael glos ' first visit to india since being appointed economics minister last year glos ' visit comes amid reports of record-high growth in bilateral trade between india and germany .
german exports to india surged by 43.7 percent to 2.84 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.64 billion -rrb- in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period last year .
at the same time , indian exports to india rose by 32.8 percent to 2.13 billion euros . glos said his visit was meant to contribute to breaking the psychological mark of 10 billion euros in bilateral trade - an ambitious goal set by former german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to delhi two years ago . " i 'm really optimistic that this meeting today will be a milestone towards that , " said glos , who met with indian trade minister kamal nath . german interest in india growing glos ' visit to delhi , his first since being appointed economics minister last year , was meant to focus renewed attention on india and help to further break down barriers to bilateral trade and business . though german giants such as siemens , bosch and bayer can boast of a long business presence and tradition in india , other firms have hesitated in making the leap .
while the us , south korea or japan have all moved into india early , experts have long bemoaned that germany has been too slow in gaining a foothold in the market there . at the same time , there 's no denying that india , with its booming economy and growing middle class , has become increasingly important for the german economy in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel met with indian prime minister manmohan singh at the hanover fair in april experts point out that german interest in india has increased further still since the hanover industrial fair in april where the spotlight was on india .
indian companies , too , are spreading their wings and eyeing investments in germany , particularly in the field of pharmaceuticals . investments still lagging at the same time , many say the robust growth in bilateral trade is n't reflected in the field of investments . dietrich kebschull , chairman of the indo-german export promotion council told german public broadcaster ndr that india still suffered from a bad image , which he said explained the wariness on the part of german mid-sized companies . " they 're much too skeptical , too hesitant , particularly when you compare it with other countries like china , which i think germans are too uncritical of , " kebschull said .
" on the other hand , people have too many reservations about india .

ever wonder what a mole has to say ?
did you know that birds sing in dialect ?
the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .
" the best way is to sit and wait , and wait , and wait .
you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !
the unique archive is housed in berlin , but the recordings have become globe-trotters .
audio-installations in museums and zoological gardens around the world make use of them , and rare animal voices can be heard in the digital edition of germany 's well-known brockhaus encyclopedia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermit always had a lot more to say than " riiiibit " what 's more , the voices of six endangered species can even be downloaded as mobile phone ring tones as part of an unusual environmental protection campaign called " nature is calling , " which is sponsored by the german government . the archive also combines nature with technology and makes use of the internet to complete research in bioacoustics . researchers from the humboldt university animal sound archive have teamed up with computer science experts from bonn university to investigate noise pollution . " in germany you can hardly find a place without noise pollution , " frommolt said .
" i believe that this noise pollution could be a problem for the animals and i 'm hoping the world will change .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers . " she also stressed the need for hezbollah to be disarmed , and added that " in my eyes , an organization that supports terror can not be part of a political system .
these organizations use democracy to spread their antidemocratic ideas . " a n arms embargo " by all mea n s n ecessary " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tzipi livni with frank-walter steinmeier these remarks echoed those made previously on monday when , directly after talks with steinmeier , livni said the beefed-up international force in southern lebanon must enforce an arms embargo against hezbollah " by all means necessary , " calling it the top priority in securing the fragile ceasefire . livni said that the conflict would certainly flare again if the shiite militia 's arms supply were not stopped . " the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .
" i believe that israel and germany share the same interest and the same view , as part of the international community , for the need of the application of the security council resolution , " she said before talks with chancellor angela merkel . merkel said that in addition to a contribution to the force , berlin would make a fresh effort to help restart to the middle east peace process between israel and the palestinians . " that is exactly what we are going to talk about , " the chancellor added before the meeting . germany has pledged to deploy a small naval unit to patrol the coastline of the border region between israel and lebanon and stop the flow of arms .
but it has ruled out sending combat troops or police .
lebanon had also requested technical assistance from germany for its border police at frontier checkpoints and airports . liv n i accuses ira n of stalli n g for time livni also took the opportunity to voice israel 's concern over the " threat " posed by iran , saying the islamic state was trying to buy time to build a nuclear weapon and she surged world leaders monday to confront the islamic republic . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " she said .
" the world must understand that it must act so that uranium enrichment is stopped in iran .
this is crucial for world peace . " livni said the international community could not accept an equivocal iranian response to an incentives package for stopping sensitive nuclear work , calling it an attempt to stall until tehran can develop a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni honored holocaust victims at grunewald station and later in a speech before the german council on foreign relations , she demanded un sanctions against iran .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers .

" the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .

with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .

political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .

but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

the center said it hoped the documents would give insight into the activities of the waffen ss , which was closely involved in the systematic killing of jews . efraim zuroff , director of the wiesenthal center , demanded in an open letter to grass that the 78-year-old writer provide further details concerning the documents in addition to what he wrote in his latest autobiographical book " beim häuten der zwiebel " -lrb- " peeling onions " -rrb- . wiesenthal center requests grass ' help " while access to the archives will certainly help facilitate historical research , documents alone can not give a complete picture of a person 's war service , " zuroff told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simon wiesenthal center describes its late namesake as a " freelance nazi hunter " in his letter , zuroff specifically requested that grass elaborate on any officers and enlisted men he could remember from his unit and exactly where and when he served . he called grass ' description in his recently published book of the events in 1945 " very thin , " according to reports . employees of the berlin archive holding grass ' military service documents released them to the press last thursday prior to obtaining the author 's permission , according to a netzeitung.de report .
on friday , grass formally gave the archive permission to make the files public . alexander dix , data protection commissioner for the state of berlin , called the premature disclosure illegal and unacceptable . doubts over the validity of grass ' book several german media organizations have suggested there were discrepancies between grass ' latest book " peeling onions , " currently no. 1 on the bestseller list in germany , and the contents of the newly released nazi documents . in particular , the date of his recruitment and the precise division he served in came under question .
light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .
his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned .

17 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

" the links between small and mid-sized companies have to be strengthened , " glos said , pointing out that india was also of immense interest as an outsourcing location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's michael glos ' first visit to india since being appointed economics minister last year glos ' visit comes amid reports of record-high growth in bilateral trade between india and germany .
german exports to india surged by 43.7 percent to 2.84 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.64 billion -rrb- in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period last year .

only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .
but there has also been a noticeable change in israel 's basic position - namely the sudden willingness to be integrated in international solutions . who will se n d what , where a n d whe n ? this is certainly a positive development .
if only it were accompanied by a truly determined and demonstrative negotiations with the international community .
despite all the optimistic statements coming out of new york , this is exactly what has been missing . even with new pledges of additional troops to beef up the 2,000-man un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- with 3,500 additional soldiers , it is still unclear which countries will be sending troops where and when .
still , at the beginning of the fragile ceasefire put in place two weeks ago , even the first steps to build unifil up seemed far away . however , there are still more undecided than decided .
the troops ' exact mandate has not been established , and most of the countries - including germany - would rather send their navies to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .
beirut , which believes unifil should help the lebanese army on the ground in the country 's south instead of turning into a maritime force off the lebanese coast , is n't excited about the plan . leba n ese hold o n to sovereig n ty the lebanese government is not interested in giving up more sovereignty , which is why it insists on remaining responsible for the country 's eastern border with syria and cutting off arms smuggling there .
that is the reason why lebanese prime minister fuad siniora repeatedly said he is not considering a violent disarming of hezbollah , which runs the danger of provoking fights the army would not win . instead the prime minister wants the slow integration of hezbollah into the regular military .
hezbollah is not a foreign element but a part of lebanon .
but it can no longer be a state within a state and uncontrolled militia and needs to change and integrate itself into a political power . but this will not be achieved with military force - neither on the part of beirut nor from unifil .
expert political tactics are necessary and quick solutions are not to be expected .
that is why it is not absurd to plan the process - when it finally begins - not for weeks and months but for years .

13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

but now those forecasts of doom appear to be premature and unjustified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive , but highly trained workers are important " the strong pressure to cut costs then led to a narrow minded focus on high labor costs here , but that view has widened considerably , " said jan miller , a spokesman for ernst & young business consultants , who conducted a recent industry survey .
" other factors , such as our highly qualified workforce and innovative edge , are equally important .
what has changed is the image of germany as a production site .
the hourly cost of hiring an industrial worker in the western part of germany is the third highest in the world at 28 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , compared to 19 euros in the us and only 4 euros in slovakia and poland , according to the cologne institute for economic research . high labor costs , but u n rivalled germa n i n frastructure " such high costs to the employer are a major drawback in germany , but the tightly woven net of suppliers , services and high tech research , which supports the industrial core is unrivalled here , " said martin leutz , spokesman for gesamtmetall , an employer 's association in the metal and electrical sector which represents the big players such as siemens , daimler-chrysler and bmw , as well as mid-sized and small companies .
" this kind of cluster structure , which allows for depth , diversity , streamlined efficiency and quick decision making , is hard to duplicate in other countries . " outsourcing of low-skilled , labor intensive work to countries such as poland , slovakia and the czech republic actually allows german companies to concentrate on maintaining a leading technological edge in world markets and producing premium products , leutz added . o n ly o n e major assembly pla n t outside germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final assembly of a mercedes roadster in the port city of bremen " the manufacturing base in germany has always been incredibly strong .
our main industrial imprint is home-based , " said florian martens , spokesman for the flagship mercedes division of daimler-chrysler , who added that the assembly plant in alabama is the only major one outside of germany .
" all our engines for example are made in germany , even those for suvs in the us market .
in the us though , it made sense to set up production facilities as a hedge against currency fluctuations , and to be close to our primary customers . " although eastern europe and china are ranked high among auto suppliers as production sites , germany comes close behind with 72 percent of those surveyed finding the home market attractive , according to the ernst & young survey . " the gospel that we have been preaching for years is to remain home-based , " said christoph stürmer , an auto analyst at global insight , a forecasting institute in frankfurt .
" even an equally qualified automotive engineer in china for example does not necessarily cost less than a german one . " productio n problems i n remote , developi n g cou n tries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky business in china stürmer added that plenty of western automobile manufacturers have discovered that the cost of quality control in countries such as india and china is too high , which has wound up wrecking their business model . " in developing countries , it is much harder to find highly qualified engineers who can perform complex tasks or plan strategically , " he said .
" transport and logistic costs also makes it risky to go to extreme locations , which is why eastern europe , which is geographically and culturally closer , is looked on more favorably . " although it is evident that automotive investments streams are increasingly headed eastwards , automakers still remain committed to their western european manufacturing base , " he said , adding that production in eastern europe is focused on the lower segment of mass-market vehicles , and is likely to stabilize at a level of 25 percent of total european output in the foreseeable future . and production in the premium market would remain primarily german . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating the damage of high labor costs for german business a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .
what 's the poi n t ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski is critical of the weimar triangle the majority of criticisms levelled at " weimar triangle " have taken place in private , but the group found itself in the headlines this year .
at the beginning of 2006 , newly-appointed polish president lech kaczynski provocatively questioned the sense and purpose of this special partnership , which he saw as not beneficial .
the current tension between germany and poland would have also played a role in putting the alliance under pressure .
for the anniversary summit , held in july with chancellor merkel and president chirac , kaczynski cancelled at the last minute - for health reasons .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .

that is the reason why lebanese prime minister fuad siniora repeatedly said he is not considering a violent disarming of hezbollah , which runs the danger of provoking fights the army would not win . instead the prime minister wants the slow integration of hezbollah into the regular military .
hezbollah is not a foreign element but a part of lebanon .

the center said it hoped the documents would give insight into the activities of the waffen ss , which was closely involved in the systematic killing of jews . efraim zuroff , director of the wiesenthal center , demanded in an open letter to grass that the 78-year-old writer provide further details concerning the documents in addition to what he wrote in his latest autobiographical book " beim häuten der zwiebel " -lrb- " peeling onions " -rrb- . wiesenthal center requests grass ' help " while access to the archives will certainly help facilitate historical research , documents alone can not give a complete picture of a person 's war service , " zuroff told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simon wiesenthal center describes its late namesake as a " freelance nazi hunter " in his letter , zuroff specifically requested that grass elaborate on any officers and enlisted men he could remember from his unit and exactly where and when he served . he called grass ' description in his recently published book of the events in 1945 " very thin , " according to reports . employees of the berlin archive holding grass ' military service documents released them to the press last thursday prior to obtaining the author 's permission , according to a netzeitung.de report .
on friday , grass formally gave the archive permission to make the files public . alexander dix , data protection commissioner for the state of berlin , called the premature disclosure illegal and unacceptable . doubts over the validity of grass ' book several german media organizations have suggested there were discrepancies between grass ' latest book " peeling onions , " currently no. 1 on the bestseller list in germany , and the contents of the newly released nazi documents . in particular , the date of his recruitment and the precise division he served in came under question .
light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .
his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned .
-lrb- aug .
17 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .
-lrb- aug .
15 , 2006 -rrb- nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

" the links between small and mid-sized companies have to be strengthened , " glos said , pointing out that india was also of immense interest as an outsourcing location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's michael glos ' first visit to india since being appointed economics minister last year glos ' visit comes amid reports of record-high growth in bilateral trade between india and germany .
german exports to india surged by 43.7 percent to 2.84 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.64 billion -rrb- in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period last year .
at the same time , indian exports to india rose by 32.8 percent to 2.13 billion euros . glos said his visit was meant to contribute to breaking the psychological mark of 10 billion euros in bilateral trade - an ambitious goal set by former german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to delhi two years ago . " i 'm really optimistic that this meeting today will be a milestone towards that , " said glos , who met with indian trade minister kamal nath . german interest in india growing glos ' visit to delhi , his first since being appointed economics minister last year , was meant to focus renewed attention on india and help to further break down barriers to bilateral trade and business . though german giants such as siemens , bosch and bayer can boast of a long business presence and tradition in india , other firms have hesitated in making the leap .
while the us , south korea or japan have all moved into india early , experts have long bemoaned that germany has been too slow in gaining a foothold in the market there . at the same time , there 's no denying that india , with its booming economy and growing middle class , has become increasingly important for the german economy in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel met with indian prime minister manmohan singh at the hanover fair in april experts point out that german interest in india has increased further still since the hanover industrial fair in april where the spotlight was on india .
indian companies , too , are spreading their wings and eyeing investments in germany , particularly in the field of pharmaceuticals . investments still lagging at the same time , many say the robust growth in bilateral trade is n't reflected in the field of investments . dietrich kebschull , chairman of the indo-german export promotion council told german public broadcaster ndr that india still suffered from a bad image , which he said explained the wariness on the part of german mid-sized companies . " they 're much too skeptical , too hesitant , particularly when you compare it with other countries like china , which i think germans are too uncritical of , " kebschull said .
" on the other hand , people have too many reservations about india . " infrastructure tops the list of foreign investors complaints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is plagued by near-daily power failures and shortages " infrastructure is the biggest problem in india and at the same time offers huge chances , " andreas flach from corporate consultancy ernst & young told ndr .
" investments in streets , bridges , ports , airports as well as the energy sector are estimated to reach more than 150 billion euros in the next six to seven years . " other woes hobbling india 's economic rise include excessive bureaucracy , high custom duties and taxes . more chances than risks experts , however , remain confident that , given india 's yearly growth rates of 8 percent and possibly more , the country in the long run holds more golden opportunities than risks for germany . " the indian economy has developed positively and in a stable manner over the past years and there 's enormous enthusiasm in the country .
i 'm convinced that we 'll have a completely different picture in the next five to 10 years , " said flach . that message seems to have reached some germans investors . on tuesday , european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , which is part of glos ' business delegation , said it planned to invest up to 2 billion euros in india in the next 15 years .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

the center said it hoped the documents would give insight into the activities of the waffen ss , which was closely involved in the systematic killing of jews . efraim zuroff , director of the wiesenthal center , demanded in an open letter to grass that the 78-year-old writer provide further details concerning the documents in addition to what he wrote in his latest autobiographical book " beim häuten der zwiebel " -lrb- " peeling onions " -rrb- . wiesenthal center requests grass ' help " while access to the archives will certainly help facilitate historical research , documents alone can not give a complete picture of a person 's war service , " zuroff told reporters .

on friday , grass formally gave the archive permission to make the files public . alexander dix , data protection commissioner for the state of berlin , called the premature disclosure illegal and unacceptable . doubts over the validity of grass ' book several german media organizations have suggested there were discrepancies between grass ' latest book " peeling onions , " currently no. 1 on the bestseller list in germany , and the contents of the newly released nazi documents . in particular , the date of his recruitment and the precise division he served in came under question .
light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .

on friday , grass formally gave the archive permission to make the files public . alexander dix , data protection commissioner for the state of berlin , called the premature disclosure illegal and unacceptable . doubts over the validity of grass ' book several german media organizations have suggested there were discrepancies between grass ' latest book " peeling onions , " currently no. 1 on the bestseller list in germany , and the contents of the newly released nazi documents . in particular , the date of his recruitment and the precise division he served in came under question .
light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .

what has changed is the image of germany as a production site .
the hourly cost of hiring an industrial worker in the western part of germany is the third highest in the world at 28 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , compared to 19 euros in the us and only 4 euros in slovakia and poland , according to the cologne institute for economic research . high labor costs , but u n rivalled germa n i n frastructure " such high costs to the employer are a major drawback in germany , but the tightly woven net of suppliers , services and high tech research , which supports the industrial core is unrivalled here , " said martin leutz , spokesman for gesamtmetall , an employer 's association in the metal and electrical sector which represents the big players such as siemens , daimler-chrysler and bmw , as well as mid-sized and small companies .

" transport and logistic costs also makes it risky to go to extreme locations , which is why eastern europe , which is geographically and culturally closer , is looked on more favorably .

but now those forecasts of doom appear to be premature and unjustified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive , but highly trained workers are important " the strong pressure to cut costs then led to a narrow minded focus on high labor costs here , but that view has widened considerably , " said jan miller , a spokesman for ernst & young business consultants , who conducted a recent industry survey .
" other factors , such as our highly qualified workforce and innovative edge , are equally important .
what has changed is the image of germany as a production site .
the hourly cost of hiring an industrial worker in the western part of germany is the third highest in the world at 28 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , compared to 19 euros in the us and only 4 euros in slovakia and poland , according to the cologne institute for economic research . high labor costs , but u n rivalled germa n i n frastructure " such high costs to the employer are a major drawback in germany , but the tightly woven net of suppliers , services and high tech research , which supports the industrial core is unrivalled here , " said martin leutz , spokesman for gesamtmetall , an employer 's association in the metal and electrical sector which represents the big players such as siemens , daimler-chrysler and bmw , as well as mid-sized and small companies .
" this kind of cluster structure , which allows for depth , diversity , streamlined efficiency and quick decision making , is hard to duplicate in other countries . " outsourcing of low-skilled , labor intensive work to countries such as poland , slovakia and the czech republic actually allows german companies to concentrate on maintaining a leading technological edge in world markets and producing premium products , leutz added . o n ly o n e major assembly pla n t outside germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final assembly of a mercedes roadster in the port city of bremen " the manufacturing base in germany has always been incredibly strong .
our main industrial imprint is home-based , " said florian martens , spokesman for the flagship mercedes division of daimler-chrysler , who added that the assembly plant in alabama is the only major one outside of germany .
" all our engines for example are made in germany , even those for suvs in the us market .
in the us though , it made sense to set up production facilities as a hedge against currency fluctuations , and to be close to our primary customers . " although eastern europe and china are ranked high among auto suppliers as production sites , germany comes close behind with 72 percent of those surveyed finding the home market attractive , according to the ernst & young survey . " the gospel that we have been preaching for years is to remain home-based , " said christoph stürmer , an auto analyst at global insight , a forecasting institute in frankfurt .
" even an equally qualified automotive engineer in china for example does not necessarily cost less than a german one . " productio n problems i n remote , developi n g cou n tries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky business in china stürmer added that plenty of western automobile manufacturers have discovered that the cost of quality control in countries such as india and china is too high , which has wound up wrecking their business model . " in developing countries , it is much harder to find highly qualified engineers who can perform complex tasks or plan strategically , " he said .
" transport and logistic costs also makes it risky to go to extreme locations , which is why eastern europe , which is geographically and culturally closer , is looked on more favorably . " although it is evident that automotive investments streams are increasingly headed eastwards , automakers still remain committed to their western european manufacturing base , " he said , adding that production in eastern europe is focused on the lower segment of mass-market vehicles , and is likely to stabilize at a level of 25 percent of total european output in the foreseeable future . and production in the premium market would remain primarily german . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating the damage of high labor costs for german business a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .

did you know that birds sing in dialect ?
the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .

you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !

did you know that birds sing in dialect ?
the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .

you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !
the unique archive is housed in berlin , but the recordings have become globe-trotters .
audio-installations in museums and zoological gardens around the world make use of them , and rare animal voices can be heard in the digital edition of germany 's well-known brockhaus encyclopedia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermit always had a lot more to say than " riiiibit " what 's more , the voices of six endangered species can even be downloaded as mobile phone ring tones as part of an unusual environmental protection campaign called " nature is calling , " which is sponsored by the german government . the archive also combines nature with technology and makes use of the internet to complete research in bioacoustics . researchers from the humboldt university animal sound archive have teamed up with computer science experts from bonn university to investigate noise pollution .

only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .
but there has also been a noticeable change in israel 's basic position - namely the sudden willingness to be integrated in international solutions . who will se n d what , where a n d whe n ? this is certainly a positive development .
if only it were accompanied by a truly determined and demonstrative negotiations with the international community .
despite all the optimistic statements coming out of new york , this is exactly what has been missing . even with new pledges of additional troops to beef up the 2,000-man un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- with 3,500 additional soldiers , it is still unclear which countries will be sending troops where and when .
still , at the beginning of the fragile ceasefire put in place two weeks ago , even the first steps to build unifil up seemed far away . however , there are still more undecided than decided .
the troops ' exact mandate has not been established , and most of the countries - including germany - would rather send their navies to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .
beirut , which believes unifil should help the lebanese army on the ground in the country 's south instead of turning into a maritime force off the lebanese coast , is n't excited about the plan . leba n ese hold o n to sovereig n ty the lebanese government is not interested in giving up more sovereignty , which is why it insists on remaining responsible for the country 's eastern border with syria and cutting off arms smuggling there .
that is the reason why lebanese prime minister fuad siniora repeatedly said he is not considering a violent disarming of hezbollah , which runs the danger of provoking fights the army would not win . instead the prime minister wants the slow integration of hezbollah into the regular military .
hezbollah is not a foreign element but a part of lebanon .
but it can no longer be a state within a state and uncontrolled militia and needs to change and integrate itself into a political power . but this will not be achieved with military force - neither on the part of beirut nor from unifil .
expert political tactics are necessary and quick solutions are not to be expected .
that is why it is not absurd to plan the process - when it finally begins - not for weeks and months but for years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2006 günter grass ' revelations bring praise and suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as critics analyze grass , his memoir is a bestseller the simon wiesenthal center has welcomed günter grass ' decision to make his nazi service documents available for historical research , but the papers have led some to doubt the soundness of his recently published memoir . the simon wiesenthal center , an international jewish human rights organization , welcomed nobel prize laureate günter grass ' decision to release official documents in berlin concerning his service in the nazi waffen ss .
the center said it hoped the documents would give insight into the activities of the waffen ss , which was closely involved in the systematic killing of jews . efraim zuroff , director of the wiesenthal center , demanded in an open letter to grass that the 78-year-old writer provide further details concerning the documents in addition to what he wrote in his latest autobiographical book " beim häuten der zwiebel " -lrb- " peeling onions " -rrb- . wiesenthal center requests grass ' help " while access to the archives will certainly help facilitate historical research , documents alone can not give a complete picture of a person 's war service , " zuroff told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simon wiesenthal center describes its late namesake as a " freelance nazi hunter " in his letter , zuroff specifically requested that grass elaborate on any officers and enlisted men he could remember from his unit and exactly where and when he served . he called grass ' description in his recently published book of the events in 1945 " very thin , " according to reports . employees of the berlin archive holding grass ' military service documents released them to the press last thursday prior to obtaining the author 's permission , according to a netzeitung.de report .
on friday , grass formally gave the archive permission to make the files public . alexander dix , data protection commissioner for the state of berlin , called the premature disclosure illegal and unacceptable . doubts over the validity of grass ' book several german media organizations have suggested there were discrepancies between grass ' latest book " peeling onions , " currently no. 1 on the bestseller list in germany , and the contents of the newly released nazi documents . in particular , the date of his recruitment and the precise division he served in came under question .
light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .
his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned .
-lrb- aug .
17 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .
-lrb- aug .
15 , 2006 -rrb- nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .
but there has also been a noticeable change in israel 's basic position - namely the sudden willingness to be integrated in international solutions . who will se n d what , where a n d whe n ? this is certainly a positive development .
if only it were accompanied by a truly determined and demonstrative negotiations with the international community .
despite all the optimistic statements coming out of new york , this is exactly what has been missing . even with new pledges of additional troops to beef up the 2,000-man un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- with 3,500 additional soldiers , it is still unclear which countries will be sending troops where and when .
still , at the beginning of the fragile ceasefire put in place two weeks ago , even the first steps to build unifil up seemed far away . however , there are still more undecided than decided .
the troops ' exact mandate has not been established , and most of the countries - including germany - would rather send their navies to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .
beirut , which believes unifil should help the lebanese army on the ground in the country 's south instead of turning into a maritime force off the lebanese coast , is n't excited about the plan . leba n ese hold o n to sovereig n ty the lebanese government is not interested in giving up more sovereignty , which is why it insists on remaining responsible for the country 's eastern border with syria and cutting off arms smuggling there .
that is the reason why lebanese prime minister fuad siniora repeatedly said he is not considering a violent disarming of hezbollah , which runs the danger of provoking fights the army would not win . instead the prime minister wants the slow integration of hezbollah into the regular military .
hezbollah is not a foreign element but a part of lebanon .
but it can no longer be a state within a state and uncontrolled militia and needs to change and integrate itself into a political power . but this will not be achieved with military force - neither on the part of beirut nor from unifil .
expert political tactics are necessary and quick solutions are not to be expected .
that is why it is not absurd to plan the process - when it finally begins - not for weeks and months but for years .
that 's one more reason why most countries are not warming up to a substantial commitment in lebanon . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t -lrb- sms -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy prepares for troop deployment in lebanon prime minister romano prodi 's government was expected to clear the deployment of 2,500 italian troops for a un peacekeeping force in lebanon late on monday .

but now those forecasts of doom appear to be premature and unjustified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive , but highly trained workers are important " the strong pressure to cut costs then led to a narrow minded focus on high labor costs here , but that view has widened considerably , " said jan miller , a spokesman for ernst & young business consultants , who conducted a recent industry survey .
" other factors , such as our highly qualified workforce and innovative edge , are equally important .
what has changed is the image of germany as a production site .
the hourly cost of hiring an industrial worker in the western part of germany is the third highest in the world at 28 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , compared to 19 euros in the us and only 4 euros in slovakia and poland , according to the cologne institute for economic research . high labor costs , but u n rivalled germa n i n frastructure " such high costs to the employer are a major drawback in germany , but the tightly woven net of suppliers , services and high tech research , which supports the industrial core is unrivalled here , " said martin leutz , spokesman for gesamtmetall , an employer 's association in the metal and electrical sector which represents the big players such as siemens , daimler-chrysler and bmw , as well as mid-sized and small companies .
" this kind of cluster structure , which allows for depth , diversity , streamlined efficiency and quick decision making , is hard to duplicate in other countries . " outsourcing of low-skilled , labor intensive work to countries such as poland , slovakia and the czech republic actually allows german companies to concentrate on maintaining a leading technological edge in world markets and producing premium products , leutz added . o n ly o n e major assembly pla n t outside germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final assembly of a mercedes roadster in the port city of bremen " the manufacturing base in germany has always been incredibly strong .
our main industrial imprint is home-based , " said florian martens , spokesman for the flagship mercedes division of daimler-chrysler , who added that the assembly plant in alabama is the only major one outside of germany .
" all our engines for example are made in germany , even those for suvs in the us market .
in the us though , it made sense to set up production facilities as a hedge against currency fluctuations , and to be close to our primary customers . " although eastern europe and china are ranked high among auto suppliers as production sites , germany comes close behind with 72 percent of those surveyed finding the home market attractive , according to the ernst & young survey . " the gospel that we have been preaching for years is to remain home-based , " said christoph stürmer , an auto analyst at global insight , a forecasting institute in frankfurt .
" even an equally qualified automotive engineer in china for example does not necessarily cost less than a german one . " productio n problems i n remote , developi n g cou n tries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky business in china stürmer added that plenty of western automobile manufacturers have discovered that the cost of quality control in countries such as india and china is too high , which has wound up wrecking their business model . " in developing countries , it is much harder to find highly qualified engineers who can perform complex tasks or plan strategically , " he said .
" transport and logistic costs also makes it risky to go to extreme locations , which is why eastern europe , which is geographically and culturally closer , is looked on more favorably . " although it is evident that automotive investments streams are increasingly headed eastwards , automakers still remain committed to their western european manufacturing base , " he said , adding that production in eastern europe is focused on the lower segment of mass-market vehicles , and is likely to stabilize at a level of 25 percent of total european output in the foreseeable future . and production in the premium market would remain primarily german . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating the damage of high labor costs for german business a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .
other economic experts say such statistics are misleading and that german labor costs are average .

but now those forecasts of doom appear to be premature and unjustified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive , but highly trained workers are important " the strong pressure to cut costs then led to a narrow minded focus on high labor costs here , but that view has widened considerably , " said jan miller , a spokesman for ernst & young business consultants , who conducted a recent industry survey .
" other factors , such as our highly qualified workforce and innovative edge , are equally important .
what has changed is the image of germany as a production site .
the hourly cost of hiring an industrial worker in the western part of germany is the third highest in the world at 28 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , compared to 19 euros in the us and only 4 euros in slovakia and poland , according to the cologne institute for economic research . high labor costs , but u n rivalled germa n i n frastructure " such high costs to the employer are a major drawback in germany , but the tightly woven net of suppliers , services and high tech research , which supports the industrial core is unrivalled here , " said martin leutz , spokesman for gesamtmetall , an employer 's association in the metal and electrical sector which represents the big players such as siemens , daimler-chrysler and bmw , as well as mid-sized and small companies .
" this kind of cluster structure , which allows for depth , diversity , streamlined efficiency and quick decision making , is hard to duplicate in other countries . " outsourcing of low-skilled , labor intensive work to countries such as poland , slovakia and the czech republic actually allows german companies to concentrate on maintaining a leading technological edge in world markets and producing premium products , leutz added . o n ly o n e major assembly pla n t outside germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final assembly of a mercedes roadster in the port city of bremen " the manufacturing base in germany has always been incredibly strong .
our main industrial imprint is home-based , " said florian martens , spokesman for the flagship mercedes division of daimler-chrysler , who added that the assembly plant in alabama is the only major one outside of germany .
" all our engines for example are made in germany , even those for suvs in the us market .
in the us though , it made sense to set up production facilities as a hedge against currency fluctuations , and to be close to our primary customers . " although eastern europe and china are ranked high among auto suppliers as production sites , germany comes close behind with 72 percent of those surveyed finding the home market attractive , according to the ernst & young survey . " the gospel that we have been preaching for years is to remain home-based , " said christoph stürmer , an auto analyst at global insight , a forecasting institute in frankfurt .
" even an equally qualified automotive engineer in china for example does not necessarily cost less than a german one . " productio n problems i n remote , developi n g cou n tries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky business in china stürmer added that plenty of western automobile manufacturers have discovered that the cost of quality control in countries such as india and china is too high , which has wound up wrecking their business model . " in developing countries , it is much harder to find highly qualified engineers who can perform complex tasks or plan strategically , " he said .
" transport and logistic costs also makes it risky to go to extreme locations , which is why eastern europe , which is geographically and culturally closer , is looked on more favorably . " although it is evident that automotive investments streams are increasingly headed eastwards , automakers still remain committed to their western european manufacturing base , " he said , adding that production in eastern europe is focused on the lower segment of mass-market vehicles , and is likely to stabilize at a level of 25 percent of total european output in the foreseeable future . and production in the premium market would remain primarily german . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating the damage of high labor costs for german business a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .
" history is full of horrible crimes , which have to be handled maturely , seriously and respectfully .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .
but there has also been a noticeable change in israel 's basic position - namely the sudden willingness to be integrated in international solutions . who will se n d what , where a n d whe n ? this is certainly a positive development .
if only it were accompanied by a truly determined and demonstrative negotiations with the international community .
despite all the optimistic statements coming out of new york , this is exactly what has been missing . even with new pledges of additional troops to beef up the 2,000-man un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- with 3,500 additional soldiers , it is still unclear which countries will be sending troops where and when .
still , at the beginning of the fragile ceasefire put in place two weeks ago , even the first steps to build unifil up seemed far away . however , there are still more undecided than decided .
the troops ' exact mandate has not been established , and most of the countries - including germany - would rather send their navies to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .
beirut , which believes unifil should help the lebanese army on the ground in the country 's south instead of turning into a maritime force off the lebanese coast , is n't excited about the plan . leba n ese hold o n to sovereig n ty the lebanese government is not interested in giving up more sovereignty , which is why it insists on remaining responsible for the country 's eastern border with syria and cutting off arms smuggling there .
that is the reason why lebanese prime minister fuad siniora repeatedly said he is not considering a violent disarming of hezbollah , which runs the danger of provoking fights the army would not win . instead the prime minister wants the slow integration of hezbollah into the regular military .
hezbollah is not a foreign element but a part of lebanon .
but it can no longer be a state within a state and uncontrolled militia and needs to change and integrate itself into a political power . but this will not be achieved with military force - neither on the part of beirut nor from unifil .
expert political tactics are necessary and quick solutions are not to be expected .
that is why it is not absurd to plan the process - when it finally begins - not for weeks and months but for years .
that 's one more reason why most countries are not warming up to a substantial commitment in lebanon . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t -lrb- sms -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy prepares for troop deployment in lebanon prime minister romano prodi 's government was expected to clear the deployment of 2,500 italian troops for a un peacekeeping force in lebanon late on monday .

there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .

why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer .

ever wonder what a mole has to say ?
did you know that birds sing in dialect ?
the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .
" the best way is to sit and wait , and wait , and wait .
you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !
the unique archive is housed in berlin , but the recordings have become globe-trotters .
audio-installations in museums and zoological gardens around the world make use of them , and rare animal voices can be heard in the digital edition of germany 's well-known brockhaus encyclopedia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermit always had a lot more to say than " riiiibit " what 's more , the voices of six endangered species can even be downloaded as mobile phone ring tones as part of an unusual environmental protection campaign called " nature is calling , " which is sponsored by the german government . the archive also combines nature with technology and makes use of the internet to complete research in bioacoustics . researchers from the humboldt university animal sound archive have teamed up with computer science experts from bonn university to investigate noise pollution . " in germany you can hardly find a place without noise pollution , " frommolt said .
" i believe that this noise pollution could be a problem for the animals and i 'm hoping the world will change .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .

but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

" other factors , such as our highly qualified workforce and innovative edge , are equally important .
what has changed is the image of germany as a production site .
the hourly cost of hiring an industrial worker in the western part of germany is the third highest in the world at 28 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , compared to 19 euros in the us and only 4 euros in slovakia and poland , according to the cologne institute for economic research . high labor costs , but u n rivalled germa n i n frastructure " such high costs to the employer are a major drawback in germany , but the tightly woven net of suppliers , services and high tech research , which supports the industrial core is unrivalled here , " said martin leutz , spokesman for gesamtmetall , an employer 's association in the metal and electrical sector which represents the big players such as siemens , daimler-chrysler and bmw , as well as mid-sized and small companies .
" this kind of cluster structure , which allows for depth , diversity , streamlined efficiency and quick decision making , is hard to duplicate in other countries . " outsourcing of low-skilled , labor intensive work to countries such as poland , slovakia and the czech republic actually allows german companies to concentrate on maintaining a leading technological edge in world markets and producing premium products , leutz added . o n ly o n e major assembly pla n t outside germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final assembly of a mercedes roadster in the port city of bremen " the manufacturing base in germany has always been incredibly strong .

" although eastern europe and china are ranked high among auto suppliers as production sites , germany comes close behind with 72 percent of those surveyed finding the home market attractive , according to the ernst & young survey . " the gospel that we have been preaching for years is to remain home-based , " said christoph stürmer , an auto analyst at global insight , a forecasting institute in frankfurt .

" in developing countries , it is much harder to find highly qualified engineers who can perform complex tasks or plan strategically , " he said .
" transport and logistic costs also makes it risky to go to extreme locations , which is why eastern europe , which is geographically and culturally closer , is looked on more favorably . " although it is evident that automotive investments streams are increasingly headed eastwards , automakers still remain committed to their western european manufacturing base , " he said , adding that production in eastern europe is focused on the lower segment of mass-market vehicles , and is likely to stabilize at a level of 25 percent of total european output in the foreseeable future . and production in the premium market would remain primarily german . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating the damage of high labor costs for german business a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .

" other factors , such as our highly qualified workforce and innovative edge , are equally important .
what has changed is the image of germany as a production site .
the hourly cost of hiring an industrial worker in the western part of germany is the third highest in the world at 28 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , compared to 19 euros in the us and only 4 euros in slovakia and poland , according to the cologne institute for economic research . high labor costs , but u n rivalled germa n i n frastructure " such high costs to the employer are a major drawback in germany , but the tightly woven net of suppliers , services and high tech research , which supports the industrial core is unrivalled here , " said martin leutz , spokesman for gesamtmetall , an employer 's association in the metal and electrical sector which represents the big players such as siemens , daimler-chrysler and bmw , as well as mid-sized and small companies .

" the gospel that we have been preaching for years is to remain home-based , " said christoph stürmer , an auto analyst at global insight , a forecasting institute in frankfurt .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers . " she also stressed the need for hezbollah to be disarmed , and added that " in my eyes , an organization that supports terror can not be part of a political system .
these organizations use democracy to spread their antidemocratic ideas . " a n arms embargo " by all mea n s n ecessary " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tzipi livni with frank-walter steinmeier these remarks echoed those made previously on monday when , directly after talks with steinmeier , livni said the beefed-up international force in southern lebanon must enforce an arms embargo against hezbollah " by all means necessary , " calling it the top priority in securing the fragile ceasefire . livni said that the conflict would certainly flare again if the shiite militia 's arms supply were not stopped . " the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .
" i believe that israel and germany share the same interest and the same view , as part of the international community , for the need of the application of the security council resolution , " she said before talks with chancellor angela merkel . merkel said that in addition to a contribution to the force , berlin would make a fresh effort to help restart to the middle east peace process between israel and the palestinians . " that is exactly what we are going to talk about , " the chancellor added before the meeting . germany has pledged to deploy a small naval unit to patrol the coastline of the border region between israel and lebanon and stop the flow of arms .
but it has ruled out sending combat troops or police .
lebanon had also requested technical assistance from germany for its border police at frontier checkpoints and airports . liv n i accuses ira n of stalli n g for time livni also took the opportunity to voice israel 's concern over the " threat " posed by iran , saying the islamic state was trying to buy time to build a nuclear weapon and she surged world leaders monday to confront the islamic republic . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " she said .
" the world must understand that it must act so that uranium enrichment is stopped in iran .
this is crucial for world peace .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers . " she also stressed the need for hezbollah to be disarmed , and added that " in my eyes , an organization that supports terror can not be part of a political system .
these organizations use democracy to spread their antidemocratic ideas . " a n arms embargo " by all mea n s n ecessary " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tzipi livni with frank-walter steinmeier these remarks echoed those made previously on monday when , directly after talks with steinmeier , livni said the beefed-up international force in southern lebanon must enforce an arms embargo against hezbollah " by all means necessary , " calling it the top priority in securing the fragile ceasefire . livni said that the conflict would certainly flare again if the shiite militia 's arms supply were not stopped . " the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .
" i believe that israel and germany share the same interest and the same view , as part of the international community , for the need of the application of the security council resolution , " she said before talks with chancellor angela merkel . merkel said that in addition to a contribution to the force , berlin would make a fresh effort to help restart to the middle east peace process between israel and the palestinians . " that is exactly what we are going to talk about , " the chancellor added before the meeting . germany has pledged to deploy a small naval unit to patrol the coastline of the border region between israel and lebanon and stop the flow of arms .
but it has ruled out sending combat troops or police .
lebanon had also requested technical assistance from germany for its border police at frontier checkpoints and airports . liv n i accuses ira n of stalli n g for time livni also took the opportunity to voice israel 's concern over the " threat " posed by iran , saying the islamic state was trying to buy time to build a nuclear weapon and she surged world leaders monday to confront the islamic republic . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " she said .
" the world must understand that it must act so that uranium enrichment is stopped in iran .
this is crucial for world peace . " livni said the international community could not accept an equivocal iranian response to an incentives package for stopping sensitive nuclear work , calling it an attempt to stall until tehran can develop a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni honored holocaust victims at grunewald station and later in a speech before the german council on foreign relations , she demanded un sanctions against iran . " this is a test for the international community , " she said .

only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .
but there has also been a noticeable change in israel 's basic position - namely the sudden willingness to be integrated in international solutions . who will se n d what , where a n d whe n ? this is certainly a positive development .
if only it were accompanied by a truly determined and demonstrative negotiations with the international community .
despite all the optimistic statements coming out of new york , this is exactly what has been missing . even with new pledges of additional troops to beef up the 2,000-man un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- with 3,500 additional soldiers , it is still unclear which countries will be sending troops where and when .
still , at the beginning of the fragile ceasefire put in place two weeks ago , even the first steps to build unifil up seemed far away . however , there are still more undecided than decided .
the troops ' exact mandate has not been established , and most of the countries - including germany - would rather send their navies to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .
beirut , which believes unifil should help the lebanese army on the ground in the country 's south instead of turning into a maritime force off the lebanese coast , is n't excited about the plan . leba n ese hold o n to sovereig n ty the lebanese government is not interested in giving up more sovereignty , which is why it insists on remaining responsible for the country 's eastern border with syria and cutting off arms smuggling there .
that is the reason why lebanese prime minister fuad siniora repeatedly said he is not considering a violent disarming of hezbollah , which runs the danger of provoking fights the army would not win . instead the prime minister wants the slow integration of hezbollah into the regular military .
hezbollah is not a foreign element but a part of lebanon .
but it can no longer be a state within a state and uncontrolled militia and needs to change and integrate itself into a political power . but this will not be achieved with military force - neither on the part of beirut nor from unifil .
expert political tactics are necessary and quick solutions are not to be expected .
that is why it is not absurd to plan the process - when it finally begins - not for weeks and months but for years .

still , at the beginning of the fragile ceasefire put in place two weeks ago , even the first steps to build unifil up seemed far away . however , there are still more undecided than decided .
the troops ' exact mandate has not been established , and most of the countries - including germany - would rather send their navies to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .
beirut , which believes unifil should help the lebanese army on the ground in the country 's south instead of turning into a maritime force off the lebanese coast , is n't excited about the plan . leba n ese hold o n to sovereig n ty the lebanese government is not interested in giving up more sovereignty , which is why it insists on remaining responsible for the country 's eastern border with syria and cutting off arms smuggling there .
that is the reason why lebanese prime minister fuad siniora repeatedly said he is not considering a violent disarming of hezbollah , which runs the danger of provoking fights the army would not win . instead the prime minister wants the slow integration of hezbollah into the regular military .
hezbollah is not a foreign element but a part of lebanon .
but it can no longer be a state within a state and uncontrolled militia and needs to change and integrate itself into a political power . but this will not be achieved with military force - neither on the part of beirut nor from unifil .
expert political tactics are necessary and quick solutions are not to be expected .
that is why it is not absurd to plan the process - when it finally begins - not for weeks and months but for years .

only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .
but there has also been a noticeable change in israel 's basic position - namely the sudden willingness to be integrated in international solutions . who will se n d what , where a n d whe n ? this is certainly a positive development .
if only it were accompanied by a truly determined and demonstrative negotiations with the international community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2006 günter grass ' revelations bring praise and suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as critics analyze grass , his memoir is a bestseller the simon wiesenthal center has welcomed günter grass ' decision to make his nazi service documents available for historical research , but the papers have led some to doubt the soundness of his recently published memoir . the simon wiesenthal center , an international jewish human rights organization , welcomed nobel prize laureate günter grass ' decision to release official documents in berlin concerning his service in the nazi waffen ss .
the center said it hoped the documents would give insight into the activities of the waffen ss , which was closely involved in the systematic killing of jews . efraim zuroff , director of the wiesenthal center , demanded in an open letter to grass that the 78-year-old writer provide further details concerning the documents in addition to what he wrote in his latest autobiographical book " beim häuten der zwiebel " -lrb- " peeling onions " -rrb- . wiesenthal center requests grass ' help " while access to the archives will certainly help facilitate historical research , documents alone can not give a complete picture of a person 's war service , " zuroff told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simon wiesenthal center describes its late namesake as a " freelance nazi hunter " in his letter , zuroff specifically requested that grass elaborate on any officers and enlisted men he could remember from his unit and exactly where and when he served . he called grass ' description in his recently published book of the events in 1945 " very thin , " according to reports . employees of the berlin archive holding grass ' military service documents released them to the press last thursday prior to obtaining the author 's permission , according to a netzeitung.de report .
on friday , grass formally gave the archive permission to make the files public . alexander dix , data protection commissioner for the state of berlin , called the premature disclosure illegal and unacceptable . doubts over the validity of grass ' book several german media organizations have suggested there were discrepancies between grass ' latest book " peeling onions , " currently no. 1 on the bestseller list in germany , and the contents of the newly released nazi documents . in particular , the date of his recruitment and the precise division he served in came under question .
light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .
his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned .
-lrb- aug .
17 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

15 , 2006 -rrb- nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .

that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .

marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : violence in the middle east steinmeier cancels talks with syrian president propaganda wars fight for headlines in the middle east " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " eu takes charge in cleaning oil spill on lebanese coast current affairs -pipe- 29.08.2006 opinion : plenty left undecided for un peacekeeping force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pledges were made to send the first set of troops to strengthen the un 's mission in lebanon on monday , but a number of questions for the international community remain unanswered , says dw 's peter philipp . in the past israel has been suspicious and dismissive when it comes to putting an international force into place to reduce violence , but seems to have fundamentally changed . foreign minister tzipi livni has formally called for a strong united nations force for southern lebanon and can even imagine that it could become a model for dealing with the palestinians .
only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .
but there has also been a noticeable change in israel 's basic position - namely the sudden willingness to be integrated in international solutions . who will se n d what , where a n d whe n ? this is certainly a positive development .
if only it were accompanied by a truly determined and demonstrative negotiations with the international community .
despite all the optimistic statements coming out of new york , this is exactly what has been missing . even with new pledges of additional troops to beef up the 2,000-man un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- with 3,500 additional soldiers , it is still unclear which countries will be sending troops where and when .
still , at the beginning of the fragile ceasefire put in place two weeks ago , even the first steps to build unifil up seemed far away . however , there are still more undecided than decided .
the troops ' exact mandate has not been established , and most of the countries - including germany - would rather send their navies to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .
beirut , which believes unifil should help the lebanese army on the ground in the country 's south instead of turning into a maritime force off the lebanese coast , is n't excited about the plan . leba n ese hold o n to sovereig n ty the lebanese government is not interested in giving up more sovereignty , which is why it insists on remaining responsible for the country 's eastern border with syria and cutting off arms smuggling there .
that is the reason why lebanese prime minister fuad siniora repeatedly said he is not considering a violent disarming of hezbollah , which runs the danger of provoking fights the army would not win . instead the prime minister wants the slow integration of hezbollah into the regular military .
hezbollah is not a foreign element but a part of lebanon .
but it can no longer be a state within a state and uncontrolled militia and needs to change and integrate itself into a political power . but this will not be achieved with military force - neither on the part of beirut nor from unifil .
expert political tactics are necessary and quick solutions are not to be expected .
that is why it is not absurd to plan the process - when it finally begins - not for weeks and months but for years .
that 's one more reason why most countries are not warming up to a substantial commitment in lebanon . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t -lrb- sms -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy prepares for troop deployment in lebanon prime minister romano prodi 's government was expected to clear the deployment of 2,500 italian troops for a un peacekeeping force in lebanon late on monday .

light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .

" we have said everything in our response .
i think the time to use the instrument of the security council has expired , " ahmadinejad told reporters , referring to an iranian answer to a western package of incentives over its nuclear program .
" i see it as unlikely that they want to use it -lrb- the security council -rrb- .

the iranian nation has chosen that based upon international regulations , it wants to use it and no one can stop it , " he added . the un security council has given iran an august 31 deadline to suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities - processes which can produce fuel for civilian reactors or explosive material for warheads .
iran has insisted it has no intention of abandoning such work and faces the threat of un sanctions should it fail to comply . iran response to package " exceptional " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear program carries on at pace " i think that the opportunity that iran has given the europeans is extremely exceptional for fairly resolving all issues .
of course , that is if they are interested in justice and i hope they will be , " said ahmadinejad . iran had laid out a framework for talks in its reply to an offer by the five permanent security council members plus germany of incentives in exchange for a suspension of enrichment . asked specifically if iran would halt enrichment , even for a short period , ahmadinejad replied : " in that -lrb- iran 's response to the six-nation offer -rrb- , we announced that any kind of dialogue should be based upon the certain rights of the iranian nation . " the iranian president also took the opportunity to chide the americans and british for what he said was extreme arrogance on their part since the end of world war ii .

" the debate should be uncensored in order for the american people to be able to listen to what we say and they should not restrict the american people from hearing the truth . " ahmadinejad then turned his attention to another of iran 's foes : israel .
iran wanted the root of tensions in the middle east to be " removed , " he said , in a comment harking back to statement made last year in which he referred to israel as a tumor . " our position on the middle east is clear .
we want the root of tensions to be removed .
during these 60 years what was the root of massacres , crimes and conflicts ? "

ever wonder what a mole has to say ?
did you know that birds sing in dialect ?
the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .
" the best way is to sit and wait , and wait , and wait .
you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !
the unique archive is housed in berlin , but the recordings have become globe-trotters .
audio-installations in museums and zoological gardens around the world make use of them , and rare animal voices can be heard in the digital edition of germany 's well-known brockhaus encyclopedia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermit always had a lot more to say than " riiiibit " what 's more , the voices of six endangered species can even be downloaded as mobile phone ring tones as part of an unusual environmental protection campaign called " nature is calling , " which is sponsored by the german government . the archive also combines nature with technology and makes use of the internet to complete research in bioacoustics . researchers from the humboldt university animal sound archive have teamed up with computer science experts from bonn university to investigate noise pollution . " in germany you can hardly find a place without noise pollution , " frommolt said .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers . " she also stressed the need for hezbollah to be disarmed , and added that " in my eyes , an organization that supports terror can not be part of a political system .
these organizations use democracy to spread their antidemocratic ideas . " a n arms embargo " by all mea n s n ecessary " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tzipi livni with frank-walter steinmeier these remarks echoed those made previously on monday when , directly after talks with steinmeier , livni said the beefed-up international force in southern lebanon must enforce an arms embargo against hezbollah " by all means necessary , " calling it the top priority in securing the fragile ceasefire . livni said that the conflict would certainly flare again if the shiite militia 's arms supply were not stopped . " the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .
" i believe that israel and germany share the same interest and the same view , as part of the international community , for the need of the application of the security council resolution , " she said before talks with chancellor angela merkel . merkel said that in addition to a contribution to the force , berlin would make a fresh effort to help restart to the middle east peace process between israel and the palestinians . " that is exactly what we are going to talk about , " the chancellor added before the meeting . germany has pledged to deploy a small naval unit to patrol the coastline of the border region between israel and lebanon and stop the flow of arms .
but it has ruled out sending combat troops or police .
lebanon had also requested technical assistance from germany for its border police at frontier checkpoints and airports . liv n i accuses ira n of stalli n g for time livni also took the opportunity to voice israel 's concern over the " threat " posed by iran , saying the islamic state was trying to buy time to build a nuclear weapon and she surged world leaders monday to confront the islamic republic . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " she said .
" the world must understand that it must act so that uranium enrichment is stopped in iran .
this is crucial for world peace . " livni said the international community could not accept an equivocal iranian response to an incentives package for stopping sensitive nuclear work , calling it an attempt to stall until tehran can develop a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni honored holocaust victims at grunewald station and later in a speech before the german council on foreign relations , she demanded un sanctions against iran . " this is a test for the international community , " she said .
" it 's time for real sanctions . " livni also met with members of parliament monday and later laid a wreath at the grunewald train station from which the first berlin jews were sent to the nazi death camps .

only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .
but there has also been a noticeable change in israel 's basic position - namely the sudden willingness to be integrated in international solutions . who will se n d what , where a n d whe n ? this is certainly a positive development .
if only it were accompanied by a truly determined and demonstrative negotiations with the international community .
despite all the optimistic statements coming out of new york , this is exactly what has been missing . even with new pledges of additional troops to beef up the 2,000-man un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- with 3,500 additional soldiers , it is still unclear which countries will be sending troops where and when .
still , at the beginning of the fragile ceasefire put in place two weeks ago , even the first steps to build unifil up seemed far away . however , there are still more undecided than decided .
the troops ' exact mandate has not been established , and most of the countries - including germany - would rather send their navies to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .
beirut , which believes unifil should help the lebanese army on the ground in the country 's south instead of turning into a maritime force off the lebanese coast , is n't excited about the plan . leba n ese hold o n to sovereig n ty the lebanese government is not interested in giving up more sovereignty , which is why it insists on remaining responsible for the country 's eastern border with syria and cutting off arms smuggling there .
that is the reason why lebanese prime minister fuad siniora repeatedly said he is not considering a violent disarming of hezbollah , which runs the danger of provoking fights the army would not win . instead the prime minister wants the slow integration of hezbollah into the regular military .
hezbollah is not a foreign element but a part of lebanon .
but it can no longer be a state within a state and uncontrolled militia and needs to change and integrate itself into a political power . but this will not be achieved with military force - neither on the part of beirut nor from unifil .
expert political tactics are necessary and quick solutions are not to be expected .
that is why it is not absurd to plan the process - when it finally begins - not for weeks and months but for years .
that 's one more reason why most countries are not warming up to a substantial commitment in lebanon . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t -lrb- sms -rrb- . peter philipp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy prepares for troop deployment in lebanon prime minister romano prodi 's government was expected to clear the deployment of 2,500 italian troops for a un peacekeeping force in lebanon late on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.08.2006 ' ' weimar triangle " turns 15 without reason to celebrate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier days : schröder -lrb- germany -rrb- , chirac -lrb- france -rrb- and kwasniewksi -lrb- poland -rrb- in 1999 tuesday marks the 15th anniversary of the " weimar triangle , " an agreement which aimed to bring germany , france and poland closer together .
but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski is critical of the weimar triangle the majority of criticisms levelled at " weimar triangle " have taken place in private , but the group found itself in the headlines this year .
at the beginning of 2006 , newly-appointed polish president lech kaczynski provocatively questioned the sense and purpose of this special partnership , which he saw as not beneficial .
the current tension between germany and poland would have also played a role in putting the alliance under pressure .
for the anniversary summit , held in july with chancellor merkel and president chirac , kaczynski cancelled at the last minute - for health reasons .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers . " she also stressed the need for hezbollah to be disarmed , and added that " in my eyes , an organization that supports terror can not be part of a political system .
these organizations use democracy to spread their antidemocratic ideas . " a n arms embargo " by all mea n s n ecessary " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tzipi livni with frank-walter steinmeier these remarks echoed those made previously on monday when , directly after talks with steinmeier , livni said the beefed-up international force in southern lebanon must enforce an arms embargo against hezbollah " by all means necessary , " calling it the top priority in securing the fragile ceasefire . livni said that the conflict would certainly flare again if the shiite militia 's arms supply were not stopped . " the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .
" i believe that israel and germany share the same interest and the same view , as part of the international community , for the need of the application of the security council resolution , " she said before talks with chancellor angela merkel . merkel said that in addition to a contribution to the force , berlin would make a fresh effort to help restart to the middle east peace process between israel and the palestinians . " that is exactly what we are going to talk about , " the chancellor added before the meeting . germany has pledged to deploy a small naval unit to patrol the coastline of the border region between israel and lebanon and stop the flow of arms .
but it has ruled out sending combat troops or police .
lebanon had also requested technical assistance from germany for its border police at frontier checkpoints and airports . liv n i accuses ira n of stalli n g for time livni also took the opportunity to voice israel 's concern over the " threat " posed by iran , saying the islamic state was trying to buy time to build a nuclear weapon and she surged world leaders monday to confront the islamic republic . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " she said .
" the world must understand that it must act so that uranium enrichment is stopped in iran .
this is crucial for world peace . " livni said the international community could not accept an equivocal iranian response to an incentives package for stopping sensitive nuclear work , calling it an attempt to stall until tehran can develop a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni honored holocaust victims at grunewald station and later in a speech before the german council on foreign relations , she demanded un sanctions against iran . " this is a test for the international community , " she said .
" it 's time for real sanctions . " livni also met with members of parliament monday and later laid a wreath at the grunewald train station from which the first berlin jews were sent to the nazi death camps .

only in the case of failure , livni warned , would israel be forced to take matters into its own hands . behind the change of opinion lies , at least partially , a disenchantment in jerusalem , which did not deliver the war against hezbollah it had hoped for and promised its population .

if only it were accompanied by a truly determined and demonstrative negotiations with the international community .

still , at the beginning of the fragile ceasefire put in place two weeks ago , even the first steps to build unifil up seemed far away . however , there are still more undecided than decided .
the troops ' exact mandate has not been established , and most of the countries - including germany - would rather send their navies to patrol lebanon 's mediterranean coast .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .

we want the root of tensions to be removed .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

the center said it hoped the documents would give insight into the activities of the waffen ss , which was closely involved in the systematic killing of jews . efraim zuroff , director of the wiesenthal center , demanded in an open letter to grass that the 78-year-old writer provide further details concerning the documents in addition to what he wrote in his latest autobiographical book " beim häuten der zwiebel " -lrb- " peeling onions " -rrb- . wiesenthal center requests grass ' help " while access to the archives will certainly help facilitate historical research , documents alone can not give a complete picture of a person 's war service , " zuroff told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simon wiesenthal center describes its late namesake as a " freelance nazi hunter " in his letter , zuroff specifically requested that grass elaborate on any officers and enlisted men he could remember from his unit and exactly where and when he served . he called grass ' description in his recently published book of the events in 1945 " very thin , " according to reports . employees of the berlin archive holding grass ' military service documents released them to the press last thursday prior to obtaining the author 's permission , according to a netzeitung.de report .
on friday , grass formally gave the archive permission to make the files public . alexander dix , data protection commissioner for the state of berlin , called the premature disclosure illegal and unacceptable . doubts over the validity of grass ' book several german media organizations have suggested there were discrepancies between grass ' latest book " peeling onions , " currently no. 1 on the bestseller list in germany , and the contents of the newly released nazi documents . in particular , the date of his recruitment and the precise division he served in came under question .
light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers . " she also stressed the need for hezbollah to be disarmed , and added that " in my eyes , an organization that supports terror can not be part of a political system .
these organizations use democracy to spread their antidemocratic ideas . " a n arms embargo " by all mea n s n ecessary " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tzipi livni with frank-walter steinmeier these remarks echoed those made previously on monday when , directly after talks with steinmeier , livni said the beefed-up international force in southern lebanon must enforce an arms embargo against hezbollah " by all means necessary , " calling it the top priority in securing the fragile ceasefire . livni said that the conflict would certainly flare again if the shiite militia 's arms supply were not stopped . " the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .
" i believe that israel and germany share the same interest and the same view , as part of the international community , for the need of the application of the security council resolution , " she said before talks with chancellor angela merkel . merkel said that in addition to a contribution to the force , berlin would make a fresh effort to help restart to the middle east peace process between israel and the palestinians . " that is exactly what we are going to talk about , " the chancellor added before the meeting . germany has pledged to deploy a small naval unit to patrol the coastline of the border region between israel and lebanon and stop the flow of arms .
but it has ruled out sending combat troops or police .
lebanon had also requested technical assistance from germany for its border police at frontier checkpoints and airports . liv n i accuses ira n of stalli n g for time livni also took the opportunity to voice israel 's concern over the " threat " posed by iran , saying the islamic state was trying to buy time to build a nuclear weapon and she surged world leaders monday to confront the islamic republic . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " she said .
" the world must understand that it must act so that uranium enrichment is stopped in iran .
this is crucial for world peace . " livni said the international community could not accept an equivocal iranian response to an incentives package for stopping sensitive nuclear work , calling it an attempt to stall until tehran can develop a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni honored holocaust victims at grunewald station and later in a speech before the german council on foreign relations , she demanded un sanctions against iran . " this is a test for the international community , " she said .
" it 's time for real sanctions . " livni also met with members of parliament monday and later laid a wreath at the grunewald train station from which the first berlin jews were sent to the nazi death camps .

" the links between small and mid-sized companies have to be strengthened , " glos said , pointing out that india was also of immense interest as an outsourcing location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's michael glos ' first visit to india since being appointed economics minister last year glos ' visit comes amid reports of record-high growth in bilateral trade between india and germany .
german exports to india surged by 43.7 percent to 2.84 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.64 billion -rrb- in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period last year .
at the same time , indian exports to india rose by 32.8 percent to 2.13 billion euros . glos said his visit was meant to contribute to breaking the psychological mark of 10 billion euros in bilateral trade - an ambitious goal set by former german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to delhi two years ago . " i 'm really optimistic that this meeting today will be a milestone towards that , " said glos , who met with indian trade minister kamal nath . german interest in india growing glos ' visit to delhi , his first since being appointed economics minister last year , was meant to focus renewed attention on india and help to further break down barriers to bilateral trade and business . though german giants such as siemens , bosch and bayer can boast of a long business presence and tradition in india , other firms have hesitated in making the leap .
while the us , south korea or japan have all moved into india early , experts have long bemoaned that germany has been too slow in gaining a foothold in the market there . at the same time , there 's no denying that india , with its booming economy and growing middle class , has become increasingly important for the german economy in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel met with indian prime minister manmohan singh at the hanover fair in april experts point out that german interest in india has increased further still since the hanover industrial fair in april where the spotlight was on india .
indian companies , too , are spreading their wings and eyeing investments in germany , particularly in the field of pharmaceuticals . investments still lagging at the same time , many say the robust growth in bilateral trade is n't reflected in the field of investments . dietrich kebschull , chairman of the indo-german export promotion council told german public broadcaster ndr that india still suffered from a bad image , which he said explained the wariness on the part of german mid-sized companies . " they 're much too skeptical , too hesitant , particularly when you compare it with other countries like china , which i think germans are too uncritical of , " kebschull said .
" on the other hand , people have too many reservations about india . " infrastructure tops the list of foreign investors complaints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is plagued by near-daily power failures and shortages " infrastructure is the biggest problem in india and at the same time offers huge chances , " andreas flach from corporate consultancy ernst & young told ndr .
" investments in streets , bridges , ports , airports as well as the energy sector are estimated to reach more than 150 billion euros in the next six to seven years . " other woes hobbling india 's economic rise include excessive bureaucracy , high custom duties and taxes . more chances than risks experts , however , remain confident that , given india 's yearly growth rates of 8 percent and possibly more , the country in the long run holds more golden opportunities than risks for germany . " the indian economy has developed positively and in a stable manner over the past years and there 's enormous enthusiasm in the country .
i 'm convinced that we 'll have a completely different picture in the next five to 10 years , " said flach . that message seems to have reached some germans investors . on tuesday , european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , which is part of glos ' business delegation , said it planned to invest up to 2 billion euros in india in the next 15 years . " india is in the process of becoming an important player in the aviation industry , " eads ' co-head thomas enders said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market .

a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

at the beginning of 2006 , newly-appointed polish president lech kaczynski provocatively questioned the sense and purpose of this special partnership , which he saw as not beneficial .
the current tension between germany and poland would have also played a role in putting the alliance under pressure .
for the anniversary summit , held in july with chancellor merkel and president chirac , kaczynski cancelled at the last minute - for health reasons .

" the debate should be uncensored in order for the american people to be able to listen to what we say and they should not restrict the american people from hearing the truth .

iran wanted the root of tensions in the middle east to be " removed , " he said , in a comment harking back to statement made last year in which he referred to israel as a tumor . " our position on the middle east is clear .
we want the root of tensions to be removed .

" the links between small and mid-sized companies have to be strengthened , " glos said , pointing out that india was also of immense interest as an outsourcing location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's michael glos ' first visit to india since being appointed economics minister last year glos ' visit comes amid reports of record-high growth in bilateral trade between india and germany .
german exports to india surged by 43.7 percent to 2.84 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.64 billion -rrb- in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period last year .
at the same time , indian exports to india rose by 32.8 percent to 2.13 billion euros . glos said his visit was meant to contribute to breaking the psychological mark of 10 billion euros in bilateral trade - an ambitious goal set by former german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to delhi two years ago . " i 'm really optimistic that this meeting today will be a milestone towards that , " said glos , who met with indian trade minister kamal nath . german interest in india growing glos ' visit to delhi , his first since being appointed economics minister last year , was meant to focus renewed attention on india and help to further break down barriers to bilateral trade and business . though german giants such as siemens , bosch and bayer can boast of a long business presence and tradition in india , other firms have hesitated in making the leap .
while the us , south korea or japan have all moved into india early , experts have long bemoaned that germany has been too slow in gaining a foothold in the market there . at the same time , there 's no denying that india , with its booming economy and growing middle class , has become increasingly important for the german economy in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel met with indian prime minister manmohan singh at the hanover fair in april experts point out that german interest in india has increased further still since the hanover industrial fair in april where the spotlight was on india .
indian companies , too , are spreading their wings and eyeing investments in germany , particularly in the field of pharmaceuticals . investments still lagging at the same time , many say the robust growth in bilateral trade is n't reflected in the field of investments . dietrich kebschull , chairman of the indo-german export promotion council told german public broadcaster ndr that india still suffered from a bad image , which he said explained the wariness on the part of german mid-sized companies . " they 're much too skeptical , too hesitant , particularly when you compare it with other countries like china , which i think germans are too uncritical of , " kebschull said .

" the links between small and mid-sized companies have to be strengthened , " glos said , pointing out that india was also of immense interest as an outsourcing location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's michael glos ' first visit to india since being appointed economics minister last year glos ' visit comes amid reports of record-high growth in bilateral trade between india and germany .
german exports to india surged by 43.7 percent to 2.84 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.64 billion -rrb- in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period last year .
at the same time , indian exports to india rose by 32.8 percent to 2.13 billion euros . glos said his visit was meant to contribute to breaking the psychological mark of 10 billion euros in bilateral trade - an ambitious goal set by former german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to delhi two years ago .

while the us , south korea or japan have all moved into india early , experts have long bemoaned that germany has been too slow in gaining a foothold in the market there . at the same time , there 's no denying that india , with its booming economy and growing middle class , has become increasingly important for the german economy in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel met with indian prime minister manmohan singh at the hanover fair in april experts point out that german interest in india has increased further still since the hanover industrial fair in april where the spotlight was on india .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski is critical of the weimar triangle the majority of criticisms levelled at " weimar triangle " have taken place in private , but the group found itself in the headlines this year .
at the beginning of 2006 , newly-appointed polish president lech kaczynski provocatively questioned the sense and purpose of this special partnership , which he saw as not beneficial .
the current tension between germany and poland would have also played a role in putting the alliance under pressure .
for the anniversary summit , held in july with chancellor merkel and president chirac , kaczynski cancelled at the last minute - for health reasons .

" the links between small and mid-sized companies have to be strengthened , " glos said , pointing out that india was also of immense interest as an outsourcing location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's michael glos ' first visit to india since being appointed economics minister last year glos ' visit comes amid reports of record-high growth in bilateral trade between india and germany .
german exports to india surged by 43.7 percent to 2.84 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.64 billion -rrb- in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period last year .
at the same time , indian exports to india rose by 32.8 percent to 2.13 billion euros . glos said his visit was meant to contribute to breaking the psychological mark of 10 billion euros in bilateral trade - an ambitious goal set by former german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to delhi two years ago . " i 'm really optimistic that this meeting today will be a milestone towards that , " said glos , who met with indian trade minister kamal nath . german interest in india growing glos ' visit to delhi , his first since being appointed economics minister last year , was meant to focus renewed attention on india and help to further break down barriers to bilateral trade and business . though german giants such as siemens , bosch and bayer can boast of a long business presence and tradition in india , other firms have hesitated in making the leap .
while the us , south korea or japan have all moved into india early , experts have long bemoaned that germany has been too slow in gaining a foothold in the market there . at the same time , there 's no denying that india , with its booming economy and growing middle class , has become increasingly important for the german economy in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel met with indian prime minister manmohan singh at the hanover fair in april experts point out that german interest in india has increased further still since the hanover industrial fair in april where the spotlight was on india .
indian companies , too , are spreading their wings and eyeing investments in germany , particularly in the field of pharmaceuticals . investments still lagging at the same time , many say the robust growth in bilateral trade is n't reflected in the field of investments . dietrich kebschull , chairman of the indo-german export promotion council told german public broadcaster ndr that india still suffered from a bad image , which he said explained the wariness on the part of german mid-sized companies . " they 're much too skeptical , too hesitant , particularly when you compare it with other countries like china , which i think germans are too uncritical of , " kebschull said .
" on the other hand , people have too many reservations about india . " infrastructure tops the list of foreign investors complaints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is plagued by near-daily power failures and shortages " infrastructure is the biggest problem in india and at the same time offers huge chances , " andreas flach from corporate consultancy ernst & young told ndr .
" investments in streets , bridges , ports , airports as well as the energy sector are estimated to reach more than 150 billion euros in the next six to seven years . " other woes hobbling india 's economic rise include excessive bureaucracy , high custom duties and taxes . more chances than risks experts , however , remain confident that , given india 's yearly growth rates of 8 percent and possibly more , the country in the long run holds more golden opportunities than risks for germany . " the indian economy has developed positively and in a stable manner over the past years and there 's enormous enthusiasm in the country .
i 'm convinced that we 'll have a completely different picture in the next five to 10 years , " said flach . that message seems to have reached some germans investors . on tuesday , european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , which is part of glos ' business delegation , said it planned to invest up to 2 billion euros in india in the next 15 years . " india is in the process of becoming an important player in the aviation industry , " eads ' co-head thomas enders said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market .

iran has insisted it has no intention of abandoning such work and faces the threat of un sanctions should it fail to comply . iran response to package " exceptional " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear program carries on at pace " i think that the opportunity that iran has given the europeans is extremely exceptional for fairly resolving all issues .
of course , that is if they are interested in justice and i hope they will be , " said ahmadinejad . iran had laid out a framework for talks in its reply to an offer by the five permanent security council members plus germany of incentives in exchange for a suspension of enrichment . asked specifically if iran would halt enrichment , even for a short period , ahmadinejad replied : " in that -lrb- iran 's response to the six-nation offer -rrb- , we announced that any kind of dialogue should be based upon the certain rights of the iranian nation . " the iranian president also took the opportunity to chide the americans and british for what he said was extreme arrogance on their part since the end of world war ii .
" we think the special privileges that america and britain are taking advantage of today are the origin of all disturbances in the world . " " is n't it time that international relations are founded on democracy and equal rights of the nations ? " he asked . president calls for tv debate with bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is unlikely to debate with ahmadinejad the iranian president then challenged us president george w. bush to an american-style tv duel in which the two leaders would debate the problems of the world . " i suggest holding a live tv debate with mr. george w. bush to talk about world affairs and the ways to solve those issues , " he said . " the debate should be uncensored in order for the american people to be able to listen to what we say and they should not restrict the american people from hearing the truth . " ahmadinejad then turned his attention to another of iran 's foes : israel .
iran wanted the root of tensions in the middle east to be " removed , " he said , in a comment harking back to statement made last year in which he referred to israel as a tumor . " our position on the middle east is clear .
we want the root of tensions to be removed .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers . " she also stressed the need for hezbollah to be disarmed , and added that " in my eyes , an organization that supports terror can not be part of a political system .
these organizations use democracy to spread their antidemocratic ideas . " a n arms embargo " by all mea n s n ecessary " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tzipi livni with frank-walter steinmeier these remarks echoed those made previously on monday when , directly after talks with steinmeier , livni said the beefed-up international force in southern lebanon must enforce an arms embargo against hezbollah " by all means necessary , " calling it the top priority in securing the fragile ceasefire . livni said that the conflict would certainly flare again if the shiite militia 's arms supply were not stopped . " the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .
" i believe that israel and germany share the same interest and the same view , as part of the international community , for the need of the application of the security council resolution , " she said before talks with chancellor angela merkel . merkel said that in addition to a contribution to the force , berlin would make a fresh effort to help restart to the middle east peace process between israel and the palestinians . " that is exactly what we are going to talk about , " the chancellor added before the meeting . germany has pledged to deploy a small naval unit to patrol the coastline of the border region between israel and lebanon and stop the flow of arms .
but it has ruled out sending combat troops or police .
lebanon had also requested technical assistance from germany for its border police at frontier checkpoints and airports . liv n i accuses ira n of stalli n g for time livni also took the opportunity to voice israel 's concern over the " threat " posed by iran , saying the islamic state was trying to buy time to build a nuclear weapon and she surged world leaders monday to confront the islamic republic . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " she said .
" the world must understand that it must act so that uranium enrichment is stopped in iran .
this is crucial for world peace . " livni said the international community could not accept an equivocal iranian response to an incentives package for stopping sensitive nuclear work , calling it an attempt to stall until tehran can develop a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni honored holocaust victims at grunewald station and later in a speech before the german council on foreign relations , she demanded un sanctions against iran . " this is a test for the international community , " she said .

while the us , south korea or japan have all moved into india early , experts have long bemoaned that germany has been too slow in gaining a foothold in the market there . at the same time , there 's no denying that india , with its booming economy and growing middle class , has become increasingly important for the german economy in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel met with indian prime minister manmohan singh at the hanover fair in april experts point out that german interest in india has increased further still since the hanover industrial fair in april where the spotlight was on india .
indian companies , too , are spreading their wings and eyeing investments in germany , particularly in the field of pharmaceuticals . investments still lagging at the same time , many say the robust growth in bilateral trade is n't reflected in the field of investments . dietrich kebschull , chairman of the indo-german export promotion council told german public broadcaster ndr that india still suffered from a bad image , which he said explained the wariness on the part of german mid-sized companies . " they 're much too skeptical , too hesitant , particularly when you compare it with other countries like china , which i think germans are too uncritical of , " kebschull said .
" on the other hand , people have too many reservations about india . " infrastructure tops the list of foreign investors complaints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is plagued by near-daily power failures and shortages " infrastructure is the biggest problem in india and at the same time offers huge chances , " andreas flach from corporate consultancy ernst & young told ndr .
" investments in streets , bridges , ports , airports as well as the energy sector are estimated to reach more than 150 billion euros in the next six to seven years . " other woes hobbling india 's economic rise include excessive bureaucracy , high custom duties and taxes . more chances than risks experts , however , remain confident that , given india 's yearly growth rates of 8 percent and possibly more , the country in the long run holds more golden opportunities than risks for germany . " the indian economy has developed positively and in a stable manner over the past years and there 's enormous enthusiasm in the country .
i 'm convinced that we 'll have a completely different picture in the next five to 10 years , " said flach . that message seems to have reached some germans investors . on tuesday , european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , which is part of glos ' business delegation , said it planned to invest up to 2 billion euros in india in the next 15 years . " india is in the process of becoming an important player in the aviation industry , " eads ' co-head thomas enders said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

at the beginning of 2006 , newly-appointed polish president lech kaczynski provocatively questioned the sense and purpose of this special partnership , which he saw as not beneficial .
the current tension between germany and poland would have also played a role in putting the alliance under pressure .
for the anniversary summit , held in july with chancellor merkel and president chirac , kaczynski cancelled at the last minute - for health reasons .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers . " she also stressed the need for hezbollah to be disarmed , and added that " in my eyes , an organization that supports terror can not be part of a political system .
these organizations use democracy to spread their antidemocratic ideas . " a n arms embargo " by all mea n s n ecessary " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tzipi livni with frank-walter steinmeier these remarks echoed those made previously on monday when , directly after talks with steinmeier , livni said the beefed-up international force in southern lebanon must enforce an arms embargo against hezbollah " by all means necessary , " calling it the top priority in securing the fragile ceasefire . livni said that the conflict would certainly flare again if the shiite militia 's arms supply were not stopped . " the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .
" i believe that israel and germany share the same interest and the same view , as part of the international community , for the need of the application of the security council resolution , " she said before talks with chancellor angela merkel . merkel said that in addition to a contribution to the force , berlin would make a fresh effort to help restart to the middle east peace process between israel and the palestinians . " that is exactly what we are going to talk about , " the chancellor added before the meeting . germany has pledged to deploy a small naval unit to patrol the coastline of the border region between israel and lebanon and stop the flow of arms .
but it has ruled out sending combat troops or police .

" the world must understand that it must act so that uranium enrichment is stopped in iran .

the " prize " piece is a 400-kilo -lrb- 880-lb . -rrb- bronze eagle atop a swastika . a private syndicate wants to put fragments of the " graf spee " battleship up for auction and share the proceeds with the government , as required by law , the new york times reported .
but uruguayan officials are concerned that neo-nazis could acquire the artifacts and have threatened to suspend the group 's permit and do the salvaging themselves . " there are ethical limits on the promotion of nazi symbols in museums , so who are the potential buyers of these icons if not neo-nazis , " miguel esmoris , head of the government 's national heritage commission , told the paper .
" we 're not against salvagers making a profit , but this is formally an archeological site , and we can not allow illicit trafficking in cultural and historical items . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graf spee was crippled by british warships and sunk by its captain on dec .
13 , 1939 the group has been trying to salvage parts of the ship since 2004 .
that year they recovered a cannon and a communications tower , finds that failed to attract half as much attention as the bronze eagle and swastika that were brought to shore in february .
the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german technological innovation at the beginning of world war ii .
it was crippled by british warships in 1939 in one of the first naval exchanges of the war .
it was subsequently sunk by its captain outside of montevideo harbor .
interest from neo-nazis alfredo etchegaray , head of the syndicate , said collectors from the united states and asia were willing to pay $ 15 million -lrb- 12 million euro -rrb- if the fragments go to auction , according to the report .
marine archeologist roberto branco , who works in the region , told the paper he had received e-mail messages from colleagues in europe who were keen on buying the eagle and swastika . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the salvaged cannon was installed at the naval museum in montevideo etchegaray said that potential buyers would be carefully screened . but ernesto kreimermann , president of the uruguayan jewish committee , was critical of the idea of selling the fragments privately .
" when it comes time to commercialize the insignia , we believe it must go in a museum , not into private hands , and that photographs be controlled , " he told the paper .
germany to claim ownership ?
germany may also claim ownership of the wreck , further endangering the syndicate 's project , which etchegaray said had already cost it $ 100,000 .
a german embassy official in montevideo , theodor proffe , reportedly said his government had laid out its position in a note to the uruguayan foreign ministry , but he refused to explain the official position .
the previous german government had apparently protested against the graf spee being raised and declared the ship its own property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communications tower was recovered in feb .
2004 etchegaray , meanwhile , disputed that germany had any claim to the vessel , saying that it had sold the rights to salvage the ship to a uruguayan businessman in 1940 . " we 're interested in this as pure history , and not in taking one side or another , " etchegaray told the new york times .

the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .

the center said it hoped the documents would give insight into the activities of the waffen ss , which was closely involved in the systematic killing of jews . efraim zuroff , director of the wiesenthal center , demanded in an open letter to grass that the 78-year-old writer provide further details concerning the documents in addition to what he wrote in his latest autobiographical book " beim häuten der zwiebel " -lrb- " peeling onions " -rrb- . wiesenthal center requests grass ' help " while access to the archives will certainly help facilitate historical research , documents alone can not give a complete picture of a person 's war service , " zuroff told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simon wiesenthal center describes its late namesake as a " freelance nazi hunter " in his letter , zuroff specifically requested that grass elaborate on any officers and enlisted men he could remember from his unit and exactly where and when he served . he called grass ' description in his recently published book of the events in 1945 " very thin , " according to reports . employees of the berlin archive holding grass ' military service documents released them to the press last thursday prior to obtaining the author 's permission , according to a netzeitung.de report .
on friday , grass formally gave the archive permission to make the files public . alexander dix , data protection commissioner for the state of berlin , called the premature disclosure illegal and unacceptable . doubts over the validity of grass ' book several german media organizations have suggested there were discrepancies between grass ' latest book " peeling onions , " currently no. 1 on the bestseller list in germany , and the contents of the newly released nazi documents . in particular , the date of his recruitment and the precise division he served in came under question .
light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .
his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned .
-lrb- aug .
17 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

15 , 2006 -rrb- nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

the center said it hoped the documents would give insight into the activities of the waffen ss , which was closely involved in the systematic killing of jews . efraim zuroff , director of the wiesenthal center , demanded in an open letter to grass that the 78-year-old writer provide further details concerning the documents in addition to what he wrote in his latest autobiographical book " beim häuten der zwiebel " -lrb- " peeling onions " -rrb- . wiesenthal center requests grass ' help " while access to the archives will certainly help facilitate historical research , documents alone can not give a complete picture of a person 's war service , " zuroff told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.08.2006 german minister in india to drive forward bilateral business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is lured by india 's economic charms , including its skilled workforce german economics minister glos is in india for the first time to further bolster bilateral business and trade which finally show signs of gathering speed . armed with a high-profile delegation and backed by a list of glowing statistics testifying to booming bilateral trade , german economics minister michael glos on tuesday drummed up support for deeper cooperation between mid-sized german companies and their indian counterparts in delhi . " the links between small and mid-sized companies have to be strengthened , " glos said , pointing out that india was also of immense interest as an outsourcing location . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's michael glos ' first visit to india since being appointed economics minister last year glos ' visit comes amid reports of record-high growth in bilateral trade between india and germany .
german exports to india surged by 43.7 percent to 2.84 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.64 billion -rrb- in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period last year .
at the same time , indian exports to india rose by 32.8 percent to 2.13 billion euros . glos said his visit was meant to contribute to breaking the psychological mark of 10 billion euros in bilateral trade - an ambitious goal set by former german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to delhi two years ago . " i 'm really optimistic that this meeting today will be a milestone towards that , " said glos , who met with indian trade minister kamal nath . german interest in india growing glos ' visit to delhi , his first since being appointed economics minister last year , was meant to focus renewed attention on india and help to further break down barriers to bilateral trade and business . though german giants such as siemens , bosch and bayer can boast of a long business presence and tradition in india , other firms have hesitated in making the leap .
while the us , south korea or japan have all moved into india early , experts have long bemoaned that germany has been too slow in gaining a foothold in the market there . at the same time , there 's no denying that india , with its booming economy and growing middle class , has become increasingly important for the german economy in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel met with indian prime minister manmohan singh at the hanover fair in april experts point out that german interest in india has increased further still since the hanover industrial fair in april where the spotlight was on india .
indian companies , too , are spreading their wings and eyeing investments in germany , particularly in the field of pharmaceuticals . investments still lagging at the same time , many say the robust growth in bilateral trade is n't reflected in the field of investments . dietrich kebschull , chairman of the indo-german export promotion council told german public broadcaster ndr that india still suffered from a bad image , which he said explained the wariness on the part of german mid-sized companies . " they 're much too skeptical , too hesitant , particularly when you compare it with other countries like china , which i think germans are too uncritical of , " kebschull said .
" on the other hand , people have too many reservations about india . " infrastructure tops the list of foreign investors complaints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is plagued by near-daily power failures and shortages " infrastructure is the biggest problem in india and at the same time offers huge chances , " andreas flach from corporate consultancy ernst & young told ndr .
" investments in streets , bridges , ports , airports as well as the energy sector are estimated to reach more than 150 billion euros in the next six to seven years . " other woes hobbling india 's economic rise include excessive bureaucracy , high custom duties and taxes . more chances than risks experts , however , remain confident that , given india 's yearly growth rates of 8 percent and possibly more , the country in the long run holds more golden opportunities than risks for germany . " the indian economy has developed positively and in a stable manner over the past years and there 's enormous enthusiasm in the country .
i 'm convinced that we 'll have a completely different picture in the next five to 10 years , " said flach . that message seems to have reached some germans investors . on tuesday , european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , which is part of glos ' business delegation , said it planned to invest up to 2 billion euros in india in the next 15 years . " india is in the process of becoming an important player in the aviation industry , " eads ' co-head thomas enders said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market .
-lrb- april 22 , 2006 -rrb- " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

14 . " the demand in the un security council was for an immediate , unconditional release of the soldiers , and those are our expectations too , " livni said , referring to the un resolution that ended the fighting .
" at the moment , we expect from everyone , naturally including germany , that they turn to lebanese prime minister -lrb- fuad -rrb- saniora and call on him to take responsibility and take care of freeing the kidnapped soldiers . " she also stressed the need for hezbollah to be disarmed , and added that " in my eyes , an organization that supports terror can not be part of a political system .
these organizations use democracy to spread their antidemocratic ideas . " a n arms embargo " by all mea n s n ecessary " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tzipi livni with frank-walter steinmeier these remarks echoed those made previously on monday when , directly after talks with steinmeier , livni said the beefed-up international force in southern lebanon must enforce an arms embargo against hezbollah " by all means necessary , " calling it the top priority in securing the fragile ceasefire . livni said that the conflict would certainly flare again if the shiite militia 's arms supply were not stopped . " the arms embargo is the most important thing , " she said .
" i know that those who believe in a better future -lrb- for -rrb- the region do n't want to come back to the situation that we faced in the last years since israel withdrew from lebanon . "
she added that hezbollah had used the six-year period to rearm with the help of iran and syria . steinmeier said he was confident that the rules of engagement for the international force which would enforce the peace could be hammered out this week and expected " decisive steps forward " at a conference for nations contributing troops monday in new york . press reports over the weekend said germany could send about 1,200 military personnel but steinmeier declined to comment on the figure . european union states have pledged almost 7,000 troops , nearly half the number needed to bring the un interim force in lebanon to the 15,000 envisaged under un security council resolution 1701 that paved the way for the two-week-old ceasefire . israel cou n ti n g o n germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel wants germany 's help , livni said livni said later that israel was counting on germany to contribute to a robust international buffer force to police the ceasefire .
" i believe that israel and germany share the same interest and the same view , as part of the international community , for the need of the application of the security council resolution , " she said before talks with chancellor angela merkel . merkel said that in addition to a contribution to the force , berlin would make a fresh effort to help restart to the middle east peace process between israel and the palestinians . " that is exactly what we are going to talk about , " the chancellor added before the meeting . germany has pledged to deploy a small naval unit to patrol the coastline of the border region between israel and lebanon and stop the flow of arms .
but it has ruled out sending combat troops or police .
lebanon had also requested technical assistance from germany for its border police at frontier checkpoints and airports . liv n i accuses ira n of stalli n g for time livni also took the opportunity to voice israel 's concern over the " threat " posed by iran , saying the islamic state was trying to buy time to build a nuclear weapon and she surged world leaders monday to confront the islamic republic . " there is an additional threat , not just for the state of israel but for the entire international community , " she said .
" the world must understand that it must act so that uranium enrichment is stopped in iran .
this is crucial for world peace . " livni said the international community could not accept an equivocal iranian response to an incentives package for stopping sensitive nuclear work , calling it an attempt to stall until tehran can develop a nuclear weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni honored holocaust victims at grunewald station and later in a speech before the german council on foreign relations , she demanded un sanctions against iran . " this is a test for the international community , " she said .
" it 's time for real sanctions . " livni also met with members of parliament monday and later laid a wreath at the grunewald train station from which the first berlin jews were sent to the nazi death camps .

ever wonder what a mole has to say ?
did you know that birds sing in dialect ?
the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .
" the best way is to sit and wait , and wait , and wait .
you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !
the unique archive is housed in berlin , but the recordings have become globe-trotters .
audio-installations in museums and zoological gardens around the world make use of them , and rare animal voices can be heard in the digital edition of germany 's well-known brockhaus encyclopedia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermit always had a lot more to say than " riiiibit " what 's more , the voices of six endangered species can even be downloaded as mobile phone ring tones as part of an unusual environmental protection campaign called " nature is calling , " which is sponsored by the german government . the archive also combines nature with technology and makes use of the internet to complete research in bioacoustics . researchers from the humboldt university animal sound archive have teamed up with computer science experts from bonn university to investigate noise pollution . " in germany you can hardly find a place without noise pollution , " frommolt said .
" i believe that this noise pollution could be a problem for the animals and i 'm hoping the world will change .

the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy .

after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !
the unique archive is housed in berlin , but the recordings have become globe-trotters .

the center said it hoped the documents would give insight into the activities of the waffen ss , which was closely involved in the systematic killing of jews . efraim zuroff , director of the wiesenthal center , demanded in an open letter to grass that the 78-year-old writer provide further details concerning the documents in addition to what he wrote in his latest autobiographical book " beim häuten der zwiebel " -lrb- " peeling onions " -rrb- . wiesenthal center requests grass ' help " while access to the archives will certainly help facilitate historical research , documents alone can not give a complete picture of a person 's war service , " zuroff told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simon wiesenthal center describes its late namesake as a " freelance nazi hunter " in his letter , zuroff specifically requested that grass elaborate on any officers and enlisted men he could remember from his unit and exactly where and when he served . he called grass ' description in his recently published book of the events in 1945 " very thin , " according to reports . employees of the berlin archive holding grass ' military service documents released them to the press last thursday prior to obtaining the author 's permission , according to a netzeitung.de report .
on friday , grass formally gave the archive permission to make the files public . alexander dix , data protection commissioner for the state of berlin , called the premature disclosure illegal and unacceptable . doubts over the validity of grass ' book several german media organizations have suggested there were discrepancies between grass ' latest book " peeling onions , " currently no. 1 on the bestseller list in germany , and the contents of the newly released nazi documents . in particular , the date of his recruitment and the precise division he served in came under question .
light was shed on the circumstances surrounding his injury , however , which the writer himself had said he could only vaguely remember . according to the archived documents , grass was injured on april 20 , 1945 .
five days after the german army surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in auerbach , one of the largest such camps for ss soldiers . in mid-august , grass sparked controversy by publicly admitting his membership in the elite nazi corps toward the end of world war ii . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass defends long silence as book sales soar german writer günter grass again defended his long silence on his service in adolf hitler 's waffen ss in a televised interview .
his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .
o n goi n g disagreeme n ts the collaboration between the three countries soon benefited warsaw , with germany and france pushing for poland to be admitted into nato and later into the european union .
but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

but despite the good intentions , conflicts between these nations still remain . on aug .
28 1991 , the foreign ministers from germany , france and poland met for a joint session in the german city of weimar to strengthen political ties between these countries and promote european integration .
to mark the 15th anniversary of that event on tuesday , former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and his french and polish counterparts , roland dumas and krzystof skubiszewski respectively , will be honored with an award .
but as recent events have proven , the " weimar triangle " has not developed as well as its founding fathers might have hoped .
stre n gthe n i n g eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weimar triangle helped secure acession to the eu for poland when genscher initiated the ' ' weimar triangle " in 1991 , he wanted to extend the close partnership between germany and france to include neighbouring poland .
with the intention to strengthen european unity , it was hoped that a close alliance with poland would set the precedent to expand the european union to the eastern nations .
what was initially envisaged as an annual meeting of foreign ministers was quickly expanded and today includes a combination of ministers from different departments along with state and government leaders .
the goal was to have the three nations , who have fought each other repeatedly in the past , working together to strengthen ties .
political efforts have included joint economic and cultural projects , for example german , french and polish youth organizations working together .

but even before poland 's admission to the eu was ratified , the motivation to sustain the " weimar triangle " began to diminish .
the regular meetings of the heads of state were increasingly criticized as being ineffectual .
disagreements on joint projects between the three nations were rarely resolved : for example france and germany opposed the iraq war , while poland , committed soldiers in the us-led invasion .
the three countries were also unable to agree on delicate financial matters regarding the eu .
the difficulties arose from the significant inequalities between the states , with germany and france among the leading nations in europe while the equally self-assured poland was , and still is today , forced to take a backseat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.08.2006 german automakers and suppliers still in the driver 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production in germany remains internationally competitive although its high hourly wage structure has led automakers to outsource production in eastern europe and china , germany has still maintained its international competitiveness in premium markets . only a few years ago , the death knell was sounded for automotive suppliers and manufacturers in germany , with reports of downsizing and production being shifted abroad to emerging eastern european countries and china , where labor costs are considerably lower than in the west .
but now those forecasts of doom appear to be premature and unjustified . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive , but highly trained workers are important " the strong pressure to cut costs then led to a narrow minded focus on high labor costs here , but that view has widened considerably , " said jan miller , a spokesman for ernst & young business consultants , who conducted a recent industry survey .
" other factors , such as our highly qualified workforce and innovative edge , are equally important .
what has changed is the image of germany as a production site .
the hourly cost of hiring an industrial worker in the western part of germany is the third highest in the world at 28 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , compared to 19 euros in the us and only 4 euros in slovakia and poland , according to the cologne institute for economic research . high labor costs , but u n rivalled germa n i n frastructure " such high costs to the employer are a major drawback in germany , but the tightly woven net of suppliers , services and high tech research , which supports the industrial core is unrivalled here , " said martin leutz , spokesman for gesamtmetall , an employer 's association in the metal and electrical sector which represents the big players such as siemens , daimler-chrysler and bmw , as well as mid-sized and small companies .
" this kind of cluster structure , which allows for depth , diversity , streamlined efficiency and quick decision making , is hard to duplicate in other countries . " outsourcing of low-skilled , labor intensive work to countries such as poland , slovakia and the czech republic actually allows german companies to concentrate on maintaining a leading technological edge in world markets and producing premium products , leutz added . o n ly o n e major assembly pla n t outside germa n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : final assembly of a mercedes roadster in the port city of bremen " the manufacturing base in germany has always been incredibly strong .
our main industrial imprint is home-based , " said florian martens , spokesman for the flagship mercedes division of daimler-chrysler , who added that the assembly plant in alabama is the only major one outside of germany .
" all our engines for example are made in germany , even those for suvs in the us market .
in the us though , it made sense to set up production facilities as a hedge against currency fluctuations , and to be close to our primary customers . " although eastern europe and china are ranked high among auto suppliers as production sites , germany comes close behind with 72 percent of those surveyed finding the home market attractive , according to the ernst & young survey . " the gospel that we have been preaching for years is to remain home-based , " said christoph stürmer , an auto analyst at global insight , a forecasting institute in frankfurt .
" even an equally qualified automotive engineer in china for example does not necessarily cost less than a german one . " productio n problems i n remote , developi n g cou n tries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky business in china stürmer added that plenty of western automobile manufacturers have discovered that the cost of quality control in countries such as india and china is too high , which has wound up wrecking their business model . " in developing countries , it is much harder to find highly qualified engineers who can perform complex tasks or plan strategically , " he said .
" transport and logistic costs also makes it risky to go to extreme locations , which is why eastern europe , which is geographically and culturally closer , is looked on more favorably . " although it is evident that automotive investments streams are increasingly headed eastwards , automakers still remain committed to their western european manufacturing base , " he said , adding that production in eastern europe is focused on the lower segment of mass-market vehicles , and is likely to stabilize at a level of 25 percent of total european output in the foreseeable future . and production in the premium market would remain primarily german . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating the damage of high labor costs for german business a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .

ever wonder what a mole has to say ?
did you know that birds sing in dialect ?
the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .
" the best way is to sit and wait , and wait , and wait .
you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .

ever wonder what a mole has to say ?
did you know that birds sing in dialect ?
the animal sound archive in berlin has recorded 110,000 animal voices .
some are even available as ring tones . günter tembrock , a young scientist at the zoological institute only wanted to try out a new tape-recorder when he took his microphone to a berlin garden on oct .
30 , 1951 .
there he captured the voice of a wild tawny owl as it " chatted " with two caged birds inside his office . that was the start of the animal sound archive , a scientific documentation of animal voices as an expression of their behavior .
the collection soon expanded when tembrock worked together with assistants and students to record more animals at berlin 's two zoological gardens and later in the wild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording the animals takes a lot of patience today , the animal sound archive at humboldt university in berlin is , with 110,000 samples , one of the oldest and largest collections of animal sounds in the world .
it contains 1,800 species of birds , the world 's largest collection of mammal-sounds , 150 species of arthropods , and various fish , amphibian and reptilian species . it even has the only recording ever made of a mole . getti n g a feeli n g for the a n imals two thirds of the recordings were made in captivity and one third in the wild in central and eastern europe , the caucasus , central asia , africa , central america and the antarctic . the archive 's director , karl-heinz frommolt , said recording wild animals is never easy . " i have no tricks , " he said .
" the best way is to sit and wait , and wait , and wait .
you have to develop a feeling for the animals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll never know what dodo would have said after studying one particular species for a long time , some experts get a feeling for when the animal might begin to vocalize , added the archive director . a biologist himself , frommolt specializes in wolves .
after waiting for several wolves to appear , he would turn on his recorder and start talking with them . " it 's a great feeling when you howl and the animals answer you , " frommolt said .
a n imal dialects in berlin , animal voices are used to research animal behavior .
why , for example , do birds sing ?
" birds mainly sing for two reasons , " said frommolt , adding that animals can distinguish each other by their voices .
" they could be giving a territorial signal , or trying to attract a female .
in most songbird species , only the males sing . " birds often sing in " dialects , " the biologist said , adding that they learn the various song structures from their parents and neighbors and - since they are territorial - they tend to return to the place where they were hatched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baby birds mimic their parents ' song , said the archive director geographical variations can be heard in the calls of other species as well , like the red deer . " the wapiti in north america , which is a sub-species of the red deer , whistles , " he said .
" but no englishman would say that a red deer whistles .
he would say that they roar , and if you listen to the sound , you will know why . " your pho n e is squawki n g !

the national consumer council believes it should be mandatory for businesses to warn people if sensitive personal information is compromised .
in the uk there is currently no requirement to reveal , for example , when a database has been hacked into or computer records have been stolen or lost .
consumer groups argue that if people are informed they can take preventative action to stop identity theft .
identity crime already affects 100,000 people a year in the uk and costs the economy £ 1.7 billion .
criminals most frequently take out loans in their victim 's name and run up huge debts .
in the us , 34 states have already made it law to reveal breaches affecting identity security .
they took action because millions of people were being put at risk through security lapses by both business and government .
fewer victims we have slowed the incidents of identity theft dramatically debra bowen , us senator the us consumers union and the public interest research group -lrb- pirg -rrb- both support the laws which were first introduced in california by senator debra bowen .
she said they have proved a great success and led to almost daily declarations of security breaches and blunders that put consumers at risk .
it has also resulted in a tightening up of database security because organisations do not like to be named and shamed .
senator bowen told bbc radio 4 's money box investigates : " it had gone from where there was the occasional theft of a credit card application from someone 's mailbox to massive fraud causing enormous personal losses as well as a big negative for the business community .
" we have slowed the incidents of identity theft dramatically and that means fewer people are being victimised . "
rapid growth in the uk data handling is covered by the data protection act but that does not include any requirement for those who experience security breaches to publicly declare it or warn the potential identity theft victims .
all countries should give consumers greater protection ed mierzwinski , pirg ed mierzwinski , consumer programme director of pirg , based in washington , admires the uk 's act but fears the rapid growth of identity theft means it is now not strong enough .
he told the programme : " you 'll need to upgrade even strong data protection acts to give consumers more control over their information so england , france , germany , all countries should give consumers greater protection -lsb- and -rsb- notice -lsb- of -rsb- when companies lose their information . "
his calls for more to be done to protect the growing number of identity theft victims in the uk are backed up by the uk national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- .
its deputy director of policy , claire whyley , said : " at the moment there 's no duty on organisations to inform their consumers or anybody else of security breaches .
" there 's a huge disincentive for companies to voluntarily provide information about security breaches because it 's not going to look good to consumers and they may lose custom as a result of it .
so we really do need a duty in place to compel them to do that . "
' good practice ' the information commissioner said a greater debate is needed but the information commissioner , richard thomas , who enforces the data protection act , told the programme the uk already has a higher level of legal protection than the us .
and he said so far the uk does not seem to have had the same sort of problems the us has been experiencing .
he would like to encourage organisations to notify security breaches as " good practice " but said whether to make that a legal requirement needs a greater debate which has not yet started .
have your say what would you suggest to reduce id theft ?
should it be law to reveal security breaches ?
join the debate any changes to the data protection act would come via parliament .
at the moment the government minister in charge of identity issues , joan ryan mp , says there are no plans to introduce a us-style breach law here .
she told the programme : " we could be asking all public and private sector to be sending out these notices .
" it could become like confetti and perhaps just increase levels of fear and feelings of vulnerability .
" i think it 's something we have to watch but i think we have to look at in context of the different kinds of systems and different legislation that exists between ourselves and the united states . "
and she said the home office already publishes a range of information to enable people to keep a check on whether they have , or could be , a victim of identity theft or identity fraud .

fewer victims we have slowed the incidents of identity theft dramatically debra bowen , us senator the us consumers union and the public interest research group -lrb- pirg -rrb- both support the laws which were first introduced in california by senator debra bowen .
she said they have proved a great success and led to almost daily declarations of security breaches and blunders that put consumers at risk .
it has also resulted in a tightening up of database security because organisations do not like to be named and shamed .
senator bowen told bbc radio 4 's money box investigates : " it had gone from where there was the occasional theft of a credit card application from someone 's mailbox to massive fraud causing enormous personal losses as well as a big negative for the business community .
" we have slowed the incidents of identity theft dramatically and that means fewer people are being victimised . "
rapid growth in the uk data handling is covered by the data protection act but that does not include any requirement for those who experience security breaches to publicly declare it or warn the potential identity theft victims .
all countries should give consumers greater protection ed mierzwinski , pirg ed mierzwinski , consumer programme director of pirg , based in washington , admires the uk 's act but fears the rapid growth of identity theft means it is now not strong enough .
he told the programme : " you 'll need to upgrade even strong data protection acts to give consumers more control over their information so england , france , germany , all countries should give consumers greater protection -lsb- and -rsb- notice -lsb- of -rsb- when companies lose their information . "
his calls for more to be done to protect the growing number of identity theft victims in the uk are backed up by the uk national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- .
its deputy director of policy , claire whyley , said : " at the moment there 's no duty on organisations to inform their consumers or anybody else of security breaches .
" there 's a huge disincentive for companies to voluntarily provide information about security breaches because it 's not going to look good to consumers and they may lose custom as a result of it .
so we really do need a duty in place to compel them to do that . "
' good practice ' the information commissioner said a greater debate is needed but the information commissioner , richard thomas , who enforces the data protection act , told the programme the uk already has a higher level of legal protection than the us .
and he said so far the uk does not seem to have had the same sort of problems the us has been experiencing .
he would like to encourage organisations to notify security breaches as " good practice " but said whether to make that a legal requirement needs a greater debate which has not yet started .
have your say what would you suggest to reduce id theft ?
should it be law to reveal security breaches ?
join the debate any changes to the data protection act would come via parliament .
at the moment the government minister in charge of identity issues , joan ryan mp , says there are no plans to introduce a us-style breach law here .
she told the programme : " we could be asking all public and private sector to be sending out these notices .
" it could become like confetti and perhaps just increase levels of fear and feelings of vulnerability .
" i think it 's something we have to watch but i think we have to look at in context of the different kinds of systems and different legislation that exists between ourselves and the united states . "
and she said the home office already publishes a range of information to enable people to keep a check on whether they have , or could be , a victim of identity theft or identity fraud .

the unemployment rate fell to 4.1 % in july , down from 4.2 % the previous month , government data showed .
analysts said the figures indicated a steady improvement in the labour market which should help to lift the economy .
however , other data showed that household spending fell in july as a result of cool and rainy weather .
spending in july was down 1.3 % in july from a year earlier - the seventh month in a row that there has been a year-on-year decline , and worse than analysts ' predictions of a 0.8 % drop .
" the household spending data was a bit of a surprise , " said takuji aida , chief economist at barclays capital in tokyo .
" -lrb- but -rrb- as long as wages are rising , personal consumption should be supported . "
interest rates in july , the bank of japan raised its key interest rate from 0 % to 0.25 % , the first increase in nearly six years , as a result of strong growth and falling unemployment .
analysts said that the latest jobs data - which showed that the number of people employed had risen for the 15th month in a row on a year-on-year basis - showed the labour market remained strong .
" i expect the unemployment rate will soon improve to below 4 % , " said taro saito , senior economist at nil research institute .
however , despite the continued improvement in the labour market , analysts added that they saw little need for the bank of japan to raise rates further in the short term .

the unemployment rate fell to 4.1 % in july , down from 4.2 % the previous month , government data showed .
analysts said the figures indicated a steady improvement in the labour market which should help to lift the economy .
however , other data showed that household spending fell in july as a result of cool and rainy weather .
spending in july was down 1.3 % in july from a year earlier - the seventh month in a row that there has been a year-on-year decline , and worse than analysts ' predictions of a 0.8 % drop .
" the household spending data was a bit of a surprise , " said takuji aida , chief economist at barclays capital in tokyo .
" -lrb- but -rrb- as long as wages are rising , personal consumption should be supported . "
interest rates in july , the bank of japan raised its key interest rate from 0 % to 0.25 % , the first increase in nearly six years , as a result of strong growth and falling unemployment .
analysts said that the latest jobs data - which showed that the number of people employed had risen for the 15th month in a row on a year-on-year basis - showed the labour market remained strong .
" i expect the unemployment rate will soon improve to below 4 % , " said taro saito , senior economist at nil research institute .
however , despite the continued improvement in the labour market , analysts added that they saw little need for the bank of japan to raise rates further in the short term .

experts advise us to eat more fruit and veg ; boost protein and fibre intake ; make sure we get the optimum levels of vitamins and minerals .
but what actually happens to these nutrients once they are inside the body ?
food scientists , working in an area called bioavailability , are trying to answer this question in a bid to discover how people can get the very best out of what they eat .
toni steer , a nutritionist at the medical research council human nutrition research centre in cambridgeshire , said : " the idea that we absorb everything we eat just is n't true .
" while you may have a certain amount of a nutrient within a food , what is actually absorbed may be less .
" bioavailabity means how much of that nutrient within a food is usefully absorbed . "
but , she says , bioavailability is not set in stone , and researchers are working to find ways of manipulating the levels of nutrients that can be absorbed by the body .
" if people are meeting dietary requirements , all of the nutrients they need are probably being absorbed .
" but for people who suffer vitamin or mineral deficiencies , or for those in developing countries where nutrition is poor , research into bioavailability can be very useful . "
pop-eye 's favourite take iron - a lot of people are just not getting enough of it , and too little can lead to anaemia and increased susceptibility to infections .
but how we get our iron can impact on the amount we absorb , says richard faulks , a senior researcher at the institute of food research in norwich .
while red meat contains the type of iron - haem-iron - that is most readily absorbed by the body , vegetarians are pointed towards iron-rich foods such as spinach .
however , this vegetable contains the mineral in a form that is not so readily absorbed - non-haem iron .
tinned tomatoes are a better source of antioxidants but , explains mr faulks , a glass of orange juice alongside your plate of spinach can make all the difference .
" vitamin c in orange juice changes the iron to its non-oxidised state -lrb- haem iron -rrb- - which is much more readily absorbed than the oxidised iron -lrb- non-haem iron -rrb- .
" you can manipulate to some extent the gastric and small intestinal chemistry by what you eat and combine . "
conversely , explains dr steer , tea and coffee contain compounds called phenols that inhibit iron absorption - so they should n't be consumed alongside iron-rich foods .
raw vs cooked whether your food is raw or cooked can also make a difference .
tomatoes contain lycopene , a form of antioxidant .
antioxidants have been hailed for their ability to neutralize free radicals , which are linked to ageing , stroke and heart disease .
" if you have fresh tomatoes , they have a total antioxidant potential of about 80 , " explains dr catherine collins , a dietician at st george 's healthcare nhs trust .
once you can manipulate how nutrients are delivered into the body , it can help you to tailor a product that can deliver certain attributes richard faulks " but if you boil or can them the antioxidant potential goes up five or six-fold . "
" this happens because the lycopene in the raw tomato has been transformed to trans-lycopene in the cooked version , and trans-lycopene is much more readily absorbed . "
likewise , says dr collins , cooking carrots makes the beta-carotene , another form of antioxidant , more available because you break down the cell wall with the cooking process .
fat-loving a nutrient 's relationship with water and oil can also alter bioavailability .
mr faulks said : " to absorb fat-soluble nutrients , you have to get them out of the cellular structure , and then they have to be transferred into lipophilic - or fat-loving - carriers in the gut to be absorbed . "
lutein is one such nutrient .
present in spinach and other green vegetables such as kale , broccoli and peas , some evidence suggests it can protect or slow age-related macular degeneration , a leading cause of blindness .
dressing some raw vegetables with oil helps nutrient absorption " lutein is actually absorbed more efficiently if it is eaten with a little bit of fat , the oil helps it to hop onto to the fatty acids in the gut and to be absorbed , " said dr steer .
mr faulks believes bioavailability is a growing area , and something that has the potential to impact on the health-food industry : " once you begin to understand and can manipulate how nutrients are delivered into the body , it can help you to tailor a product that can deliver certain attributes . "
however , says dr steer , it is a complex field , especially because different nutrients interact in different ways .
" for a long time breakfast cereals have been fortified with added iron .
but they also contain phytates - a form of energy store - which are present in whole-grain cereals , and these actually inhibit the absorption of iron .
" and calcium in dairy products can also inhibit iron absorption .
so you have your cereal with iron and phytates , but then you pour on your milk that will also contribute to inhibition of the absorption of iron .
it can get very complicated . "
jigsaw puzzle according to researchers , there are pros and cons of combining food in this way .
by cooking tomatoes to gain antioxidants , vitamin c is degraded .
by adding fats to green vegetables , your cholesterol intake is boosted .
and , experts add , more is not always best .
high intake of some vitamins and minerals has been associated with risks .
but , says dr steer , the more we understand about how the body absorbs nutrients , the better the dietary recommendations we can make .
" it is all about understanding how these nutrients are absorbed in the body , and how much of them we need to reduce or even prevent certain diseases while avoiding any adverse symptoms .
" understanding bioavailability it is really part of the jigsaw of understanding optimum nutrition . "

experts advise us to eat more fruit and veg ; boost protein and fibre intake ; make sure we get the optimum levels of vitamins and minerals .
but what actually happens to these nutrients once they are inside the body ?
food scientists , working in an area called bioavailability , are trying to answer this question in a bid to discover how people can get the very best out of what they eat .
toni steer , a nutritionist at the medical research council human nutrition research centre in cambridgeshire , said : " the idea that we absorb everything we eat just is n't true .
" while you may have a certain amount of a nutrient within a food , what is actually absorbed may be less .
" bioavailabity means how much of that nutrient within a food is usefully absorbed . "
but , she says , bioavailability is not set in stone , and researchers are working to find ways of manipulating the levels of nutrients that can be absorbed by the body .
" if people are meeting dietary requirements , all of the nutrients they need are probably being absorbed .
" but for people who suffer vitamin or mineral deficiencies , or for those in developing countries where nutrition is poor , research into bioavailability can be very useful . "
pop-eye 's favourite take iron - a lot of people are just not getting enough of it , and too little can lead to anaemia and increased susceptibility to infections .
but how we get our iron can impact on the amount we absorb , says richard faulks , a senior researcher at the institute of food research in norwich .
while red meat contains the type of iron - haem-iron - that is most readily absorbed by the body , vegetarians are pointed towards iron-rich foods such as spinach .
however , this vegetable contains the mineral in a form that is not so readily absorbed - non-haem iron .
tinned tomatoes are a better source of antioxidants but , explains mr faulks , a glass of orange juice alongside your plate of spinach can make all the difference .
" vitamin c in orange juice changes the iron to its non-oxidised state -lrb- haem iron -rrb- - which is much more readily absorbed than the oxidised iron -lrb- non-haem iron -rrb- .
" you can manipulate to some extent the gastric and small intestinal chemistry by what you eat and combine . "
conversely , explains dr steer , tea and coffee contain compounds called phenols that inhibit iron absorption - so they should n't be consumed alongside iron-rich foods .
raw vs cooked whether your food is raw or cooked can also make a difference .
tomatoes contain lycopene , a form of antioxidant .
antioxidants have been hailed for their ability to neutralize free radicals , which are linked to ageing , stroke and heart disease .
" if you have fresh tomatoes , they have a total antioxidant potential of about 80 , " explains dr catherine collins , a dietician at st george 's healthcare nhs trust .
once you can manipulate how nutrients are delivered into the body , it can help you to tailor a product that can deliver certain attributes richard faulks " but if you boil or can them the antioxidant potential goes up five or six-fold . "
" this happens because the lycopene in the raw tomato has been transformed to trans-lycopene in the cooked version , and trans-lycopene is much more readily absorbed . "
likewise , says dr collins , cooking carrots makes the beta-carotene , another form of antioxidant , more available because you break down the cell wall with the cooking process .
fat-loving a nutrient 's relationship with water and oil can also alter bioavailability .
mr faulks said : " to absorb fat-soluble nutrients , you have to get them out of the cellular structure , and then they have to be transferred into lipophilic - or fat-loving - carriers in the gut to be absorbed . "
lutein is one such nutrient .
present in spinach and other green vegetables such as kale , broccoli and peas , some evidence suggests it can protect or slow age-related macular degeneration , a leading cause of blindness .
dressing some raw vegetables with oil helps nutrient absorption " lutein is actually absorbed more efficiently if it is eaten with a little bit of fat , the oil helps it to hop onto to the fatty acids in the gut and to be absorbed , " said dr steer .
mr faulks believes bioavailability is a growing area , and something that has the potential to impact on the health-food industry : " once you begin to understand and can manipulate how nutrients are delivered into the body , it can help you to tailor a product that can deliver certain attributes . "
however , says dr steer , it is a complex field , especially because different nutrients interact in different ways .
" for a long time breakfast cereals have been fortified with added iron .
but they also contain phytates - a form of energy store - which are present in whole-grain cereals , and these actually inhibit the absorption of iron .
" and calcium in dairy products can also inhibit iron absorption .
so you have your cereal with iron and phytates , but then you pour on your milk that will also contribute to inhibition of the absorption of iron .
it can get very complicated . "

by cooking tomatoes to gain antioxidants , vitamin c is degraded .
by adding fats to green vegetables , your cholesterol intake is boosted .

one parent who has already been doing that for years is sue breetzke , 49 , a project manager and homeopath from forest row , east sussex .
she has raised eight children with her husband keith and has always kept a strict eye on their diet , particularly their sugar intake .
" when my eldest daughter licia was 22 months , her brother was born and she went to stay with her grandparents for a little while , " she said .
" i noticed she was getting snotty noses and bad throats and realised that grandparents are much more likely to spoil with sweets and treats .
she was also more hyperactive .
" so i cut all the junk food out of her diet and immediately noticed she was less likely to get colds or flu .
the majority of what i cut out was sugar . "
sugar ban when mrs breetzke first met her husband the couple had four children between them , and she imposed strict dietary controls on them all .
" i was really rigid in making sure they did n't have sugar , and when i say none i mean none .
" as a result they were all incredibly healthy .
when we went to the doctor they had to dig out our files because we had n't been to see them for so long .
" i did notice that the more sugar they ate , the more ear , nose and throat problems they had , and they were also more hyper .
" i used to see this when they came back from a birthday party where they 'd eaten sugary food .
" when they were under five i could control their diet , but when they were six and went to school i had to relax it .
" but i still went to the shops and supervised how they spent their pocket money . "
i was really rigid in making sure they did n't have sugar , and when i say none i mean none sue breetzke children ' stock up on junk food ' a potential problem arose , said mrs breetzke , when her children began to attend secondary school and were able to gain more independence - but they passed with flying colours .
" my youngest daughter , seren , is 17 and she can leave her school at lunchtimes - so there is a temptation to buy junk - but the good habits i 've instilled in her seem to be holding .
" she 'll buy fruit and milk and is a great water drinker instead of having sweets and fizzy drinks .
" it 's not always easy to get kids to eat healthily , especially with other kids bringing in lunchboxes to school .
" i introduced new flavours to my children 's diets , like broccoli and other vegetables , to make food more interesting . "
mrs breetzke said the key to getting children to eat better and cut down on sugary foods is to instil good eating habits in them at an early stage .
" if you can get them to eat healthily when they 're young then i have found that in adulthood these habits will remain .
" my children did experiment , they did eat junk food but did n't do it to excess .
" children should be vital and healthy and so many of them are n't because their bodies are n't getting good nutrients and are getting lots of sugar instead . "

" i noticed she was getting snotty noses and bad throats and realised that grandparents are much more likely to spoil with sweets and treats .

the five-year plan on workplace security , the first of its kind , will particularly target the coal mining industry , xinhua news agency said .
china 's mines are among the most dangerous in the world , with more than 5,000 deaths reported every year .
the plan aims to encourage the reporting of poor safety practices .
in addition to the mining industry , the plan would also target chemical and fireworks factories , xinhua said .
funds of 467.4bn yuan -lrb- $ 58.6bn -rrb- will be invested in nine safety projects , with emphasis on monitoring production safety , education campaigns and improving workplace management .
the plan aims to reduce the industrial death rate from 3.85 per 100,000 workers to 2.8 by 2010 .
targets last year , 127,000 people died in accidents in the workplace , and in 17 cases the number of casualties exceeded 30 , xinhua said .
the high death rate is in part due to local officials turning a " blind eye " , xinhua said .
as china 's economy has expanded , some local officials have ignored safety concerns in factories and mines in order to achieve production and profit targets .
under the new plan , adherence to work safety practices would be a factor in the way local officials were evaluated , the agency said .
beijing has been working to introduce measures to improve mine safety and in april pledged to close all small coal mines by 2007 .
but coal provides more than two-thirds of china 's electricity , and production has been stepped up to meet expanding demand .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- fans hail return of dylan bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture tuesday , 29 august 2006 , 07:54 gmt 08:54 uk fans hail return of dylan early critical reception to bob dylan 's first album for five years suggests the 65-year-old is far from ready for retirement .
the living legend 's 44th album , modern times , earned five-star reviews in uncut and rolling stone magazines , with the latter calling it a " masterwork " .
the bbc news website asked six dylan fans to explain their enduring fascination with the man and his music .
katie melua , singer-songwriter bob willis , former england cricketer christopher ricks , university of oxford professor of poetry stevie jackson , belle and sebastian guitarist david chaytor mp sir liam donaldson , chief medical officer for england katie melua , 21 , singer-songwriter georgia-born katie melua has sold more than five million copies of her first two albums , call off the search and piece by piece . "
i am a big fan for someone who was n't there - i have discovered him afterwards , without being caught up in the dylan mania that there must have been at the time .
a lot of my friends are fans of dylan - i think it makes him unusual .
with any artist , their core fans are going to be the people of that generation . "
i would give anything to be 10 % as good as he is " i think he is one of those artists who seems to still capture young people , and i think that mainly is because his voice is of the young , talking of rebellion and talking about politics .
when i listen to masters of war it articulates exactly how i feel about the current situation that is happening today .
i feel like through these songs , especially certain lyrics , he says the stuff that i want current artists to be saying , but they are not .
i go to him to get that fix .
i do n't know anyone within music who is n't either a fan or who does n't respect his work on some level .
i would give anything to be 10 % as good as he is .
i think he has said enough important things for us to be interested in what he has to say next .
i am just quite fascinated to see where he is in his head at the moment . "
bob willis , 57 , former england cricketer bob willis , the former england cricketer and sky sports commentator , says he has just two artists on his ipod - van morrison and dylan .
as a teenager , willis adopted the middle name dylan in the artist 's honour . "
a mate of mine , who i was playing football with , handed me bob dylan 's first album -lrb- bob dylan -rrb- which was released in 1962 and after that i was hooked .
bob dylan was singing about furious political issues and getting under the skin of everybody and that 's what appealed to me - the music , the voice , the lyrics all combined to be something really special for me .
it has been a long ride .
there have been trying times along the way - there have been some pretty grim albums - but i have liked most of it .
i am not saying if he started singing nursery rhymes i would rush out and buy the cd , but almost that bad , i think . "
he has got to a completely new audience , and i do n't think many artists can say that " i got ian botham to a dylan concert in new zealand in 1978 , and he still listens from time to time - there have been a few converts along the way .
the ability of the guy to turn out fantastic lyrics , fantastic rhymes , and then in live performance to reconceive these songs into different interpretations is what 's really appealed to me .
if people go expecting to hear cd recordings , that 's never what they get - he always puts a different slant on the songs .
these days half the audience are under 35 - it really is brilliant to see .
he has got to a completely new audience , and i do n't think many artists can say that they have managed to do that .
the last two albums -lrb- time out of mind and love and theft -rrb- have been some of his best stuff .
the lyrics are still brilliant .
i heard he hired a theatre and did quite a lot of rehearsing for the new album - i am expecting something quite special . "
christopher ricks , 72 university of oxford professor of poetry christopher ricks is professor of humanities at boston university and professor of poetry at oxford .
he has written books about poets including tennyson , milton , keats and ts eliot , and one about a popular musician , dylan 's visions of sin . "
dylan seized me in the ' 60s as nobody else has seized me .
i think he is a genius .
i think he is extraordinarily accomplished in the three things that come together to make a song , that is , a voice , a melody of some sort and the words . "
i would be very , very surprised if the new album does n't have , as always , some unprecedentedly good songs " i had no hostility to the voice from the beginning .
as far as i am concerned , and as far as an enormous number of people are concerned , dylan is nonpareil .
i think it 's like an athlete - a combination of terrific training and discipline , with intuition and instinct .
i think there are concessions that he needs to make with concert performance that for my old ears are too large a price to pay - i wait for the acoustic set .
i hear the subtlety and the nuance more when there is n't the dynamic force of really loud playing .
i did n't like the disparagement of everything between blood on the tracks -lrb- 1975 -rrb- and time out of mind -lrb- 1997 -rrb- .
i thought that was really dumb - oh mercy -lrb- 1989 -rrb- had some wonderful songs on it .
i think there are no albums which do n't have any good songs on them .
he has been able to do new things .
-lsb- his autobiography -rsb- chronicles is quite unlike anything he has done - the acclaim that received is very well justified .
it 's a very funny , sad , deeply grateful and fabulous book .
i have deliberately avoided these bootlegs -lsb- of modern times -rsb- that have been circulating .
i do n't know what to expect , but i would be very , very surprised if it does n't have , as always , some unprecedentedly good songs . "
stevie jackson , 37 , belle and sebastian guitarist pop group belle and sebastian referenced guitarist stevie jackson 's musical hero in their song like dylan in the movies .
jackson says their video for the wrong girl also featured him recreating a teenage quest to find a jacket like one worn by dylan . "
the first record i ever got hold of , when i was 14 or 15 , was blonde on blonde and it changed my life completely .
the music itself just seemed beyond anything i had been listening to .
the way he looked and the sound of his voice , the words he was saying just seemed so oblique but they just made so much sense .
the clothes he was wearing and the cover - it was like this complete art statement . "
what he has produced in the last 10 years has been superb " at that point in my life i was pretty obsessive - i was on a quest to find the perfect blonde on blonde jacket .
by the time i was 16 i had seen -lsb- documentary -rsb- do n't look back , and you got to hear him talking and he was just so funny and so comical and so intelligent , and had such great clothes and such a great haircut and great shades - his sunglasses are unparalleled .
in the ' 80s he just seemed completely out of place and like he did n't belong there and his records were pretty lousy , but for me what he has produced in the last 10 years has been superb .
his last few records , i have loved them all .
i think we are in a classic dylan era at the moment .
i have seen him regularly live since 1989 .
for me , the last five years , the shows i have seen , you are witnessing a great artist engaged and producing great art , rather than just an old guy going through the motions .
and once again the clothes are there , the look is there - he is looking totally cool and that goes a long way . "
david chaytor mp , 57 in a british library survey of mps , david chaytor named dylan 's john wesley harding -lrb- 1967 -rrb- as his favourite album .
but the bury north mp admits his wife submitted that answer , and that he would choose 1976 's desire . "
i have been a dylan fan for the best part of 40 years .
as a teenager the anti-establishment ethos appealed to me .
my interest was revived when my own kids became teenagers and they also became big dylan fans .
the capacity to re-excite kids in successive generations is an important one . "
dylan reminds us there is an alternative political and cultural tradition in the us to that represented by george bush " then i had a big revival again after the martin scorsese film -lsb- no direction home -rsb- last year .
i thought it was an outstanding film and it gave a wonderful insight into that period of musical and political history .
i thought the clip of bob dylan and joan baez singing with god on our side at the 1963 newport folk festival , what would have been 12 months after the cuban missile crisis , was extremely telling .
the issues dylan 's music in the 1960s was about , and the critique of american domestic and foreign policy of the 1960s , are absolutely relevant to 2006 .
dylan reminds us that there is an alternative political and cultural tradition in the us that is quite different to that represented by george bush .
for those of us nearing our free bus pass , someone who is still singing and recording at the age of 65 is great news , a source of great optimism .
i must now systematically revisit all 43 albums and play them through - that is my autumn project . "
sir liam donaldson , 57 chief medical officer for england sir liam donaldson describes himself as a " lifelong fan " of dylan . "
i first was introduced to his work by an older cousin in 1964 - he had an album called another side of bob dylan .
i became totally absorbed in the album - it was unlike anything else i had heard before .
up until then i had been listening to the beatles and tamla motown and the beach boys , all of which i really cherished at the level of music and tunefulness . "
the words , the songs , the music , have been almost embedded in my stream of consciousness over 40 years " but dylan seemed to be talking to me about emotions and feelings and aspirations .
there was a voice and an intelligence behind the songs - it was accessible poetry .
looking back over the 44 albums , there have n't been that many really bad ones .
there have been a few mediocre ones , but even those have had good songs on them - compared to any other artist , it 's a fantastic record .
he has maintained a bit of an air of mystery over the years , and when i read chronicles i was amazed by how revealing he was - it was actually quite open .
i think it has been a bit of an interesting phase with the martin scorsese video and chronicles ; it has stoked expectation for the new album .
speaking personally , the words , the songs , the music , have been almost embedded in my stream of consciousness over 40 years .

the living legend 's 44th album , modern times , earned five-star reviews in uncut and rolling stone magazines , with the latter calling it a " masterwork " .
the bbc news website asked six dylan fans to explain their enduring fascination with the man and his music .
" he has said enough important things for us to be interested in what he has to say next " katie melua , singer-songwriter " the music , the voice , the lyrics all combined to be something really special for me " bob willis , former england cricketer " dylan seized me in the 60s as nobody else has seized me " christopher ricks , university of oxford professor of poetry " i think we are in a classic dylan era at the moment " stevie jackson , belle and sebastian guitarist " as a teenager the anti-establishment ethos appealed to me " david chaytor mp " his work for me is a real touchstone - it 's almost a true north " sir liam donaldson , chief medical officer for england katie melua , 21 , singer-songwriter georgia-born katie melua has sold more than five million copies of her first two albums , call off the search and piece by piece .
i am a big fan for someone who was n't there - i have discovered him afterwards , without being caught up in the dylan mania that there must have been at the time .
a lot of my friends are fans of dylan - i think it makes him unusual .
with any artist , their core fans are going to be the people of that generation .
i would give anything to be 10 % as good as he is i think he is one of those artists who seems to still capture young people , and i think that mainly is because his voice is of the young , talking of rebellion and talking about politics .
when i listen to masters of war it articulates exactly how i feel about the current situation that is happening today .
i feel like through these songs , especially certain lyrics , he says the stuff that i want current artists to be saying , but they are not .
i go to him to get that fix .
i do n't know anyone within music who is n't either a fan or who does n't respect his work on some level .
i would give anything to be 10 % as good as he is .
i think he has said enough important things for us to be interested in what he has to say next .
i am just quite fascinated to see where he is in his head at the moment .
click here to return to the top bob willis , 57 , former england cricketer bob willis , the former england cricketer and sky sports commentator , says he has just two artists on his ipod - van morrison and dylan .
as a teenager , willis adopted the middle name dylan in the artist 's honour .
a mate of mine , who i was playing football with , handed me bob dylan 's first album -lrb- bob dylan -rrb- which was released in 1962 and after that i was hooked .
bob dylan was singing about furious political issues and getting under the skin of everybody and that 's what appealed to me - the music , the voice , the lyrics all combined to be something really special for me .
it has been a long ride .
there have been trying times along the way - there have been some pretty grim albums - but i have liked most of it .
i am not saying if he started singing nursery rhymes i would rush out and buy the cd , but almost that bad , i think .
he has got to a completely new audience , and i do n't think many artists can say that i got ian botham to a dylan concert in new zealand in 1978 , and he still listens from time to time - there have been a few converts along the way .
the ability of the guy to turn out fantastic lyrics , fantastic rhymes , and then in live performance to reconceive these songs into different interpretations is what 's really appealed to me .
if people go expecting to hear cd recordings , that 's never what they get - he always puts a different slant on the songs .
these days half the audience are under 35 - it really is brilliant to see .
he has got to a completely new audience , and i do n't think many artists can say that they have managed to do that .
the last two albums -lrb- time out of mind and love and theft -rrb- have been some of his best stuff .
the lyrics are still brilliant .
i heard he hired a theatre and did quite a lot of rehearsing for the new album - i am expecting something quite special .
click here to return to the top christopher ricks , 72 university of oxford professor of poetry christopher ricks is professor of humanities at boston university and professor of poetry at oxford .
he has written books about poets including tennyson , milton , keats and ts eliot , and one about a popular musician , dylan 's visions of sin .
dylan seized me in the ' 60s as nobody else has seized me .
i think he is a genius .
i think he is extraordinarily accomplished in the three things that come together to make a song , that is , a voice , a melody of some sort and the words .
i would be very , very surprised if the new album does n't have , as always , some unprecedentedly good songs i had no hostility to the voice from the beginning .
as far as i am concerned , and as far as an enormous number of people are concerned , dylan is nonpareil .
i think it 's like an athlete - a combination of terrific training and discipline , with intuition and instinct .
i think there are concessions that he needs to make with concert performance that for my old ears are too large a price to pay - i wait for the acoustic set .
i hear the subtlety and the nuance more when there is n't the dynamic force of really loud playing .
dylan has been on a so-called " never-ending tour " since the 90s i did n't like the disparagement of everything between blood on the tracks -lrb- 1975 -rrb- and time out of mind -lrb- 1997 -rrb- .
i thought that was really dumb - oh mercy -lrb- 1989 -rrb- had some wonderful songs on it .
i think there are no albums which do n't have any good songs on them .
he has been able to do new things .
-lsb- his autobiography -rsb- chronicles is quite unlike anything he has done - the acclaim that received is very well justified .
it 's a very funny , sad , deeply grateful and fabulous book .
i have deliberately avoided these bootlegs -lsb- of modern times -rsb- that have been circulating .
i do n't know what to expect , but i would be very , very surprised if it does n't have , as always , some unprecedentedly good songs .
click here to return to the top stevie jackson , 37 , belle and sebastian guitarist pop group belle and sebastian referenced guitarist stevie jackson 's musical hero in their song like dylan in the movies .
jackson says their video for the wrong girl also featured him recreating a teenage quest to find a jacket like one worn by dylan .
the first record i ever got hold of , when i was 14 or 15 , was blonde on blonde and it changed my life completely .
the music itself just seemed beyond anything i had been listening to .
the way he looked and the sound of his voice , the words he was saying just seemed so oblique but they just made so much sense .
the clothes he was wearing and the cover - it was like this complete art statement .
what he has produced in the last 10 years has been superb at that point in my life i was pretty obsessive - i was on a quest to find the perfect blonde on blonde jacket .
by the time i was 16 i had seen -lsb- documentary -rsb- do n't look back , and you got to hear him talking and he was just so funny and so comical and so intelligent , and had such great clothes and such a great haircut and great shades - his sunglasses are unparalleled .
in the ' 80s he just seemed completely out of place and like he did n't belong there and his records were pretty lousy , but for me what he has produced in the last 10 years has been superb .
his last few records , i have loved them all .
i think we are in a classic dylan era at the moment .
i have seen him regularly live since 1989 .
for me , the last five years , the shows i have seen , you are witnessing a great artist engaged and producing great art , rather than just an old guy going through the motions .
and once again the clothes are there , the look is there - he is looking totally cool and that goes a long way .
click here to return to the top david chaytor mp , 57 in a british library survey of mps , david chaytor named dylan 's john wesley harding -lrb- 1967 -rrb- as his favourite album .
but the bury north mp admits his wife submitted that answer , and that he would choose 1976 's desire .
i have been a dylan fan for the best part of 40 years .
as a teenager the anti-establishment ethos appealed to me .
my interest was revived when my own kids became teenagers and they also became big dylan fans .
the capacity to re-excite kids in successive generations is an important one .
dylan reminds us there is an alternative political and cultural tradition in the us to that represented by george bush then i had a big revival again after the martin scorsese film -lsb- no direction home -rsb- last year .
i thought it was an outstanding film and it gave a wonderful insight into that period of musical and political history .
i thought the clip of bob dylan and joan baez singing with god on our side at the 1963 newport folk festival , what would have been 12 months after the cuban missile crisis , was extremely telling .
the issues dylan 's music in the 1960s was about , and the critique of american domestic and foreign policy of the 1960s , are absolutely relevant to 2006 .
dylan reminds us that there is an alternative political and cultural tradition in the us that is quite different to that represented by george bush .
for those of us nearing our free bus pass , someone who is still singing and recording at the age of 65 is great news , a source of great optimism .
i must now systematically revisit all 43 albums and play them through - that is my autumn project .
click here to return to the top sir liam donaldson , 57 chief medical officer for england sir liam donaldson describes himself as a " lifelong fan " of dylan .
i first was introduced to his work by an older cousin in 1964 - he had an album called another side of bob dylan .
i became totally absorbed in the album - it was unlike anything else i had heard before .
up until then i had been listening to the beatles and tamla motown and the beach boys , all of which i really cherished at the level of music and tunefulness .
the words , the songs , the music , have been almost embedded in my stream of consciousness over 40 years but dylan seemed to be talking to me about emotions and feelings and aspirations .
there was a voice and an intelligence behind the songs - it was accessible poetry .
looking back over the 44 albums , there have n't been that many really bad ones .
there have been a few mediocre ones , but even those have had good songs on them - compared to any other artist , it 's a fantastic record .
he has maintained a bit of an air of mystery over the years , and when i read chronicles i was amazed by how revealing he was - it was actually quite open .
i think it has been a bit of an interesting phase with the martin scorsese video and chronicles ; it has stoked expectation for the new album .
speaking personally , the words , the songs , the music , have been almost embedded in my stream of consciousness over 40 years .
his work for me is a real touchstone .
it 's almost a true north .

a mate of mine , who i was playing football with , handed me bob dylan 's first album -lrb- bob dylan -rrb- which was released in 1962 and after that i was hooked .
bob dylan was singing about furious political issues and getting under the skin of everybody and that 's what appealed to me - the music , the voice , the lyrics all combined to be something really special for me .
it has been a long ride .
there have been trying times along the way - there have been some pretty grim albums - but i have liked most of it .
i am not saying if he started singing nursery rhymes i would rush out and buy the cd , but almost that bad , i think .
he has got to a completely new audience , and i do n't think many artists can say that i got ian botham to a dylan concert in new zealand in 1978 , and he still listens from time to time - there have been a few converts along the way .
the ability of the guy to turn out fantastic lyrics , fantastic rhymes , and then in live performance to reconceive these songs into different interpretations is what 's really appealed to me .
if people go expecting to hear cd recordings , that 's never what they get - he always puts a different slant on the songs .
these days half the audience are under 35 - it really is brilliant to see .
he has got to a completely new audience , and i do n't think many artists can say that they have managed to do that .
the last two albums -lrb- time out of mind and love and theft -rrb- have been some of his best stuff .
the lyrics are still brilliant .
i heard he hired a theatre and did quite a lot of rehearsing for the new album - i am expecting something quite special .
click here to return to the top christopher ricks , 72 university of oxford professor of poetry christopher ricks is professor of humanities at boston university and professor of poetry at oxford .
he has written books about poets including tennyson , milton , keats and ts eliot , and one about a popular musician , dylan 's visions of sin .
dylan seized me in the ' 60s as nobody else has seized me .
i think he is a genius .
i think he is extraordinarily accomplished in the three things that come together to make a song , that is , a voice , a melody of some sort and the words .
i would be very , very surprised if the new album does n't have , as always , some unprecedentedly good songs i had no hostility to the voice from the beginning .
as far as i am concerned , and as far as an enormous number of people are concerned , dylan is nonpareil .
i think it 's like an athlete - a combination of terrific training and discipline , with intuition and instinct .
i think there are concessions that he needs to make with concert performance that for my old ears are too large a price to pay - i wait for the acoustic set .
i hear the subtlety and the nuance more when there is n't the dynamic force of really loud playing .
dylan has been on a so-called " never-ending tour " since the 90s i did n't like the disparagement of everything between blood on the tracks -lrb- 1975 -rrb- and time out of mind -lrb- 1997 -rrb- .
i thought that was really dumb - oh mercy -lrb- 1989 -rrb- had some wonderful songs on it .
i think there are no albums which do n't have any good songs on them .
he has been able to do new things .
-lsb- his autobiography -rsb- chronicles is quite unlike anything he has done - the acclaim that received is very well justified .
it 's a very funny , sad , deeply grateful and fabulous book .
i have deliberately avoided these bootlegs -lsb- of modern times -rsb- that have been circulating .
i do n't know what to expect , but i would be very , very surprised if it does n't have , as always , some unprecedentedly good songs .
click here to return to the top stevie jackson , 37 , belle and sebastian guitarist pop group belle and sebastian referenced guitarist stevie jackson 's musical hero in their song like dylan in the movies .
jackson says their video for the wrong girl also featured him recreating a teenage quest to find a jacket like one worn by dylan .
the first record i ever got hold of , when i was 14 or 15 , was blonde on blonde and it changed my life completely .
the music itself just seemed beyond anything i had been listening to .
the way he looked and the sound of his voice , the words he was saying just seemed so oblique but they just made so much sense .
the clothes he was wearing and the cover - it was like this complete art statement .
what he has produced in the last 10 years has been superb at that point in my life i was pretty obsessive - i was on a quest to find the perfect blonde on blonde jacket .
by the time i was 16 i had seen -lsb- documentary -rsb- do n't look back , and you got to hear him talking and he was just so funny and so comical and so intelligent , and had such great clothes and such a great haircut and great shades - his sunglasses are unparalleled .
in the ' 80s he just seemed completely out of place and like he did n't belong there and his records were pretty lousy , but for me what he has produced in the last 10 years has been superb .
his last few records , i have loved them all .
i think we are in a classic dylan era at the moment .
i have seen him regularly live since 1989 .
for me , the last five years , the shows i have seen , you are witnessing a great artist engaged and producing great art , rather than just an old guy going through the motions .
and once again the clothes are there , the look is there - he is looking totally cool and that goes a long way .
click here to return to the top david chaytor mp , 57 in a british library survey of mps , david chaytor named dylan 's john wesley harding -lrb- 1967 -rrb- as his favourite album .
but the bury north mp admits his wife submitted that answer , and that he would choose 1976 's desire .
i have been a dylan fan for the best part of 40 years .
as a teenager the anti-establishment ethos appealed to me .
my interest was revived when my own kids became teenagers and they also became big dylan fans .
the capacity to re-excite kids in successive generations is an important one .
dylan reminds us there is an alternative political and cultural tradition in the us to that represented by george bush then i had a big revival again after the martin scorsese film -lsb- no direction home -rsb- last year .
i thought it was an outstanding film and it gave a wonderful insight into that period of musical and political history .
i thought the clip of bob dylan and joan baez singing with god on our side at the 1963 newport folk festival , what would have been 12 months after the cuban missile crisis , was extremely telling .
the issues dylan 's music in the 1960s was about , and the critique of american domestic and foreign policy of the 1960s , are absolutely relevant to 2006 .
dylan reminds us that there is an alternative political and cultural tradition in the us that is quite different to that represented by george bush .
for those of us nearing our free bus pass , someone who is still singing and recording at the age of 65 is great news , a source of great optimism .
i must now systematically revisit all 43 albums and play them through - that is my autumn project .
click here to return to the top sir liam donaldson , 57 chief medical officer for england sir liam donaldson describes himself as a " lifelong fan " of dylan .
i first was introduced to his work by an older cousin in 1964 - he had an album called another side of bob dylan .
i became totally absorbed in the album - it was unlike anything else i had heard before .
up until then i had been listening to the beatles and tamla motown and the beach boys , all of which i really cherished at the level of music and tunefulness .
the words , the songs , the music , have been almost embedded in my stream of consciousness over 40 years but dylan seemed to be talking to me about emotions and feelings and aspirations .
there was a voice and an intelligence behind the songs - it was accessible poetry .
looking back over the 44 albums , there have n't been that many really bad ones .
there have been a few mediocre ones , but even those have had good songs on them - compared to any other artist , it 's a fantastic record .
he has maintained a bit of an air of mystery over the years , and when i read chronicles i was amazed by how revealing he was - it was actually quite open .
i think it has been a bit of an interesting phase with the martin scorsese video and chronicles ; it has stoked expectation for the new album .
speaking personally , the words , the songs , the music , have been almost embedded in my stream of consciousness over 40 years .
his work for me is a real touchstone .
it 's almost a true north .

i am a big fan for someone who was n't there - i have discovered him afterwards , without being caught up in the dylan mania that there must have been at the time .
a lot of my friends are fans of dylan - i think it makes him unusual .
with any artist , their core fans are going to be the people of that generation .
i would give anything to be 10 % as good as he is i think he is one of those artists who seems to still capture young people , and i think that mainly is because his voice is of the young , talking of rebellion and talking about politics .
when i listen to masters of war it articulates exactly how i feel about the current situation that is happening today .
i feel like through these songs , especially certain lyrics , he says the stuff that i want current artists to be saying , but they are not .
i go to him to get that fix .
i do n't know anyone within music who is n't either a fan or who does n't respect his work on some level .
i would give anything to be 10 % as good as he is .

in the ' 80s he just seemed completely out of place and like he did n't belong there and his records were pretty lousy , but for me what he has produced in the last 10 years has been superb .
his last few records , i have loved them all .
i think we are in a classic dylan era at the moment .
i have seen him regularly live since 1989 .
for me , the last five years , the shows i have seen , you are witnessing a great artist engaged and producing great art , rather than just an old guy going through the motions .
and once again the clothes are there , the look is there - he is looking totally cool and that goes a long way .

but the bury north mp admits his wife submitted that answer , and that he would choose 1976 's desire .
i have been a dylan fan for the best part of 40 years .
as a teenager the anti-establishment ethos appealed to me .
my interest was revived when my own kids became teenagers and they also became big dylan fans .
the capacity to re-excite kids in successive generations is an important one .
dylan reminds us there is an alternative political and cultural tradition in the us to that represented by george bush then i had a big revival again after the martin scorsese film -lsb- no direction home -rsb- last year .
i thought it was an outstanding film and it gave a wonderful insight into that period of musical and political history .
i thought the clip of bob dylan and joan baez singing with god on our side at the 1963 newport folk festival , what would have been 12 months after the cuban missile crisis , was extremely telling .
the issues dylan 's music in the 1960s was about , and the critique of american domestic and foreign policy of the 1960s , are absolutely relevant to 2006 .
dylan reminds us that there is an alternative political and cultural tradition in the us that is quite different to that represented by george bush .
for those of us nearing our free bus pass , someone who is still singing and recording at the age of 65 is great news , a source of great optimism .
i must now systematically revisit all 43 albums and play them through - that is my autumn project .

i first was introduced to his work by an older cousin in 1964 - he had an album called another side of bob dylan .
i became totally absorbed in the album - it was unlike anything else i had heard before .
up until then i had been listening to the beatles and tamla motown and the beach boys , all of which i really cherished at the level of music and tunefulness .
the words , the songs , the music , have been almost embedded in my stream of consciousness over 40 years but dylan seemed to be talking to me about emotions and feelings and aspirations .
there was a voice and an intelligence behind the songs - it was accessible poetry .
looking back over the 44 albums , there have n't been that many really bad ones .
there have been a few mediocre ones , but even those have had good songs on them - compared to any other artist , it 's a fantastic record .
he has maintained a bit of an air of mystery over the years , and when i read chronicles i was amazed by how revealing he was - it was actually quite open .
i think it has been a bit of an interesting phase with the martin scorsese video and chronicles ; it has stoked expectation for the new album .
speaking personally , the words , the songs , the music , have been almost embedded in my stream of consciousness over 40 years .
his work for me is a real touchstone .
it 's almost a true north .

the living legend 's 44th album , modern times , earned five-star reviews in uncut and rolling stone magazines , with the latter calling it a " masterwork " .
the bbc news website asked six dylan fans to explain their enduring fascination with the man and his music .
" he has said enough important things for us to be interested in what he has to say next " katie melua , singer-songwriter " the music , the voice , the lyrics all combined to be something really special for me " bob willis , former england cricketer " dylan seized me in the 60s as nobody else has seized me " christopher ricks , university of oxford professor of poetry " i think we are in a classic dylan era at the moment " stevie jackson , belle and sebastian guitarist " as a teenager the anti-establishment ethos appealed to me " david chaytor mp " his work for me is a real touchstone - it 's almost a true north " sir liam donaldson , chief medical officer for england katie melua , 21 , singer-songwriter georgia-born katie melua has sold more than five million copies of her first two albums , call off the search and piece by piece .
i am a big fan for someone who was n't there - i have discovered him afterwards , without being caught up in the dylan mania that there must have been at the time .
a lot of my friends are fans of dylan - i think it makes him unusual .
with any artist , their core fans are going to be the people of that generation .
i would give anything to be 10 % as good as he is i think he is one of those artists who seems to still capture young people , and i think that mainly is because his voice is of the young , talking of rebellion and talking about politics .
when i listen to masters of war it articulates exactly how i feel about the current situation that is happening today .
i feel like through these songs , especially certain lyrics , he says the stuff that i want current artists to be saying , but they are not .
i go to him to get that fix .
i do n't know anyone within music who is n't either a fan or who does n't respect his work on some level .
i would give anything to be 10 % as good as he is .
i think he has said enough important things for us to be interested in what he has to say next .
i am just quite fascinated to see where he is in his head at the moment .
click here to return to the top bob willis , 57 , former england cricketer bob willis , the former england cricketer and sky sports commentator , says he has just two artists on his ipod - van morrison and dylan .
as a teenager , willis adopted the middle name dylan in the artist 's honour .
a mate of mine , who i was playing football with , handed me bob dylan 's first album -lrb- bob dylan -rrb- which was released in 1962 and after that i was hooked .
bob dylan was singing about furious political issues and getting under the skin of everybody and that 's what appealed to me - the music , the voice , the lyrics all combined to be something really special for me .
it has been a long ride .
there have been trying times along the way - there have been some pretty grim albums - but i have liked most of it .
i am not saying if he started singing nursery rhymes i would rush out and buy the cd , but almost that bad , i think .
he has got to a completely new audience , and i do n't think many artists can say that i got ian botham to a dylan concert in new zealand in 1978 , and he still listens from time to time - there have been a few converts along the way .
the ability of the guy to turn out fantastic lyrics , fantastic rhymes , and then in live performance to reconceive these songs into different interpretations is what 's really appealed to me .
if people go expecting to hear cd recordings , that 's never what they get - he always puts a different slant on the songs .
these days half the audience are under 35 - it really is brilliant to see .
he has got to a completely new audience , and i do n't think many artists can say that they have managed to do that .
the last two albums -lrb- time out of mind and love and theft -rrb- have been some of his best stuff .
the lyrics are still brilliant .
i heard he hired a theatre and did quite a lot of rehearsing for the new album - i am expecting something quite special .
click here to return to the top christopher ricks , 72 university of oxford professor of poetry christopher ricks is professor of humanities at boston university and professor of poetry at oxford .
he has written books about poets including tennyson , milton , keats and ts eliot , and one about a popular musician , dylan 's visions of sin .
dylan seized me in the ' 60s as nobody else has seized me .
i think he is a genius .
i think he is extraordinarily accomplished in the three things that come together to make a song , that is , a voice , a melody of some sort and the words .
i would be very , very surprised if the new album does n't have , as always , some unprecedentedly good songs i had no hostility to the voice from the beginning .
as far as i am concerned , and as far as an enormous number of people are concerned , dylan is nonpareil .
i think it 's like an athlete - a combination of terrific training and discipline , with intuition and instinct .
i think there are concessions that he needs to make with concert performance that for my old ears are too large a price to pay - i wait for the acoustic set .
i hear the subtlety and the nuance more when there is n't the dynamic force of really loud playing .
dylan has been on a so-called " never-ending tour " since the 90s i did n't like the disparagement of everything between blood on the tracks -lrb- 1975 -rrb- and time out of mind -lrb- 1997 -rrb- .
i thought that was really dumb - oh mercy -lrb- 1989 -rrb- had some wonderful songs on it .
i think there are no albums which do n't have any good songs on them .
he has been able to do new things .
-lsb- his autobiography -rsb- chronicles is quite unlike anything he has done - the acclaim that received is very well justified .
it 's a very funny , sad , deeply grateful and fabulous book .
i have deliberately avoided these bootlegs -lsb- of modern times -rsb- that have been circulating .
i do n't know what to expect , but i would be very , very surprised if it does n't have , as always , some unprecedentedly good songs .
click here to return to the top stevie jackson , 37 , belle and sebastian guitarist pop group belle and sebastian referenced guitarist stevie jackson 's musical hero in their song like dylan in the movies .
jackson says their video for the wrong girl also featured him recreating a teenage quest to find a jacket like one worn by dylan .
the first record i ever got hold of , when i was 14 or 15 , was blonde on blonde and it changed my life completely .
the music itself just seemed beyond anything i had been listening to .
the way he looked and the sound of his voice , the words he was saying just seemed so oblique but they just made so much sense .
the clothes he was wearing and the cover - it was like this complete art statement .
what he has produced in the last 10 years has been superb at that point in my life i was pretty obsessive - i was on a quest to find the perfect blonde on blonde jacket .

they have been in talks with london 's mayor over incorporating the caribbean showcase event he set up in hyde park on august bank holiday monday .
this could also involve changing the traditional parade route so that it finishes in the central london park .
about 800,000 revellers attended this year 's carnival and about 20,000 went to the caribbean showcase .
the showcase , which began last year and is aimed at families with young children , has infuriated some organisers who say mayor ken livingstone is trying to undermine the carnival .
mr livingstone has said the narrow streets of notting hill are too cramped and dangerous for the crowds .
future success but now he has approached notting hill carnival limited -lrb- nhcl -rrb- in a bid to co-organise the two events .
a spokesman for the mayor said he welcomed " any opportunity for constructive discussions about how to build on carnival 's success for the future " .
professor chris mullard , chairman of the nhcl , told bbc london : " we have made it very clear to the mayor 's office that we would like to do it , provided the £ 300,000 , which is how much it -lsb- the caribbean showcase -rsb- costs , is in place , and we have complete artistic direction for the whole event .

the event will continue in much the same way as it has done .
" there will be discussions about extending the route , inevitably , because as the numbers increase we will have to look at that . "
police said the 42nd notting hill carnival was largely trouble free .
they made 275 carnival-related arrests over the weekend , mostly for drug-related and public order offences .
organisers said more than 50,000 performers were involved in monday 's event , traditionally the busiest day of carnival .
revellers flocked to the area to watch as a parade of 84 floats , complete with flamboyantly-dressed performers , made its way along a three-and-a-half-mile route through notting hill .
police said at least 300,000 people were on the streets for sunday 's family-orientated children 's day .
event organisers put the figure for sunday at 500,000 .

we have chosen the most passionate , perceptive and persuasive entries for each album , which you can read by clicking on the links below .
on the basis of which argument convinces you the most , vote for which album you would most like to see win the mercury music prize on 5 september .
muse : black holes and revelations " a cornucopia of the best qualities of previous winners wrapped in a well-honed style " zoe rahman : melting pot " the most impressive hair in the jazz business " lou rhodes : beloved one " contemporary british music at its very best " scritti politti : : white bread , black beer " green has returned from the wilderness and made an album seemingly out of the love of music " sway : this is my demo " it demonstrates beyond question that british rap artists can achieve success without mimicking their us predecessors " thom yorke : the eraser " accessible and complicated , beautiful and scary , soulful and inspiring " click here to read reviews of arctic monkeys , isobel campbell , editors , guillemots , richard hawley and hot chip muse by alison young , oxford a cornucopia of the best qualities of previous mercury prize-winners wrapped in a well-honed style , tied with a ribbon of intellectual creativity and decorated with a mobius strip of originality .
muse provide a more convincing and sustainable falsetto than anthony hegarty , more cleverly-crafted rock hooks than franz ferdinand , a unique fusion of musical styles that would have dizzee rascal and talvin singh scratching their heads in disbelief .
orchestration that would entice badly drawn boy 's string section to migrate and a singer with more power and charisma than pj harvey and jarvis cocker combined .
their unique category-defying brand means there 's something for all - fans of rock -lrb- supermassive black hole -rrb- , metal -lrb- assassin -rrb- , cleverly-crafted pop -lrb- starlight -rrb- , dance -lrb- map of the problematique -rrb- , jazz syncopation -lrb- invincible -rrb- , queen-esque tongue-in-cheek harmony -lrb- soldier 's poem -rrb- , romantic piano -lrb- hoodoo -rrb- , mariachi bands -lrb- city of delusion -rrb- and spaghetti westerns -lrb- knights of cydonia -rrb- .
it 's also a pink floyd-esque , conceptual , era-defining album with intelligent lyrics reacting to our 24/7 post-7/7 dis-united kingdom that defies desecration by shuffle play .
it 's the only album i can listen to from start to finish without reaching for the stop button through repetition-induced boredom .
return to the top zoe rahman by rich kirchen , milwaukee zoe rahman is way cool and making jazz hip for younger listeners as opposed to a museum piece .
her first cd was a regular on our home stereo and the new one expands her horizons .
she definitely deserves wider recognition , which the mercury nomination is already providing .
on top of all that , she has the most impressive hair in the jazz business .
return to the top lou rhodes by liz gabriel , london lou rhodes ' beloved one is a glorious , understated album from an incredibly talented singer-songwriter .
there 's more than a little of the faerie queen about rhodes - she has a remarkable voice which is sensual and husky but never sounds saccharine .
she is also a great lyricist who paints intensely personal pictures , from the wistful no rerun which uses chinese violins to great effect , to the more syncopated percussion-rich title track .
rhodes has gathered a group of offbeat , talented musicians who perfectly complement her unique talent .
tender , haunting and funky , it 's contemporary british music at its very best .
return to the top scritti politti by jason parkes , worcester apart from the fact green gartside is an older statesman of popular music behind some of the greatest records since 1978 , i think white bread , black beer should win as it is very now .
the contemporary home-production employed nods to cutting edge r & b on several tracks - the sugababes could have a hit with petrococadollar or the boom boom bap .
green has opted to make the most eclectic album of his career - the diverse blend of genres seem to sum up the similarly diverse approach of the mercury over the years .
he nods to an early love of folk music , while alluding to hip-hop and reggae that have influenced previous records .
most shocking of all is an all-out drift into psychedelia with dr abernathy - a song oasis would lightly maim for !
green has returned from the wilderness , returned to rough trade and made an album seemingly out of a love of music .
this album deserves success and serves as a model for anyone interested in great pop music .
it 's not a work of 80s nostalgia and shows that a 50-year-old can make the sweetest pop .
and would n't it be nice for an older nominee to win ?
return to the top sway by chris keen , cambridge this provides the most convincing argument yet that uk hip-hop is finally making it into the big time .
stepping out of the shadows of his us peers , sway dasafo 's lucid and witty tales of street life impart a uniquely british slant on a distinctly us-dominated genre .
this is my demo is an energetic , refreshing release which deserves recognition not merely on its own musical merits but for the contribution it makes to uk hip-hop and the impact it has had on the scene .
sway 's tongue-in-cheek lyrics are perfectly matched by his own slick production to sonically encapsulate the diverse subject matter this record contends with in a way that few have achieved before .
i believe this album should be recognised as the beginning of a new era in uk hip-hop .
it demonstrates beyond question that british rap artists can achieve success without mimicking their us predecessors - a feat which anyone in the business can not afford to overlook .
return to the top thom yorke by gareth turner , bolton many a talent has been lost when going on solo projects , but this is triumphant .
it oozes radiohead 's best qualities , but this is only the beginning of this album as suddenly it hits you how he has manipulated this sound into something profoundly amicable .
it is accessible and complicated , beautiful and scary , soulful and inspiring - an oxymoronic overdose .
these are the hymns of the twentysomethings , the hymns of the douglas coupland generation x. all hail king thom - but next time bring the others , because i miss them !

we have chosen the most passionate , perceptive and persuasive entries for each album , which you can read by clicking on the links below .
on the basis of which argument convinces you the most , vote for which album you would most like to see win the mercury music prize on 5 september .
muse : black holes and revelations " a cornucopia of the best qualities of previous winners wrapped in a well-honed style " zoe rahman : melting pot " the most impressive hair in the jazz business " lou rhodes : beloved one " contemporary british music at its very best " scritti politti : : white bread , black beer " green has returned from the wilderness and made an album seemingly out of the love of music " sway : this is my demo " it demonstrates beyond question that british rap artists can achieve success without mimicking their us predecessors " thom yorke : the eraser " accessible and complicated , beautiful and scary , soulful and inspiring " click here to read reviews of arctic monkeys , isobel campbell , editors , guillemots , richard hawley and hot chip muse by alison young , oxford a cornucopia of the best qualities of previous mercury prize-winners wrapped in a well-honed style , tied with a ribbon of intellectual creativity and decorated with a mobius strip of originality .
muse provide a more convincing and sustainable falsetto than anthony hegarty , more cleverly-crafted rock hooks than franz ferdinand , a unique fusion of musical styles that would have dizzee rascal and talvin singh scratching their heads in disbelief .
orchestration that would entice badly drawn boy 's string section to migrate and a singer with more power and charisma than pj harvey and jarvis cocker combined .
their unique category-defying brand means there 's something for all - fans of rock -lrb- supermassive black hole -rrb- , metal -lrb- assassin -rrb- , cleverly-crafted pop -lrb- starlight -rrb- , dance -lrb- map of the problematique -rrb- , jazz syncopation -lrb- invincible -rrb- , queen-esque tongue-in-cheek harmony -lrb- soldier 's poem -rrb- , romantic piano -lrb- hoodoo -rrb- , mariachi bands -lrb- city of delusion -rrb- and spaghetti westerns -lrb- knights of cydonia -rrb- .
it 's also a pink floyd-esque , conceptual , era-defining album with intelligent lyrics reacting to our 24/7 post-7/7 dis-united kingdom that defies desecration by shuffle play .
it 's the only album i can listen to from start to finish without reaching for the stop button through repetition-induced boredom .
return to the top zoe rahman by rich kirchen , milwaukee zoe rahman is way cool and making jazz hip for younger listeners as opposed to a museum piece .
her first cd was a regular on our home stereo and the new one expands her horizons .
she definitely deserves wider recognition , which the mercury nomination is already providing .
on top of all that , she has the most impressive hair in the jazz business .
return to the top lou rhodes by liz gabriel , london lou rhodes ' beloved one is a glorious , understated album from an incredibly talented singer-songwriter .
there 's more than a little of the faerie queen about rhodes - she has a remarkable voice which is sensual and husky but never sounds saccharine .
she is also a great lyricist who paints intensely personal pictures , from the wistful no rerun which uses chinese violins to great effect , to the more syncopated percussion-rich title track .
rhodes has gathered a group of offbeat , talented musicians who perfectly complement her unique talent .
tender , haunting and funky , it 's contemporary british music at its very best .
return to the top scritti politti by jason parkes , worcester apart from the fact green gartside is an older statesman of popular music behind some of the greatest records since 1978 , i think white bread , black beer should win as it is very now .
the contemporary home-production employed nods to cutting edge r & b on several tracks - the sugababes could have a hit with petrococadollar or the boom boom bap .
green has opted to make the most eclectic album of his career - the diverse blend of genres seem to sum up the similarly diverse approach of the mercury over the years .
he nods to an early love of folk music , while alluding to hip-hop and reggae that have influenced previous records .
most shocking of all is an all-out drift into psychedelia with dr abernathy - a song oasis would lightly maim for !
green has returned from the wilderness , returned to rough trade and made an album seemingly out of a love of music .
this album deserves success and serves as a model for anyone interested in great pop music .
it 's not a work of 80s nostalgia and shows that a 50-year-old can make the sweetest pop .
and would n't it be nice for an older nominee to win ?
return to the top sway by chris keen , cambridge this provides the most convincing argument yet that uk hip-hop is finally making it into the big time .
stepping out of the shadows of his us peers , sway dasafo 's lucid and witty tales of street life impart a uniquely british slant on a distinctly us-dominated genre .
this is my demo is an energetic , refreshing release which deserves recognition not merely on its own musical merits but for the contribution it makes to uk hip-hop and the impact it has had on the scene .
sway 's tongue-in-cheek lyrics are perfectly matched by his own slick production to sonically encapsulate the diverse subject matter this record contends with in a way that few have achieved before .
i believe this album should be recognised as the beginning of a new era in uk hip-hop .
it demonstrates beyond question that british rap artists can achieve success without mimicking their us predecessors - a feat which anyone in the business can not afford to overlook .
return to the top thom yorke by gareth turner , bolton many a talent has been lost when going on solo projects , but this is triumphant .
it oozes radiohead 's best qualities , but this is only the beginning of this album as suddenly it hits you how he has manipulated this sound into something profoundly amicable .
it is accessible and complicated , beautiful and scary , soulful and inspiring - an oxymoronic overdose .
these are the hymns of the twentysomethings , the hymns of the douglas coupland generation x. all hail king thom - but next time bring the others , because i miss them !
