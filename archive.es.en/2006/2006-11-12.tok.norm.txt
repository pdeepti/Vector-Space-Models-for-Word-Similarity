" the fortwo is n't just a car .

" the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .

the city 's local government wants to introducing a controversial smoking ban that would include not only public buildings , but also all bars and restaurants . the city could go smoke-free as early as january 2007 .
surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray . " i think it 's a very good idea because the places are cleaner and have better air , " he said " the experiences other european countries already have seem to be positive , so why should n't germany join the club ? " germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european countries have already banned smoking " i 'm absolutely in favor of it .
i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .
" it would be better for families and it 's nicer to come home and not smell like a smoker .
we spent our holiday in ireland and they have a smoking ban and it works out there .
and it 's still a great atmosphere in the pubs in ireland . " surprisingly , public opinion is largely in favor of the ban .
according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .
dina , 23 , has been a bartender for two years but has smoked for more than three times as long .
she thinks bars without smoke will make for a very tense night out . " i do n't think a lot of it .
you know , i 'm smoking .
i like to smoke when i go out , " she said . even with broad public support , it 's unclear whether berlin will follow the united states and other european countries before them and give up " the german vice . " in the fashionable bars and restaurants of berlin , it seems that the coolness quotient is inversely proportional to the air quality .
what ’ s even more surprising is that many of these urban hipsters also stockpile all things organic and moan should they miss their daily yoga lesson . the new laws could be the herald of a whole new way of life for germans .

" people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .

it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .

southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .

the city 's local government wants to introducing a controversial smoking ban that would include not only public buildings , but also all bars and restaurants . the city could go smoke-free as early as january 2007 .
surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray . " i think it 's a very good idea because the places are cleaner and have better air , " he said " the experiences other european countries already have seem to be positive , so why should n't germany join the club ? " germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .

german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .

i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .

according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .
despite the fact that paving the land destroys valuable soil , hotels continue to spring up everywhere along the east coast . ecologists warn against making a fast buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irrigation for farming is having a dramatic effect alberto fernandez from the world wildlife fund warns against just thinking about a quick profit .
" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .
" we 're losing the ability to make good agricultural products and we are severely damaging water quality . " the spanish government has developed a plan to examine the affected areas and search for solutions .
and they do n't need to be too complicated , according to ramon vallejo from the center for environment studies in the mediterranean .
" the aim is to halt erosion , " vallejo said .
" for example we are planting bushes native to the area which hold the soil together and protect them with modern technology .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .

" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .

the city 's local government wants to introducing a controversial smoking ban that would include not only public buildings , but also all bars and restaurants . the city could go smoke-free as early as january 2007 .
surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray . " i think it 's a very good idea because the places are cleaner and have better air , " he said " the experiences other european countries already have seem to be positive , so why should n't germany join the club ? " germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european countries have already banned smoking " i 'm absolutely in favor of it .
i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .
" it would be better for families and it 's nicer to come home and not smell like a smoker .
we spent our holiday in ireland and they have a smoking ban and it works out there .

the city 's local government wants to introducing a controversial smoking ban that would include not only public buildings , but also all bars and restaurants . the city could go smoke-free as early as january 2007 .
surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray . " i think it 's a very good idea because the places are cleaner and have better air , " he said " the experiences other european countries already have seem to be positive , so why should n't germany join the club ? " germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european countries have already banned smoking " i 'm absolutely in favor of it .
i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .
" it would be better for families and it 's nicer to come home and not smell like a smoker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 12.11.2006 smart plays last card with revamped fortwo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an icon in an icon : dr. z -lrb- middle -rrb- present the new smart smart , the loss-making ultra-compact car made by daimlerchrysler , has undergone a face-lift in a final attempt to steer itself back to profit . but the second generation of the trendy get-about might be the last if the revamped fortwo fails to drive back into the black after running up heavy losses for its parent company over the past eight years . for the launch of the new fortwo in front of nearly 600 invited journalists to stuttgart on thursday , smart enlisted the help of former formula one driver niki lauda and an impressive firework display . " the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .
despite the fact that paving the land destroys valuable soil , hotels continue to spring up everywhere along the east coast . ecologists warn against making a fast buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irrigation for farming is having a dramatic effect alberto fernandez from the world wildlife fund warns against just thinking about a quick profit .
" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .
" we 're losing the ability to make good agricultural products and we are severely damaging water quality . " the spanish government has developed a plan to examine the affected areas and search for solutions .
and they do n't need to be too complicated , according to ramon vallejo from the center for environment studies in the mediterranean .
" the aim is to halt erosion , " vallejo said .

german international thomas hitzlsperger equalized in the 49th minute , and brazilian forward cacau added another five minutes later . stuttgart , the surprise package of this season , are now top of the table for the first time since october 2004 leading bremen and schalke by one point .
reigning champions bayern munich are four points back in fourth . in sunday 's other game fc nuremberg shared a 1-1 draw with promoted alemannia aachen . the point does neither side any good with both in the bottom half of the table on 14 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice inside 32 minutes for schalke pacesetters werder bremen lost 3-1 against borussia dortmund on friday , and schalke took full advantage with former german international kevin kuranyi and turkish striker halil altintop both scoring a brace to help the gelsenkirchen club join bremen on 23 points . bayern munich also capitalized on bremen 's slip in a thrilling 3-2 win at bayer leverkusen .
reigning champions bayern looked to be heading for their second loss in a week , following their humiliating 1-0 home defeat to hannover , with brazilian athirson putting leverkusen ahead 2-1 in the 80th minute .
however , martin demichelis leveled three minutes later and peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored an 86th minute winner in a thrilling finale .
growing confidence at schalke schalke , out of the uefa cup and the german cup , have pinned all their hopes on the league this season and they go from strength to strength with the latest triumph moving them into second .
the game was wrapped up by half-time with kuranyi scoring twice inside 32 minutes while altintop was also on target after a brilliant 70 meter run from brazilian full back rafinha gave him a tap-in .
altintop 's delicate chip for his second goal reflected the growing confidence in the schalke camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salihamidzic 's opener only allowed for brief jubilation bayern found it tougher going in their see-saw match at leverkusen with stefan kiessling cancelling out the 33rd minute opener from hasan salihamidzic .
athirson then put leverkusen in front with just 10 minutes left , but bayern showed the spirit of champions to score twice in the next six minutes to claim the spoils .
more bad news for hamburg at the wrong end of the table sv hamburg manager thomas doll was left seething as his team drew 1-1 with borussia monchengladbach .
danijel ljuboja scored on 66 minutes to put hamburg ahead , but oliver neuville equalized six minutes from time . it was doll 's 100th game in charge and prior to the game there was speculation that defeat against gladbach , who had lost all their other away matches , would cost him his job . a draw leaves hamburg fourth from bottom and doll 's future remains unclear . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vfb stuttgart : from mediocre to meteoric stuttgart have recovered from last year 's failed experiments and risen to second place in the league .

" germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .

we spent our holiday in ireland and they have a smoking ban and it works out there .
and it 's still a great atmosphere in the pubs in ireland . " surprisingly , public opinion is largely in favor of the ban .
according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .

she thinks bars without smoke will make for a very tense night out . " i do n't think a lot of it .
you know , i 'm smoking .
i like to smoke when i go out , " she said . even with broad public support , it 's unclear whether berlin will follow the united states and other european countries before them and give up " the german vice . " in the fashionable bars and restaurants of berlin , it seems that the coolness quotient is inversely proportional to the air quality .
what ’ s even more surprising is that many of these urban hipsters also stockpile all things organic and moan should they miss their daily yoga lesson . the new laws could be the herald of a whole new way of life for germans .

and it 's still a great atmosphere in the pubs in ireland . " surprisingly , public opinion is largely in favor of the ban .
according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .
dina , 23 , has been a bartender for two years but has smoked for more than three times as long .
she thinks bars without smoke will make for a very tense night out . " i do n't think a lot of it .
you know , i 'm smoking .
i like to smoke when i go out , " she said . even with broad public support , it 's unclear whether berlin will follow the united states and other european countries before them and give up " the german vice . " in the fashionable bars and restaurants of berlin , it seems that the coolness quotient is inversely proportional to the air quality .
what ’ s even more surprising is that many of these urban hipsters also stockpile all things organic and moan should they miss their daily yoga lesson . the new laws could be the herald of a whole new way of life for germans .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .

and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .

" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .

and they do n't need to be too complicated , according to ramon vallejo from the center for environment studies in the mediterranean .

" the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .

the city 's local government wants to introducing a controversial smoking ban that would include not only public buildings , but also all bars and restaurants . the city could go smoke-free as early as january 2007 .
surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray . " i think it 's a very good idea because the places are cleaner and have better air , " he said " the experiences other european countries already have seem to be positive , so why should n't germany join the club ? " germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european countries have already banned smoking " i 'm absolutely in favor of it .
i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .
" it would be better for families and it 's nicer to come home and not smell like a smoker .
we spent our holiday in ireland and they have a smoking ban and it works out there .
and it 's still a great atmosphere in the pubs in ireland . " surprisingly , public opinion is largely in favor of the ban .
according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .
dina , 23 , has been a bartender for two years but has smoked for more than three times as long .
she thinks bars without smoke will make for a very tense night out . " i do n't think a lot of it .
you know , i 'm smoking .
i like to smoke when i go out , " she said . even with broad public support , it 's unclear whether berlin will follow the united states and other european countries before them and give up " the german vice . " in the fashionable bars and restaurants of berlin , it seems that the coolness quotient is inversely proportional to the air quality .
what ’ s even more surprising is that many of these urban hipsters also stockpile all things organic and moan should they miss their daily yoga lesson . the new laws could be the herald of a whole new way of life for germans .

9 , 2009 . ever since berlin 's famous landmark was dismantled in 1989 , the berlin authorities have been in a quandary over the most suitable way of remembering the oppressive , grey 155-kilometer-long -lrb- around 96 miles -rrb- barrier , which not only sliced the city in half but also surrounded its western border for nearly 30 years , between 1961 and 1989 . " people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one memorial to those who died " the lights will illuminate the spot where the wall once stood , as well as the immediate border area .

the spectacular east side gallery stretch of wall , which was illustrated by a host of german and foreign artists in 1989-90 , runs along the water in the eastern friedrichshain district .
but this site was never part of the original barrier , serving only as a secondary barrier . tourists want to see more ever since the wall was torn down in 1989-90 , foreign tourists visiting berlin have complained that they have trouble finding any trace of the barrier , which caused so much misery for the berliners during the cold war era and led to many people being killed trying to flee to the west .

german international thomas hitzlsperger equalized in the 49th minute , and brazilian forward cacau added another five minutes later . stuttgart , the surprise package of this season , are now top of the table for the first time since october 2004 leading bremen and schalke by one point .
reigning champions bayern munich are four points back in fourth . in sunday 's other game fc nuremberg shared a 1-1 draw with promoted alemannia aachen . the point does neither side any good with both in the bottom half of the table on 14 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice inside 32 minutes for schalke pacesetters werder bremen lost 3-1 against borussia dortmund on friday , and schalke took full advantage with former german international kevin kuranyi and turkish striker halil altintop both scoring a brace to help the gelsenkirchen club join bremen on 23 points . bayern munich also capitalized on bremen 's slip in a thrilling 3-2 win at bayer leverkusen .
reigning champions bayern looked to be heading for their second loss in a week , following their humiliating 1-0 home defeat to hannover , with brazilian athirson putting leverkusen ahead 2-1 in the 80th minute .
however , martin demichelis leveled three minutes later and peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored an 86th minute winner in a thrilling finale .
growing confidence at schalke schalke , out of the uefa cup and the german cup , have pinned all their hopes on the league this season and they go from strength to strength with the latest triumph moving them into second .
the game was wrapped up by half-time with kuranyi scoring twice inside 32 minutes while altintop was also on target after a brilliant 70 meter run from brazilian full back rafinha gave him a tap-in .
altintop 's delicate chip for his second goal reflected the growing confidence in the schalke camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salihamidzic 's opener only allowed for brief jubilation bayern found it tougher going in their see-saw match at leverkusen with stefan kiessling cancelling out the 33rd minute opener from hasan salihamidzic .
athirson then put leverkusen in front with just 10 minutes left , but bayern showed the spirit of champions to score twice in the next six minutes to claim the spoils .
more bad news for hamburg at the wrong end of the table sv hamburg manager thomas doll was left seething as his team drew 1-1 with borussia monchengladbach .
danijel ljuboja scored on 66 minutes to put hamburg ahead , but oliver neuville equalized six minutes from time . it was doll 's 100th game in charge and prior to the game there was speculation that defeat against gladbach , who had lost all their other away matches , would cost him his job . a draw leaves hamburg fourth from bottom and doll 's future remains unclear . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vfb stuttgart : from mediocre to meteoric stuttgart have recovered from last year 's failed experiments and risen to second place in the league .

9 , 2009 . ever since berlin 's famous landmark was dismantled in 1989 , the berlin authorities have been in a quandary over the most suitable way of remembering the oppressive , grey 155-kilometer-long -lrb- around 96 miles -rrb- barrier , which not only sliced the city in half but also surrounded its western border for nearly 30 years , between 1961 and 1989 . " people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one memorial to those who died " the lights will illuminate the spot where the wall once stood , as well as the immediate border area .
on roads that now link east-west berlin , narrow strips of light at a height of 3.6 meters and at ground level will show the route of the wall , " buecke said . interactive art with meaning dirks said the group project would not be an isolated art happening . " the idea is that it should be harnessed to the overall concept of events linked to the wall 's 20th anniversary , " dirks said . pastor manfred fischer , chairman of the city 's bernauerstrasse wall memorial site , said berlin is the right location for the " wall of light " idea .
the project is expected to cost 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.54 million -rrb- if realized and run for six weeks , starting nov .
9 , 2009 , if approved by the city government . reiner klemke , a berlin city government culture official , said it was an interesting and realistic art project , but warned that it must in no way be a " glorification of the wall . " few wall memorials exist plans relating to the wall of light project are currently being displayed at an exhibition called " city of transformation , city of ideas , " at the galerie aedes in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some segments of the wall are still standing few wall remnants remain .
one exception , along with an east berlin watchtower , stands at the old checkpoint charlie crossing point among a conglomeration of new office blocks designed by american architects .
other segments of the wall are situated near the gropiusbau museum in berlin 's mitte district .

german international thomas hitzlsperger equalized in the 49th minute , and brazilian forward cacau added another five minutes later . stuttgart , the surprise package of this season , are now top of the table for the first time since october 2004 leading bremen and schalke by one point .

reigning champions bayern looked to be heading for their second loss in a week , following their humiliating 1-0 home defeat to hannover , with brazilian athirson putting leverkusen ahead 2-1 in the 80th minute .
however , martin demichelis leveled three minutes later and peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored an 86th minute winner in a thrilling finale .
growing confidence at schalke schalke , out of the uefa cup and the german cup , have pinned all their hopes on the league this season and they go from strength to strength with the latest triumph moving them into second .
the game was wrapped up by half-time with kuranyi scoring twice inside 32 minutes while altintop was also on target after a brilliant 70 meter run from brazilian full back rafinha gave him a tap-in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 12.11.2006 smart plays last card with revamped fortwo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an icon in an icon : dr. z -lrb- middle -rrb- present the new smart smart , the loss-making ultra-compact car made by daimlerchrysler , has undergone a face-lift in a final attempt to steer itself back to profit . but the second generation of the trendy get-about might be the last if the revamped fortwo fails to drive back into the black after running up heavy losses for its parent company over the past eight years . for the launch of the new fortwo in front of nearly 600 invited journalists to stuttgart on thursday , smart enlisted the help of former formula one driver niki lauda and an impressive firework display . " the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .
despite the fact that paving the land destroys valuable soil , hotels continue to spring up everywhere along the east coast . ecologists warn against making a fast buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irrigation for farming is having a dramatic effect alberto fernandez from the world wildlife fund warns against just thinking about a quick profit .
" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .
" we 're losing the ability to make good agricultural products and we are severely damaging water quality . " the spanish government has developed a plan to examine the affected areas and search for solutions .
and they do n't need to be too complicated , according to ramon vallejo from the center for environment studies in the mediterranean .
" the aim is to halt erosion , " vallejo said .
" for example we are planting bushes native to the area which hold the soil together and protect them with modern technology .

german international thomas hitzlsperger equalized in the 49th minute , and brazilian forward cacau added another five minutes later . stuttgart , the surprise package of this season , are now top of the table for the first time since october 2004 leading bremen and schalke by one point .
reigning champions bayern munich are four points back in fourth . in sunday 's other game fc nuremberg shared a 1-1 draw with promoted alemannia aachen . the point does neither side any good with both in the bottom half of the table on 14 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice inside 32 minutes for schalke pacesetters werder bremen lost 3-1 against borussia dortmund on friday , and schalke took full advantage with former german international kevin kuranyi and turkish striker halil altintop both scoring a brace to help the gelsenkirchen club join bremen on 23 points . bayern munich also capitalized on bremen 's slip in a thrilling 3-2 win at bayer leverkusen .
reigning champions bayern looked to be heading for their second loss in a week , following their humiliating 1-0 home defeat to hannover , with brazilian athirson putting leverkusen ahead 2-1 in the 80th minute .
however , martin demichelis leveled three minutes later and peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored an 86th minute winner in a thrilling finale .
growing confidence at schalke schalke , out of the uefa cup and the german cup , have pinned all their hopes on the league this season and they go from strength to strength with the latest triumph moving them into second .
the game was wrapped up by half-time with kuranyi scoring twice inside 32 minutes while altintop was also on target after a brilliant 70 meter run from brazilian full back rafinha gave him a tap-in .
altintop 's delicate chip for his second goal reflected the growing confidence in the schalke camp .

more bad news for hamburg at the wrong end of the table sv hamburg manager thomas doll was left seething as his team drew 1-1 with borussia monchengladbach .
danijel ljuboja scored on 66 minutes to put hamburg ahead , but oliver neuville equalized six minutes from time . it was doll 's 100th game in charge and prior to the game there was speculation that defeat against gladbach , who had lost all their other away matches , would cost him his job . a draw leaves hamburg fourth from bottom and doll 's future remains unclear . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vfb stuttgart : from mediocre to meteoric stuttgart have recovered from last year 's failed experiments and risen to second place in the league .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .
despite the fact that paving the land destroys valuable soil , hotels continue to spring up everywhere along the east coast . ecologists warn against making a fast buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irrigation for farming is having a dramatic effect alberto fernandez from the world wildlife fund warns against just thinking about a quick profit .
" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .
" we 're losing the ability to make good agricultural products and we are severely damaging water quality . " the spanish government has developed a plan to examine the affected areas and search for solutions .
and they do n't need to be too complicated , according to ramon vallejo from the center for environment studies in the mediterranean .
" the aim is to halt erosion , " vallejo said .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .

surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray .

" germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european countries have already banned smoking " i 'm absolutely in favor of it .

we spent our holiday in ireland and they have a smoking ban and it works out there .

according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .

" the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .

one exception , along with an east berlin watchtower , stands at the old checkpoint charlie crossing point among a conglomeration of new office blocks designed by american architects .
other segments of the wall are situated near the gropiusbau museum in berlin 's mitte district .
the spectacular east side gallery stretch of wall , which was illustrated by a host of german and foreign artists in 1989-90 , runs along the water in the eastern friedrichshain district .
but this site was never part of the original barrier , serving only as a secondary barrier . tourists want to see more ever since the wall was torn down in 1989-90 , foreign tourists visiting berlin have complained that they have trouble finding any trace of the barrier , which caused so much misery for the berliners during the cold war era and led to many people being killed trying to flee to the west .

the project is expected to cost 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.54 million -rrb- if realized and run for six weeks , starting nov .
9 , 2009 , if approved by the city government . reiner klemke , a berlin city government culture official , said it was an interesting and realistic art project , but warned that it must in no way be a " glorification of the wall .

one exception , along with an east berlin watchtower , stands at the old checkpoint charlie crossing point among a conglomeration of new office blocks designed by american architects .
other segments of the wall are situated near the gropiusbau museum in berlin 's mitte district .
the spectacular east side gallery stretch of wall , which was illustrated by a host of german and foreign artists in 1989-90 , runs along the water in the eastern friedrichshain district .
but this site was never part of the original barrier , serving only as a secondary barrier . tourists want to see more ever since the wall was torn down in 1989-90 , foreign tourists visiting berlin have complained that they have trouble finding any trace of the barrier , which caused so much misery for the berliners during the cold war era and led to many people being killed trying to flee to the west .

german international thomas hitzlsperger equalized in the 49th minute , and brazilian forward cacau added another five minutes later . stuttgart , the surprise package of this season , are now top of the table for the first time since october 2004 leading bremen and schalke by one point .
reigning champions bayern munich are four points back in fourth . in sunday 's other game fc nuremberg shared a 1-1 draw with promoted alemannia aachen . the point does neither side any good with both in the bottom half of the table on 14 points .

reigning champions bayern looked to be heading for their second loss in a week , following their humiliating 1-0 home defeat to hannover , with brazilian athirson putting leverkusen ahead 2-1 in the 80th minute .
however , martin demichelis leveled three minutes later and peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored an 86th minute winner in a thrilling finale .
growing confidence at schalke schalke , out of the uefa cup and the german cup , have pinned all their hopes on the league this season and they go from strength to strength with the latest triumph moving them into second .
the game was wrapped up by half-time with kuranyi scoring twice inside 32 minutes while altintop was also on target after a brilliant 70 meter run from brazilian full back rafinha gave him a tap-in .

" the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .
despite the fact that paving the land destroys valuable soil , hotels continue to spring up everywhere along the east coast . ecologists warn against making a fast buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irrigation for farming is having a dramatic effect alberto fernandez from the world wildlife fund warns against just thinking about a quick profit .
" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .
" we 're losing the ability to make good agricultural products and we are severely damaging water quality . " the spanish government has developed a plan to examine the affected areas and search for solutions .
and they do n't need to be too complicated , according to ramon vallejo from the center for environment studies in the mediterranean .
" the aim is to halt erosion , " vallejo said .
" for example we are planting bushes native to the area which hold the soil together and protect them with modern technology .

german international thomas hitzlsperger equalized in the 49th minute , and brazilian forward cacau added another five minutes later . stuttgart , the surprise package of this season , are now top of the table for the first time since october 2004 leading bremen and schalke by one point .
reigning champions bayern munich are four points back in fourth . in sunday 's other game fc nuremberg shared a 1-1 draw with promoted alemannia aachen . the point does neither side any good with both in the bottom half of the table on 14 points .

reigning champions bayern looked to be heading for their second loss in a week , following their humiliating 1-0 home defeat to hannover , with brazilian athirson putting leverkusen ahead 2-1 in the 80th minute .
however , martin demichelis leveled three minutes later and peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored an 86th minute winner in a thrilling finale .
growing confidence at schalke schalke , out of the uefa cup and the german cup , have pinned all their hopes on the league this season and they go from strength to strength with the latest triumph moving them into second .
the game was wrapped up by half-time with kuranyi scoring twice inside 32 minutes while altintop was also on target after a brilliant 70 meter run from brazilian full back rafinha gave him a tap-in .
altintop 's delicate chip for his second goal reflected the growing confidence in the schalke camp .

the city 's local government wants to introducing a controversial smoking ban that would include not only public buildings , but also all bars and restaurants . the city could go smoke-free as early as january 2007 .
surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray . " i think it 's a very good idea because the places are cleaner and have better air , " he said " the experiences other european countries already have seem to be positive , so why should n't germany join the club ? " germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european countries have already banned smoking " i 'm absolutely in favor of it .
i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .
" it would be better for families and it 's nicer to come home and not smell like a smoker .
we spent our holiday in ireland and they have a smoking ban and it works out there .
and it 's still a great atmosphere in the pubs in ireland . " surprisingly , public opinion is largely in favor of the ban .
according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .
dina , 23 , has been a bartender for two years but has smoked for more than three times as long .
she thinks bars without smoke will make for a very tense night out . " i do n't think a lot of it .
you know , i 'm smoking .
i like to smoke when i go out , " she said . even with broad public support , it 's unclear whether berlin will follow the united states and other european countries before them and give up " the german vice . " in the fashionable bars and restaurants of berlin , it seems that the coolness quotient is inversely proportional to the air quality .
what ’ s even more surprising is that many of these urban hipsters also stockpile all things organic and moan should they miss their daily yoga lesson . the new laws could be the herald of a whole new way of life for germans .
but do n't hold your breath . michelle hennery -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany dumps tobacco advertising to comply with eu the german parliament has voted to ban nearly all tobacco advertising to comply with european union mandates .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .
despite the fact that paving the land destroys valuable soil , hotels continue to spring up everywhere along the east coast . ecologists warn against making a fast buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irrigation for farming is having a dramatic effect alberto fernandez from the world wildlife fund warns against just thinking about a quick profit .
" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .
" we 're losing the ability to make good agricultural products and we are severely damaging water quality . " the spanish government has developed a plan to examine the affected areas and search for solutions .
and they do n't need to be too complicated , according to ramon vallejo from the center for environment studies in the mediterranean .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .
despite the fact that paving the land destroys valuable soil , hotels continue to spring up everywhere along the east coast . ecologists warn against making a fast buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irrigation for farming is having a dramatic effect alberto fernandez from the world wildlife fund warns against just thinking about a quick profit .
" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .
" we 're losing the ability to make good agricultural products and we are severely damaging water quality . " the spanish government has developed a plan to examine the affected areas and search for solutions .
and they do n't need to be too complicated , according to ramon vallejo from the center for environment studies in the mediterranean .

germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .

according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit .

surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray .

" germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .

" the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .
the latest replica , an electric smart car set enter the market soon , has stirred up legal controversy in europe .
-lrb- 16.10.2006 -rrb- daimler-chrysler 's " dr. z " becomes icon despite massive losses despite becoming a cult tv star in the us , daimlerchrysler 's chairman dieter zetsche could n't stop the automotive giant from posting massive third quarter losses in september .
-lrb- 26.09.2006 -rrb- tiny smart car to challenge giants in us market daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle .

" people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .
despite the fact that paving the land destroys valuable soil , hotels continue to spring up everywhere along the east coast . ecologists warn against making a fast buck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irrigation for farming is having a dramatic effect alberto fernandez from the world wildlife fund warns against just thinking about a quick profit .
" we are losing natural treasures , " said fernandez .
" we 're losing the ability to make good agricultural products and we are severely damaging water quality . " the spanish government has developed a plan to examine the affected areas and search for solutions .
and they do n't need to be too complicated , according to ramon vallejo from the center for environment studies in the mediterranean .
" the aim is to halt erosion , " vallejo said .
" for example we are planting bushes native to the area which hold the soil together and protect them with modern technology .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .

i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .
" it would be better for families and it 's nicer to come home and not smell like a smoker .

according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .

" the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .

" people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .

the city 's local government wants to introducing a controversial smoking ban that would include not only public buildings , but also all bars and restaurants . the city could go smoke-free as early as january 2007 .
surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray . " i think it 's a very good idea because the places are cleaner and have better air , " he said " the experiences other european countries already have seem to be positive , so why should n't germany join the club ? " germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european countries have already banned smoking " i 'm absolutely in favor of it .
i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .
" it would be better for families and it 's nicer to come home and not smell like a smoker .
we spent our holiday in ireland and they have a smoking ban and it works out there .
and it 's still a great atmosphere in the pubs in ireland . " surprisingly , public opinion is largely in favor of the ban .
according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .
dina , 23 , has been a bartender for two years but has smoked for more than three times as long .
she thinks bars without smoke will make for a very tense night out . " i do n't think a lot of it .
you know , i 'm smoking .
i like to smoke when i go out , " she said . even with broad public support , it 's unclear whether berlin will follow the united states and other european countries before them and give up " the german vice . " in the fashionable bars and restaurants of berlin , it seems that the coolness quotient is inversely proportional to the air quality .
what ’ s even more surprising is that many of these urban hipsters also stockpile all things organic and moan should they miss their daily yoga lesson . the new laws could be the herald of a whole new way of life for germans .

more anti-smoking legislation is on the horizon .
-lrb- 10.11.2006 -rrb- berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country .

german international thomas hitzlsperger equalized in the 49th minute , and brazilian forward cacau added another five minutes later . stuttgart , the surprise package of this season , are now top of the table for the first time since october 2004 leading bremen and schalke by one point .
reigning champions bayern munich are four points back in fourth . in sunday 's other game fc nuremberg shared a 1-1 draw with promoted alemannia aachen . the point does neither side any good with both in the bottom half of the table on 14 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice inside 32 minutes for schalke pacesetters werder bremen lost 3-1 against borussia dortmund on friday , and schalke took full advantage with former german international kevin kuranyi and turkish striker halil altintop both scoring a brace to help the gelsenkirchen club join bremen on 23 points . bayern munich also capitalized on bremen 's slip in a thrilling 3-2 win at bayer leverkusen .
reigning champions bayern looked to be heading for their second loss in a week , following their humiliating 1-0 home defeat to hannover , with brazilian athirson putting leverkusen ahead 2-1 in the 80th minute .
however , martin demichelis leveled three minutes later and peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored an 86th minute winner in a thrilling finale .
growing confidence at schalke schalke , out of the uefa cup and the german cup , have pinned all their hopes on the league this season and they go from strength to strength with the latest triumph moving them into second .
the game was wrapped up by half-time with kuranyi scoring twice inside 32 minutes while altintop was also on target after a brilliant 70 meter run from brazilian full back rafinha gave him a tap-in .

danijel ljuboja scored on 66 minutes to put hamburg ahead , but oliver neuville equalized six minutes from time . it was doll 's 100th game in charge and prior to the game there was speculation that defeat against gladbach , who had lost all their other away matches , would cost him his job . a draw leaves hamburg fourth from bottom and doll 's future remains unclear . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vfb stuttgart : from mediocre to meteoric stuttgart have recovered from last year 's failed experiments and risen to second place in the league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 12.11.2006 smart plays last card with revamped fortwo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an icon in an icon : dr. z -lrb- middle -rrb- present the new smart smart , the loss-making ultra-compact car made by daimlerchrysler , has undergone a face-lift in a final attempt to steer itself back to profit . but the second generation of the trendy get-about might be the last if the revamped fortwo fails to drive back into the black after running up heavy losses for its parent company over the past eight years . for the launch of the new fortwo in front of nearly 600 invited journalists to stuttgart on thursday , smart enlisted the help of former formula one driver niki lauda and an impressive firework display . " the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .
the latest replica , an electric smart car set enter the market soon , has stirred up legal controversy in europe .
-lrb- 16.10.2006 -rrb- daimler-chrysler 's " dr. z " becomes icon despite massive losses despite becoming a cult tv star in the us , daimlerchrysler 's chairman dieter zetsche could n't stop the automotive giant from posting massive third quarter losses in september .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .

southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .

" dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .

9 , 2009 . ever since berlin 's famous landmark was dismantled in 1989 , the berlin authorities have been in a quandary over the most suitable way of remembering the oppressive , grey 155-kilometer-long -lrb- around 96 miles -rrb- barrier , which not only sliced the city in half but also surrounded its western border for nearly 30 years , between 1961 and 1989 . " people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one memorial to those who died " the lights will illuminate the spot where the wall once stood , as well as the immediate border area .
on roads that now link east-west berlin , narrow strips of light at a height of 3.6 meters and at ground level will show the route of the wall , " buecke said . interactive art with meaning dirks said the group project would not be an isolated art happening . " the idea is that it should be harnessed to the overall concept of events linked to the wall 's 20th anniversary , " dirks said . pastor manfred fischer , chairman of the city 's bernauerstrasse wall memorial site , said berlin is the right location for the " wall of light " idea .
the project is expected to cost 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.54 million -rrb- if realized and run for six weeks , starting nov .
9 , 2009 , if approved by the city government . reiner klemke , a berlin city government culture official , said it was an interesting and realistic art project , but warned that it must in no way be a " glorification of the wall . " few wall memorials exist plans relating to the wall of light project are currently being displayed at an exhibition called " city of transformation , city of ideas , " at the galerie aedes in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some segments of the wall are still standing few wall remnants remain .
one exception , along with an east berlin watchtower , stands at the old checkpoint charlie crossing point among a conglomeration of new office blocks designed by american architects .
other segments of the wall are situated near the gropiusbau museum in berlin 's mitte district .
the spectacular east side gallery stretch of wall , which was illustrated by a host of german and foreign artists in 1989-90 , runs along the water in the eastern friedrichshain district .
but this site was never part of the original barrier , serving only as a secondary barrier . tourists want to see more ever since the wall was torn down in 1989-90 , foreign tourists visiting berlin have complained that they have trouble finding any trace of the barrier , which caused so much misery for the berliners during the cold war era and led to many people being killed trying to flee to the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragments of the wall are sold as souvenirs the city 's main wall memorial site is at bernauerstrasse , a city street cut in half by the border and where , after the construction of the barrier , desperate east berliners tried jumping to the western side from houses backing on to the west . but its location is some distance from the city center , leading sometimes to it being overlooked by tourists . events marking the 17th anniversary of the wall 's 1989 demise were held in berlin thursday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 12.11.2006 smart plays last card with revamped fortwo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an icon in an icon : dr. z -lrb- middle -rrb- present the new smart smart , the loss-making ultra-compact car made by daimlerchrysler , has undergone a face-lift in a final attempt to steer itself back to profit . but the second generation of the trendy get-about might be the last if the revamped fortwo fails to drive back into the black after running up heavy losses for its parent company over the past eight years . for the launch of the new fortwo in front of nearly 600 invited journalists to stuttgart on thursday , smart enlisted the help of former formula one driver niki lauda and an impressive firework display . " the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .

9 , 2009 . ever since berlin 's famous landmark was dismantled in 1989 , the berlin authorities have been in a quandary over the most suitable way of remembering the oppressive , grey 155-kilometer-long -lrb- around 96 miles -rrb- barrier , which not only sliced the city in half but also surrounded its western border for nearly 30 years , between 1961 and 1989 . " people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one memorial to those who died " the lights will illuminate the spot where the wall once stood , as well as the immediate border area .
on roads that now link east-west berlin , narrow strips of light at a height of 3.6 meters and at ground level will show the route of the wall , " buecke said . interactive art with meaning dirks said the group project would not be an isolated art happening . " the idea is that it should be harnessed to the overall concept of events linked to the wall 's 20th anniversary , " dirks said . pastor manfred fischer , chairman of the city 's bernauerstrasse wall memorial site , said berlin is the right location for the " wall of light " idea .
the project is expected to cost 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.54 million -rrb- if realized and run for six weeks , starting nov .
9 , 2009 , if approved by the city government . reiner klemke , a berlin city government culture official , said it was an interesting and realistic art project , but warned that it must in no way be a " glorification of the wall . " few wall memorials exist plans relating to the wall of light project are currently being displayed at an exhibition called " city of transformation , city of ideas , " at the galerie aedes in berlin .

one exception , along with an east berlin watchtower , stands at the old checkpoint charlie crossing point among a conglomeration of new office blocks designed by american architects .
other segments of the wall are situated near the gropiusbau museum in berlin 's mitte district .
the spectacular east side gallery stretch of wall , which was illustrated by a host of german and foreign artists in 1989-90 , runs along the water in the eastern friedrichshain district .
but this site was never part of the original barrier , serving only as a secondary barrier . tourists want to see more ever since the wall was torn down in 1989-90 , foreign tourists visiting berlin have complained that they have trouble finding any trace of the barrier , which caused so much misery for the berliners during the cold war era and led to many people being killed trying to flee to the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragments of the wall are sold as souvenirs the city 's main wall memorial site is at bernauerstrasse , a city street cut in half by the border and where , after the construction of the barrier , desperate east berliners tried jumping to the western side from houses backing on to the west . but its location is some distance from the city center , leading sometimes to it being overlooked by tourists . events marking the 17th anniversary of the wall 's 1989 demise were held in berlin thursday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

9 , 2009 . ever since berlin 's famous landmark was dismantled in 1989 , the berlin authorities have been in a quandary over the most suitable way of remembering the oppressive , grey 155-kilometer-long -lrb- around 96 miles -rrb- barrier , which not only sliced the city in half but also surrounded its western border for nearly 30 years , between 1961 and 1989 . " people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one memorial to those who died " the lights will illuminate the spot where the wall once stood , as well as the immediate border area .
on roads that now link east-west berlin , narrow strips of light at a height of 3.6 meters and at ground level will show the route of the wall , " buecke said . interactive art with meaning dirks said the group project would not be an isolated art happening . " the idea is that it should be harnessed to the overall concept of events linked to the wall 's 20th anniversary , " dirks said . pastor manfred fischer , chairman of the city 's bernauerstrasse wall memorial site , said berlin is the right location for the " wall of light " idea .
the project is expected to cost 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.54 million -rrb- if realized and run for six weeks , starting nov .
9 , 2009 , if approved by the city government . reiner klemke , a berlin city government culture official , said it was an interesting and realistic art project , but warned that it must in no way be a " glorification of the wall . " few wall memorials exist plans relating to the wall of light project are currently being displayed at an exhibition called " city of transformation , city of ideas , " at the galerie aedes in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some segments of the wall are still standing few wall remnants remain .
one exception , along with an east berlin watchtower , stands at the old checkpoint charlie crossing point among a conglomeration of new office blocks designed by american architects .
other segments of the wall are situated near the gropiusbau museum in berlin 's mitte district .
the spectacular east side gallery stretch of wall , which was illustrated by a host of german and foreign artists in 1989-90 , runs along the water in the eastern friedrichshain district .
but this site was never part of the original barrier , serving only as a secondary barrier . tourists want to see more ever since the wall was torn down in 1989-90 , foreign tourists visiting berlin have complained that they have trouble finding any trace of the barrier , which caused so much misery for the berliners during the cold war era and led to many people being killed trying to flee to the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragments of the wall are sold as souvenirs the city 's main wall memorial site is at bernauerstrasse , a city street cut in half by the border and where , after the construction of the barrier , desperate east berliners tried jumping to the western side from houses backing on to the west . but its location is some distance from the city center , leading sometimes to it being overlooked by tourists . events marking the 17th anniversary of the wall 's 1989 demise were held in berlin thursday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

" the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.11.2006 spain fights back on europe 's desertification front line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spain of the future ?
parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .
" soil is a living entity , " said rubio .
" it is the earth 's skin and is very sensitive to temperature changes or lack of moisture . " dry periods and rain leads to erosion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intense sun and torrential rain destroys the spanish soil the environment is finding it ever more difficult to recover from the effects of long dry periods and devastating forest fires .
and when it does actually rain , the water washes away the last nutrients from the soil and erosion becomes almost unstoppable . but the desertification is not just down to climate change .
southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .
" i believe that people must be calling this the ' garden of europe ' for a reason , " said hortelano .
" it 's because of our products and climate .
our peaches are famous in all europe - because of their quality . " water in spain stands for rural development - something which is vital to everyone .

parts of the iberian peninsula could turn to desert without action did you know that if you turn off the tap while cleaning your teeth , you can save 12 liters -lrb- 3 gallons -rrb- of water ?
it 's old news to most people in spain whose government has launched a campaign to fight desertification . officials on the iberian peninsula are leading europe 's charge in the fight against global warming and are pulling out all the stops to get people to save water in a region increasingly under threat . the desert is on the march in spain .
around 6 percent of the iberian peninsula has been lost to the wilderness forever , and a third of all arable land is seriously threatened .
one of the worst affected regions is the southern spanish province of malaga , which is losing two centimeters -lrb- almost one inch -rrb- of valuable land every year .
what is happening in malaga could be the fate of much of spain and other parts of southern europe if desertification is not arrested . as complicated as the consequences may be , the cause is really quite simple , according to jose luis rubio , president of the european society for soil conservation : the problem is not taken seriously enough .

southern spain provides the european market with millions of tons of fruit and vegetables and that makes the land ever thirstier . the world wildlife fund estimates that 115 liters -lrb- over 30 gallons -rrb- of water are used to produce just two pounds -lrb- nearly one kilo -rrb- of strawberries .
but the president of a fruit cooperative in the murcia region , jose marin hortelano , feels it is small price to pay .

" the fortwo is n't just a car .
it 's an icon , " said daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche .
" the new smart does everything that customers have liked about this car from the very beginning .
but it does it better . " at first glance , the smart mark ii , which like is predecessor is built at the french assembly plant in hambach in the mosel valley , looks almost exactly the same .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new smart is 17 cm longer than this old one but comfort has been increased , by making the new model , which will be in the salesrooms from next april , 17 centimeters -lrb- almost seven inches -rrb- longer .
even at that length , drivers will still be able to park at right angles to the pavement , the makers claim , one of the big selling points in the traffic-jammed towns and cities where parking space is in chronically short supply . there are changes under the hood , too , with the engine 10-15 percent more powerful , but just as low in carbon dioxide emissions - 90 grams per kilometer , compared with 113 grams for the peugeot 206 and 120 grams for the renault twingo .
ambitious targets for a model that has never yet made a profit , parent company daimlerchrysler has set the new smart ambitious targets : to break even by next year and turn in a profit in subsequent years . but there lies the crux of the problem .
even though 750,000 smart cars have been sold worldwide since the brand 's launch in 1998 , sales have fallen short of target given the relatively high starting price of 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12,150 -rrb- for a basic two-seater . daimlerchrysler does not publish separate earnings figures for its different brands .
but analysts estimate the smart has run up accumulated losses of more than three billion euros since the launch , a figure dismissed as " pure speculation " by smart chief ulrich walker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roadster failed to meet smart 's expectations nevertheless , last year , when daimlerchrysler was faced with major headaches with its prestigious mercedes brand , there was much talk that smart might be sold off or shut down altogether .
in the end , the parent company gave the unit a stay of execution . but in the attempt to steer the unit back to profit , 700 jobs have been axed , most of them in the company 's headquarters near stuttgart .
and the derivative four-seater -lrb- forfour -rrb- and sports -lrb- roadster -rrb- versions have been abandoned . smart chief walker was confident that " with our fixed costs down 50 percent , we 'll be able to break even , even in the worst-case scenario . " furthermore , smart is scheduled to be launched in the united states at the start of 2008 . " it 's the right moment , with environmental issues and high oil prices increasingly in the spotlight in the us , " said daimlerchrysler chief zetsche . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese smart car copy may hit european markets soon corporate losses stemming from copyright fraud in china have been estimated in the tens of billions .

the city 's local government wants to introducing a controversial smoking ban that would include not only public buildings , but also all bars and restaurants . the city could go smoke-free as early as january 2007 .
surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray . " i think it 's a very good idea because the places are cleaner and have better air , " he said " the experiences other european countries already have seem to be positive , so why should n't germany join the club ? " germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european countries have already banned smoking " i 'm absolutely in favor of it .
i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .
" it would be better for families and it 's nicer to come home and not smell like a smoker .
we spent our holiday in ireland and they have a smoking ban and it works out there .
and it 's still a great atmosphere in the pubs in ireland . " surprisingly , public opinion is largely in favor of the ban .
according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .
dina , 23 , has been a bartender for two years but has smoked for more than three times as long .
she thinks bars without smoke will make for a very tense night out . " i do n't think a lot of it .
you know , i 'm smoking .
i like to smoke when i go out , " she said . even with broad public support , it 's unclear whether berlin will follow the united states and other european countries before them and give up " the german vice . " in the fashionable bars and restaurants of berlin , it seems that the coolness quotient is inversely proportional to the air quality .
what ’ s even more surprising is that many of these urban hipsters also stockpile all things organic and moan should they miss their daily yoga lesson . the new laws could be the herald of a whole new way of life for germans .
but do n't hold your breath . michelle hennery -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany dumps tobacco advertising to comply with eu the german parliament has voted to ban nearly all tobacco advertising to comply with european union mandates .

" people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one memorial to those who died " the lights will illuminate the spot where the wall once stood , as well as the immediate border area .
on roads that now link east-west berlin , narrow strips of light at a height of 3.6 meters and at ground level will show the route of the wall , " buecke said . interactive art with meaning dirks said the group project would not be an isolated art happening . " the idea is that it should be harnessed to the overall concept of events linked to the wall 's 20th anniversary , " dirks said . pastor manfred fischer , chairman of the city 's bernauerstrasse wall memorial site , said berlin is the right location for the " wall of light " idea .
the project is expected to cost 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.54 million -rrb- if realized and run for six weeks , starting nov .
9 , 2009 , if approved by the city government . reiner klemke , a berlin city government culture official , said it was an interesting and realistic art project , but warned that it must in no way be a " glorification of the wall . " few wall memorials exist plans relating to the wall of light project are currently being displayed at an exhibition called " city of transformation , city of ideas , " at the galerie aedes in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some segments of the wall are still standing few wall remnants remain .
one exception , along with an east berlin watchtower , stands at the old checkpoint charlie crossing point among a conglomeration of new office blocks designed by american architects .
other segments of the wall are situated near the gropiusbau museum in berlin 's mitte district .
the spectacular east side gallery stretch of wall , which was illustrated by a host of german and foreign artists in 1989-90 , runs along the water in the eastern friedrichshain district .
but this site was never part of the original barrier , serving only as a secondary barrier . tourists want to see more ever since the wall was torn down in 1989-90 , foreign tourists visiting berlin have complained that they have trouble finding any trace of the barrier , which caused so much misery for the berliners during the cold war era and led to many people being killed trying to flee to the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragments of the wall are sold as souvenirs the city 's main wall memorial site is at bernauerstrasse , a city street cut in half by the border and where , after the construction of the barrier , desperate east berliners tried jumping to the western side from houses backing on to the west . but its location is some distance from the city center , leading sometimes to it being overlooked by tourists . events marking the 17th anniversary of the wall 's 1989 demise were held in berlin thursday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

9 , 2009 . ever since berlin 's famous landmark was dismantled in 1989 , the berlin authorities have been in a quandary over the most suitable way of remembering the oppressive , grey 155-kilometer-long -lrb- around 96 miles -rrb- barrier , which not only sliced the city in half but also surrounded its western border for nearly 30 years , between 1961 and 1989 . " people would be able to pass through the wall of light without hesitation , symbolically , reliving the moment of the barrier 's demise , " explained architect dirk buecke , who said the idea would involve erecting 3.6-meter-high -lrb- 12 feet -rrb- steel elements equipped with laser projectors , every 100 meters or so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one memorial to those who died " the lights will illuminate the spot where the wall once stood , as well as the immediate border area .
on roads that now link east-west berlin , narrow strips of light at a height of 3.6 meters and at ground level will show the route of the wall , " buecke said . interactive art with meaning dirks said the group project would not be an isolated art happening . " the idea is that it should be harnessed to the overall concept of events linked to the wall 's 20th anniversary , " dirks said . pastor manfred fischer , chairman of the city 's bernauerstrasse wall memorial site , said berlin is the right location for the " wall of light " idea .
the project is expected to cost 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.54 million -rrb- if realized and run for six weeks , starting nov .
9 , 2009 , if approved by the city government . reiner klemke , a berlin city government culture official , said it was an interesting and realistic art project , but warned that it must in no way be a " glorification of the wall . " few wall memorials exist plans relating to the wall of light project are currently being displayed at an exhibition called " city of transformation , city of ideas , " at the galerie aedes in berlin .

one exception , along with an east berlin watchtower , stands at the old checkpoint charlie crossing point among a conglomeration of new office blocks designed by american architects .
other segments of the wall are situated near the gropiusbau museum in berlin 's mitte district .
the spectacular east side gallery stretch of wall , which was illustrated by a host of german and foreign artists in 1989-90 , runs along the water in the eastern friedrichshain district .
but this site was never part of the original barrier , serving only as a secondary barrier . tourists want to see more ever since the wall was torn down in 1989-90 , foreign tourists visiting berlin have complained that they have trouble finding any trace of the barrier , which caused so much misery for the berliners during the cold war era and led to many people being killed trying to flee to the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fragments of the wall are sold as souvenirs the city 's main wall memorial site is at bernauerstrasse , a city street cut in half by the border and where , after the construction of the barrier , desperate east berliners tried jumping to the western side from houses backing on to the west . but its location is some distance from the city center , leading sometimes to it being overlooked by tourists . events marking the 17th anniversary of the wall 's 1989 demise were held in berlin thursday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

the city 's local government wants to introducing a controversial smoking ban that would include not only public buildings , but also all bars and restaurants . the city could go smoke-free as early as january 2007 .
surprisingly , some berliners are already beginning to get used to the idea . hans , a 39-year-old freelance management consultant , meets friends at a local bar most evenings and looks forward to being able to end a night without smelling like an ashtray . " i think it 's a very good idea because the places are cleaner and have better air , " he said " the experiences other european countries already have seem to be positive , so why should n't germany join the club ? " germans puffs away germany finds itself one of the dwindling number of eu countries that does not have a nationwide smoking ban in public spaces but could soon be next .
germany leads western europe in tobacco consumption with about 34 percent of the public smoking regularly and nearly 140,000 germans dying every year from tobacco-related illnesses .
some 3,000 people die from second hand smoke annually , according to the german cancer research center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german restaurants lack smoke-free areas berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the left party , announced last week that they will press ahead with plans to make the german capital smoke-free out of concern over public health .
german pub and restaurant owners pledged to create non-smoking areas in their establishments .
yet only about 30 percent of germany 's 100,000 restaurants offer a non-smoking section , according to the german hotel and restaurant association . ban has public support supporters of a ban dismiss claims that bars and restaurants will lose customers .
matthias , a 31-year-old teacher from kreuzberg , believes that berliners will become accustomed to smokeless bars and points to the experience of ireland where smoking in the workplace was banned two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european countries have already banned smoking " i 'm absolutely in favor of it .
i think it 's a good idea and people just would get used to it , " matthias said .
" it would be better for families and it 's nicer to come home and not smell like a smoker .
we spent our holiday in ireland and they have a smoking ban and it works out there .
and it 's still a great atmosphere in the pubs in ireland . " surprisingly , public opinion is largely in favor of the ban .
according to a recent der spiegel survey , 44 percent of interviewees were in favor of a general smoking ban in restaurants and bars , while 66 percent supported smoking bans at workplaces . in fact , none of the smokers approached at random at the bars and restaurants around prenzlauer berg were against it .
after taking an introspective drag on her cigarette , 22-year-old janine , whose friends dubiously laughed when she admitted to smoking about ten cigarettes each day , said that she looked forward to the ban as an incentive to give up the habit . " i actually support the ban because i 'd like to quit smoking pretty soon , so i think it 's just good for health , " she said . coolness quotient bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fashionable bars are full of smoke but not everyone thinks it ’ s such a good idea .
dina , 23 , has been a bartender for two years but has smoked for more than three times as long .
she thinks bars without smoke will make for a very tense night out . " i do n't think a lot of it .
you know , i 'm smoking .
i like to smoke when i go out , " she said . even with broad public support , it 's unclear whether berlin will follow the united states and other european countries before them and give up " the german vice . " in the fashionable bars and restaurants of berlin , it seems that the coolness quotient is inversely proportional to the air quality .
what ’ s even more surprising is that many of these urban hipsters also stockpile all things organic and moan should they miss their daily yoga lesson . the new laws could be the herald of a whole new way of life for germans .

organised religion lacked compassion and turned people into " hateful lemmings " , he told the observer .
but the musician said he loved the idea of the teachings of jesus christ and the beautiful stories about it which he had learned at sunday school .
and he said there were many gays he knew who loved their religion .
' does n't work ' his comments were made in a special gay edition of the observer music monthly magazine , where he was interviewed by scissor sisters ' jake shears .
" i think religion has always tried to turn hatred towards gay people , " he said .
" religion promotes the hatred and spite against gays .
" but there are so many people i know who are gay and love their religion . "
according to the singer-songwriter , 59 , his solution would be to " ban religion completely , even though there are some wonderful things about it " .
he added : " i love the idea of the teachings of jesus christ and the beautiful stories about it , which i loved in sunday school and i collected all the little stickers and put them in my book .
" but the reality is that organised religion does n't seem to work .
it turns people into hateful lemmings and it 's not really compassionate . "
he also said that the problems experienced by many gays in former nations of the soviet bloc , such as poland , latvia and russia were caused by the church supporting anti-gay movements .
' god 's people ' and he called on the leaders of major religions to hold a " conclave " to discuss the fate of the world - which he said was " near escalating to world war three " .
" i said this after 9/11 and people thought i was nuts , " he said .
" it 's all got to be dialogue - that 's the only way .
get everybody from each religion together and say ' listen , this ca n't go on .
why do we have all this hatred ? '
" we are all god 's people ; we have to get along and the -lsb- religious leaders -rsb- have to lead the way .
if they do n't do it , who else is going to do it ?
they 're not going to do it and it 's left to musicians or to someone else to deal with it . "

and he said there were many gays he knew who loved their religion .
' does n't work ' his comments were made in a special gay edition of the observer music monthly magazine , where he was interviewed by scissor sisters ' jake shears .

backbench mp jon cruddas said the acquittal of the bnp leader , nick griffin , on a charge of inciting racial hatred was a wake-up call .
mr cruddas added that the bnp was thriving in poor communities amid an atmosphere of fear and tension .
the mp backs more local campaigning by the labour party .
mr cruddas has experience with the issue - as some of his constituents in east london voted for the bnp councillors .
he warned that where society was fragmenting , the bnp was becoming a rival to labour .
fear mr cruddas said the bnp thrived in poor communities and claimed mainstream parties had created " fear , tension and suspicion " during the muslim veil debate .
in a speech to the searchlight conference for labour and union activists , he said : " some communities have been badly affected by a decline in traditional industries , a shortage of affordable housing and changing migration patterns . "
he added : " we have to be honest in saying the debate over the veil , talking tough on immigration and race or the language used in the ' war on terror ' does not reassure people but actually makes the situation worse .
" it creates fear , tension and suspicion .
it divides communities and plays into the hands of extremism . "

currently , performers in the uk can receive payments for 50 years , at which point their work goes out of copyright .
but 62 % of people polled by yougov for the british phonographic industry -lrb- bpi -rrb- think uk artists should be protected for 95 years , as they are in the us .
a uk government review on copyright will be published later this month .
the bpi has led the campaign to extend the number of years artists can receive royalties .
pensions threat they have found a vocal spokesperson in sir cliff richard , whose debut hit , move it , would go out of copyright in 2008 under current law .
earlier this year , he told the bbc that singers wanted the same rights as songwriters , who get royalties for life plus 70 years .
" it seems to me we should ask for parity , " he said .
" it does n't seem just . "
according to the singer , many musicians recording in the 1950s rely on their copyright payments as a pension .
" it seems terribly wrong that 50 years on they lose everything from it . " said sir cliff .
but the british library has opposed extending copyright , saying it would endanger the uk 's national music archive .
the library 's sound archive can not copy audio from fragile or obsolete formats for posterity until copyright runs out .
if copyright is extended beyond 50 years , it argues , a " significant " part of the collection could " decay and be unavailable for future generations " .

the government had planned to sell an 8bn australian dollars -lrb- $ 6.1bn ; £ 3.2bn -rrb- chunk of its 51.8 % holding in the firm .
but after a late surge in demand from retail investors , total demand for shares was now worth a $ 9.2bn , it said .
the sale - dubbed t3 - will be the biggest public share offering in australia since 1999 .
the government raised a $ 16bn in that year from a previous telstra sale .
the float is known as t3 because it is the third tranche of telstra shares offered by the government , after t1 in 1997 , and t2 in 1999 .
strong demand on sunday , the government announced it would be expanding the sale as demand had been well above the planned 2.15 billion share offer .
finance minister nick minchin added that interest in t3 from individual applications , brokers , and a japanese retail offer , meant retail demand was now around 2.5 billion shares .
the retail sale closed on friday .
a further institutional offer opens on 15 november .
mr minchin said the prospectus for the share sale did allow the government to expand the number of shares on offer under a 15 % over-allocation option .
" while we will not know the take-up by institutional shareholders until the close of the offer at the end of this week , the results of the retail offer to date means an increase will occur , " he said in a statement .
controversial plan following the sell-off the government plans to put the remainder of its telstra shares in an investment fund which has been set up to cover public service pension payments .
plans to privatise the telecom firm have been dogged by controversy .
opponents say it could result in reduced rural services .
supporters of privatisation think it will make the company more competitive .
the t3 shares will begin trading on the australian stock market on 20 november .

analysts expect iberdrola to table a £ 12bn -lrb- $ 23bn -rrb- cash and share bid , with the offer likely to value scottish power shares at more than 800p .
on friday , iberdrola confirmed it was in negotiations with scottish power , but it is believed that the two have been in talks for two months .
but market watchers believe rival firms could still break up the talks .
french utility edf and german rival rwe are believed to be keeping an eye on developments .
last year , scottish power rejected a bid approach of 570 pence a share from german utility e.on. split ?
however , the observer report also suggested that iberdrola was examining the possibility of breaking up the uk group .
under such a plan the spanish firm would hold onto scottish power 's renewable energy assets , while an infrastructure fund would take on its transmission and distribution networks .
scottish power supplies energy to 5.2 million uk customers .
it also has electricity generation and gas storage facilities in the uk , us and western canada , and is britain 's biggest generator and developer of wind energy .
on tuesday , the group - the uk 's fifth largest energy supplier - is expected to reveal pre-tax profits for the six months to 30 september rose 50 % to £ 417m .

analysts expect iberdrola to table a £ 12bn -lrb- $ 23bn -rrb- cash and share bid , with the offer likely to value scottish power shares at more than 800p .
on friday , iberdrola confirmed it was in negotiations with scottish power , but it is believed that the two have been in talks for two months .
but market watchers believe rival firms could still break up the talks .
french utility edf and german rival rwe are believed to be keeping an eye on developments .
last year , scottish power rejected a bid approach of 570 pence a share from german utility e.on. split ?
however , the observer report also suggested that iberdrola was examining the possibility of breaking up the uk group .
under such a plan the spanish firm would hold onto scottish power 's renewable energy assets , while an infrastructure fund would take on its transmission and distribution networks .
scottish power supplies energy to 5.2 million uk customers .

pop star kylie minogue has taken to the stage in sydney wearing a pink feather head-dress for her first concert since being treated for breast cancer .
" good evening sydney ! " the singer shouted as she emerged from a rising platform in the centre of the stage .
minogue , 38 , was re-opening her showgirl world tour which was postponed after her diagnosis in may 2005 .
she will play 20 concerts in her native australia before the tour reaches the uk in january next year .
the set has changed significantly from last year 's showgirl concerts because minogue is not yet fully fit .
' hopeful ' the comeback felt like a carnival , full of sequins , shocking pink feather boas , and pink cowboy hats first night review " i 'm as prepared as i can be but i 'm not sure that i 'll be able to do everything that i did before , " she told the press before the concert .
" not that i do an enormous amount of jumping all over the stage , but quick changes are really stressful . "
despite her worries , the star put on an energetic performance , and managed to squeeze into a variety of costumes designed by fashion icons such as dolce e gabbana , karl lagerfeld , emilio pucci and john galliano .
she performed hits from her 20-year-long pop career , including in your eyes , shocked , and better the devil you know - which opened the show .
the concert also featured a new song , white diamond , co-written with the us dance act , scissor sisters .
surgery minogue revealed that she had cancer in may 2005 and underwent surgery in australia two days later .
the singer finished her chemotherapy in december 2005 , but still receives treatment to prevent a return of the cancer .
she performed uk and european dates of her greatest hits tour between march and may last year .
but the pop star was forced to abandon her showgirl world tour and an appearance at the glastonbury festival after her diagnosis .
festival organiser michael eavis has said he remains " hopeful " that the star will play next year 's event .
