the argentines will meet mexico in leipzig in the second round on saturday . argentina had a raft of chances throughout the match , and dutch coach marco van basten had two fine first-half clearances by defender khalid boulahrouz and one outstanding save late in the game by edwin van der sar to thank for a clean sheet . messi , tevez create havoc argentine strikers lionel messi and carlos tevez , along with midfield duo maxi rodriguez and juan riquelme , caused havoc in the dutch defense early on with their tight combinations of fast , accurate passing and blistering counter-attacking speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' khalid boulahrouz , left , and argentina 's lionel messi challenge for the ball teenage sensation messi made his mark in the eighth minute , playing a dangerous through ball into the area , which boulahrouz just managed to get his foot to ahead of the onrushing esteban cambiasso and nicolas burdisso . man-of-the-match tevez had a chance just after the quarter-hour , turning inside phillip cocu and unleashing a powerful left-footed shot just past the outside post of captain van der sar , who was winning his 112th cap to draw level on all-time appearances for the oranje with frank de boer . the netherlands ' best chance came a minute later , but dirk kuyt drilled a shot just wide . van der sar was then called into action in the 27th minute to punch away a swerving riquelme corner . from the ensuing corner kuyt brought down tevez on the edge of the box and the dutch fans had the imposing 1.91m frame of boulahrouz to thank again as he lunged to fend off the free-kick from tevez 's feet onto the post and away .
rodriguez then watched in agony as his blistering half-volley beat van der sar but drifted late and shaved off the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying van der sar saved the day for the dutch on the stroke of half-time , van der sar saved a messi shot after the barcelona striker was allowed far too much time in front of goal . the second-half started with riquleme taking advantage of the dutch defense standing off to fire a shot that narrowly missed goal , and rodriguez following up shortly after with a shot that flew high . van der sar saves the day but the dutch did manage to clamp down on the argentineans , wesley sneijder and cocu - winning his 100th cap - dropping into deeper positions to nullify the threat of the free-running tevez . but the netherlands were obviously lacking the creative spark provided by the rested arjen robben , giovanni van bronkhorst and mark van bommel . that said , the dutch pressure almost paid off in the 67th minute , cocu going close after good work by rafael van der vart .
with messi and riquelme both replaced by coach jose pekerman , the game fizzled out somewhat and swung towards the dutch . but it was fittingly left to the record-equaling van der sar to save the day for the dutch , defying his 35 years to superbly palm away a great strike by tevez in the 73rd minute . the oranje army again invaded frankfurt for the match with airlines in the netherlands laying on 32 flights to the german city on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oranje fans were out in full force officially only 6,200 fans came with a ticket but it was estimated that 25,000 fans would be in the 48,000-seater stadium and up to 40,000 more in the city . there was also a sizeable number of argentine supporters , many sporting the no. 10 shirt favored by diego maradona , with flags and scarves tied to their wrists .
maradona himself was seen in the stands along with his daughter , passionately cheering on the argentine side . the elephants claw back the other " group of death " game saw a spirited ivory coast coming from behind to beat serbia & montenegro 3-2 .
the elephants fought back from two goals down to clinch their first world cup win in an entertaining and fiercely-fought battle on wednesday in munich , played in pouring rain , to avoid ending bottom of group c. despite being eliminated from the world cup , both heavily-changed teams went at it hammer and tongs from the start before a capacity 66,000 crowd in a bid to restore their pride .
although ivory coast had the best of the play in the first ten minutes , their trio of newcomers at the back were caught out by long high balls from serbia and montenegro 's . serbia , seeking self-respect after a 6-0 drubbing by argentina , took the lead in the 10th minute with striker nikola zigic slotting in the ball after a long pass by dejan stankovic .
they built up on the result in the 19th minute after a botched clearance by ivory coast stand-in captain cyrille domoraud was seized by sasa ilic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivory coast players celebrate after their third goal the ivorians however made up in the 36th minute with arune dindane neatly netting a twice-taken penalty .
the strengthened ivorians dominated in the second half and dindane once again showed his class by heading in a kader keita cross in the 67th minute . the ivorians were n't finished as yet when kalou stepped up to score and seal a historic victory for ivory coast . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina beat up serbia and montenegro argentina proved why some consider them a world cup title contender , displaying their speed and precision passing in a 6-0 rout of their group c opponents .

the argentines will meet mexico in leipzig in the second round on saturday . argentina had a raft of chances throughout the match , and dutch coach marco van basten had two fine first-half clearances by defender khalid boulahrouz and one outstanding save late in the game by edwin van der sar to thank for a clean sheet . messi , tevez create havoc argentine strikers lionel messi and carlos tevez , along with midfield duo maxi rodriguez and juan riquelme , caused havoc in the dutch defense early on with their tight combinations of fast , accurate passing and blistering counter-attacking speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' khalid boulahrouz , left , and argentina 's lionel messi challenge for the ball teenage sensation messi made his mark in the eighth minute , playing a dangerous through ball into the area , which boulahrouz just managed to get his foot to ahead of the onrushing esteban cambiasso and nicolas burdisso . man-of-the-match tevez had a chance just after the quarter-hour , turning inside phillip cocu and unleashing a powerful left-footed shot just past the outside post of captain van der sar , who was winning his 112th cap to draw level on all-time appearances for the oranje with frank de boer . the netherlands ' best chance came a minute later , but dirk kuyt drilled a shot just wide . van der sar was then called into action in the 27th minute to punch away a swerving riquelme corner . from the ensuing corner kuyt brought down tevez on the edge of the box and the dutch fans had the imposing 1.91m frame of boulahrouz to thank again as he lunged to fend off the free-kick from tevez 's feet onto the post and away .
rodriguez then watched in agony as his blistering half-volley beat van der sar but drifted late and shaved off the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying van der sar saved the day for the dutch on the stroke of half-time , van der sar saved a messi shot after the barcelona striker was allowed far too much time in front of goal . the second-half started with riquleme taking advantage of the dutch defense standing off to fire a shot that narrowly missed goal , and rodriguez following up shortly after with a shot that flew high . van der sar saves the day but the dutch did manage to clamp down on the argentineans , wesley sneijder and cocu - winning his 100th cap - dropping into deeper positions to nullify the threat of the free-running tevez . but the netherlands were obviously lacking the creative spark provided by the rested arjen robben , giovanni van bronkhorst and mark van bommel . that said , the dutch pressure almost paid off in the 67th minute , cocu going close after good work by rafael van der vart .
with messi and riquelme both replaced by coach jose pekerman , the game fizzled out somewhat and swung towards the dutch . but it was fittingly left to the record-equaling van der sar to save the day for the dutch , defying his 35 years to superbly palm away a great strike by tevez in the 73rd minute . the oranje army again invaded frankfurt for the match with airlines in the netherlands laying on 32 flights to the german city on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oranje fans were out in full force officially only 6,200 fans came with a ticket but it was estimated that 25,000 fans would be in the 48,000-seater stadium and up to 40,000 more in the city . there was also a sizeable number of argentine supporters , many sporting the no. 10 shirt favored by diego maradona , with flags and scarves tied to their wrists .
maradona himself was seen in the stands along with his daughter , passionately cheering on the argentine side . the elephants claw back the other " group of death " game saw a spirited ivory coast coming from behind to beat serbia & montenegro 3-2 .
the elephants fought back from two goals down to clinch their first world cup win in an entertaining and fiercely-fought battle on wednesday in munich , played in pouring rain , to avoid ending bottom of group c. despite being eliminated from the world cup , both heavily-changed teams went at it hammer and tongs from the start before a capacity 66,000 crowd in a bid to restore their pride .
although ivory coast had the best of the play in the first ten minutes , their trio of newcomers at the back were caught out by long high balls from serbia and montenegro 's . serbia , seeking self-respect after a 6-0 drubbing by argentina , took the lead in the 10th minute with striker nikola zigic slotting in the ball after a long pass by dejan stankovic .
they built up on the result in the 19th minute after a botched clearance by ivory coast stand-in captain cyrille domoraud was seized by sasa ilic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivory coast players celebrate after their third goal the ivorians however made up in the 36th minute with arune dindane neatly netting a twice-taken penalty .
the strengthened ivorians dominated in the second half and dindane once again showed his class by heading in a kader keita cross in the 67th minute . the ivorians were n't finished as yet when kalou stepped up to score and seal a historic victory for ivory coast . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina beat up serbia and montenegro argentina proved why some consider them a world cup title contender , displaying their speed and precision passing in a 6-0 rout of their group c opponents .

what are the implications of new technologies on the european cultural scene ?
a conference in salzburg , austria is looking for answers . " an expedition to european digital cultural heritage " - a two-day international conference on digitalizing europe 's cultural legacy - opened on tuesday in the austrian city of salzburg . the conference , organized under the patronage of the austrian presidency over the european union , focuses on the strategies of long-term preservation of european cultural and scientific resources and the ways in which technology as well as policy can help in the process of collecting , connecting and communicating our cultural memory . the conference is meant to contribute to the open debate between research communities and heritage institutions such as libraries and museums , on the one hand , and multimedia entrepreneurs , technology providers and policy makers , on the other . making the past available in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european archives contain a wealth of important , but largely inaccessible documents recognizing the importance of new technologies , the eu commission has designed a strategy called i2010 to promote the development of information society in europe across national and linguistic borders . the goal of the agenda i2010 is the creation of the so-called common european information space , in which european citizens will be able to access and share on the internet a wealth of written and audio-visual materials and services , regardless of which country they come from . participants in the salzburg conference will be paying particular attention to the essential part of the common european information space - the european digital library .
two million books , films , photographs , manuscripts and other works should be online through the library by 2008 , and the figure is expected to rise to six million by 2010 as more and more libraries , archives and museums plug in . a cultural utopia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " an expedition to european digital cultural heritage " is taking place in salzburg , austria this titanic project is an attempt to address the cultural paradox of the internet age : the more data is available , the more difficult it becomes to access it .
estimates show than the amount of new information produced in the year 2002 alone - 5 billion gigabytes - is 37,000 times larger than the holdings of the us library of congress , the world 's largest library . us internet search giant google triggered an international race to build an online library when it announced plans in december 2004 to digitize books and documents from a handful of big libraries . us internet and software giants yahoo , microsoft and amazon have since announced separate plans while france , angry that private companies took the lead and concerned about the us-american domination in the field , has pushed for the creation of a public digital library . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to allow opening of huge holocaust archive germany agreed tuesday to support opening a massive trove of world war ii records on 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime , after six decades of highly restricted access .

is german soccer legend franz beckenbauer really a human being ?

he does seem capable of beaming himself to different galaxies at the speed of light . sweating at home in front of the tv set watching a world cup game has at least one advantage over sweating collectively at the stadium : you actually get to see more .
after trying to lip-read the obscenities a player is throwing at the referee , you can compare your own beer belly with a horde of face-painted , shirtless soccer freaks .
and still , only a few seconds later , you can hang out with the spanish royal couple or the otherwise sleepy german chancellor trying to get in touch with her inner beast . as you move from game to game and from city to city , you also get to admire one world cup attendee , for whom defying the laws of physics is turning into a favorite pastime .
franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and president of the soccer championship organizing committee , is the only world cup celebrity that seems capable of being at different places at the same time .
you can see him in almost every city , at almost every game .

one of his most prolific campaigns has been for a german cell phone provider known for expensive-looking and alluring celebrity ads .
german couch potatoes who have a profound relationship with their remote controls have discovered that there are days on which they can start watching a beckenbauer commercial on one channel , switch to the middle of it on a different channel , and still make it to grand finale on a third . along with veronica ferres - a blond german actress with the spanish sounding name - and anna netrebko - a russian opera diva with the body of a greek goddess - germans have seen beckenbauer do all sorts of things in those commercials : getting bottles out of his wine cellar for a plaster fest with his raucous soccer buddies ; yakking away on his cell phone ; hanging out at the north pole ; mugging the unsuspecting father christmas and even flying in a chopper over soccer-mad germany . helicopters are , it seems , his thing . an imperial catfight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soprano anna netrebko is beckenbauer 's comrade-in-advertising but this is where things get a little complicated with the chopper-flying tsar .

is german soccer legend franz beckenbauer really a human being ?
or is he merely a science fiction invention ?
he does seem capable of beaming himself to different galaxies at the speed of light . sweating at home in front of the tv set watching a world cup game has at least one advantage over sweating collectively at the stadium : you actually get to see more .
after trying to lip-read the obscenities a player is throwing at the referee , you can compare your own beer belly with a horde of face-painted , shirtless soccer freaks .
and still , only a few seconds later , you can hang out with the spanish royal couple or the otherwise sleepy german chancellor trying to get in touch with her inner beast . as you move from game to game and from city to city , you also get to admire one world cup attendee , for whom defying the laws of physics is turning into a favorite pastime .
franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and president of the soccer championship organizing committee , is the only world cup celebrity that seems capable of being at different places at the same time .
you can see him in almost every city , at almost every game .
the man is a genius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer 's bavarian star trek friends so how does he do it ?
is he in possession of an intergalactic star trek beamer ?
did he hire an army of look-alikes ?
or does he have an exclusive deal with overbearing magician david copperfield ? apparently , not .
in-between games , beckenbauer - whose popular teutonic nickname is " kaiser " -lrb- emperor -rrb- - gets to do what most soccer fans would be too drunk to even contemplate at the end of a match .
he hops on augusta 109 , his regally named helicopter , and flies off to wherever his cosmopolitan heart may take him .
hasta la vista , gelsenkirchen !

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad . " we have to make sure we gain competitive advantage when it comes to corporate taxes , " böttcher said .
" twenty-five percent should be the orientation mark .
if we leave that until the end of the decade , it will be too late . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system .

but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad .

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad . " we have to make sure we gain competitive advantage when it comes to corporate taxes , " böttcher said .
" twenty-five percent should be the orientation mark .
if we leave that until the end of the decade , it will be too late .

dw-world.de talked to both germany 's guests from the land of the rising sun and their hosts . a stroll through the streets of bonn will reveal that many japanese visitors have traveled half way around the world to support their national soccer stars as they face the world 's very best this month in the world cup .
they have chosen to stay in the former german capital for part or all of the month of june because the japanese team also has set up its headquarters here . while all of germany was busy preparing for scores of international guests , bonn focused especially on preparation for the japanese guests to come . g-jamps the team 's official media and fan headquarters - dubbed g-jamps -lrb- germany japan national team media partners supporters -rrb- - is not located in a hotel , stadium or office building , but in a museum . " we chose -lrb- the rheinisches landesmuseum -rrb- as our media and fan center because many of the guests from japan who are coming to bonn during the world cup also want to take a bit of culture back with them , " said masato watanabe , a representative of the japanese football association . g-jamps serves as a central meeting point not only for japanese visitors and journalists but also for anybody interested in the japanese team .
but soccer is just the beginning .
courses , performances and presentations are being offered throughout the world cup in cooperation with the german-japanese society - everything from flower arranging and kimonos to martial arts , go -lrb- a japanese board game -rrb- and origami is on the program . the museum 's restaurant features both japanese and local cuisine and , in the spirit of intercultural understanding , sushi is only on offer when the german team plays . sausage a n d beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans were waiting with pens and hopeful smiles when the team left their hotel to go to practice a japanese beer-maker is an official sponsor of the country 's team and its presence ca n't be overlooked at g-jamps .
but visitors from japan are eager to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know elements of german culture while they are in the country .
it is not surprising that beer and sausage are among the musts . " most of the japanese guests speak good english and those who do n't bring pictures with them of german dishes they would like to try , " said paul hofmann , a server at haus daufenbach .
through connections with the united nations , located in bonn , the combined restaurant and hotel also has numerous guests from other un nations , including yemen , ecuador , and ethiopia . michael thomas from zum gequetschen -lrb- which could be roughly translated as " at the squeezed " -rrb- , a popular restaurant in the city center featuring traditional german cuisine , said that around 50 percent of international guests this month are from japan . " the japanese customers drink less and meals are more communal , " he said .
" they 'll order one dish and four plates and share it . " home comfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sushi and sausage are availabe here at the blue samurai 's media and fan headquarters but heavy german dishes on a daily basis get to be too much after a while .
according to a server at a bonn sushi bar , some of the japanese visitors also search out more familiar tastes in between the sauerkraut and bratwurst . " the japanese noodle house around the corner has many japanese guests , " she said .
" they prefer warm dishes and sushi is more of a snack .
they come here first to eat sushi and then they go over to the noodle house for miso soup , tempura and other warm things . " big stadium or big scree n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising sun is visible all day long in bonn to welcome the team and their fans well nourished , rested and ready to go , blue samurai fans have several options when it comes to watching their team in action .

but visitors from japan are eager to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know elements of german culture while they are in the country .
it is not surprising that beer and sausage are among the musts . " most of the japanese guests speak good english and those who do n't bring pictures with them of german dishes they would like to try , " said paul hofmann , a server at haus daufenbach .
through connections with the united nations , located in bonn , the combined restaurant and hotel also has numerous guests from other un nations , including yemen , ecuador , and ethiopia . michael thomas from zum gequetschen -lrb- which could be roughly translated as " at the squeezed " -rrb- , a popular restaurant in the city center featuring traditional german cuisine , said that around 50 percent of international guests this month are from japan . " the japanese customers drink less and meals are more communal , " he said .
" they 'll order one dish and four plates and share it . " home comfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sushi and sausage are availabe here at the blue samurai 's media and fan headquarters but heavy german dishes on a daily basis get to be too much after a while .
according to a server at a bonn sushi bar , some of the japanese visitors also search out more familiar tastes in between the sauerkraut and bratwurst . " the japanese noodle house around the corner has many japanese guests , " she said .
" they prefer warm dishes and sushi is more of a snack .
they come here first to eat sushi and then they go over to the noodle house for miso soup , tempura and other warm things . " big stadium or big scree n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising sun is visible all day long in bonn to welcome the team and their fans well nourished , rested and ready to go , blue samurai fans have several options when it comes to watching their team in action .
the best bet is to visit the stadium in bonn , where the team trains .
times are made public and entry is free - quite a deal , considering the hundreds of euros people pay to see the same team in a live game .
the only disadvantage , of course , is the absence of an opponent . those who want to see the games but do n't have tickets can still enjoy the stadium atmosphere by going to the big screen set up on one of bonn 's two large , open market squares .
there the cheapest seat goes for 11 euros -lrb- 13.50 dollars -rrb- , which makes the slightly smaller screen at the pub around the corner look a bit more appealing . megunu and musaku , two soccer fans from japan , were on their way to view the blue samurai during a training session at bonn 's stadium .
they had met as tourists in barcelona and decided to continue on together to germany for the world cup .
when asked about the blue samurai 's performance , musaku did n't beat around the bush . " the players are very good , but the coach is bad , " he said . o n e poi n t for japa n japan 's national coach , zico , is a soccer legend from brazil . " in my opinion it 's better to face brazil in this round rather than later in the k.o. round , " zico was quoted as saying in die zeit .
" better now and then again the finals .
whoever wants to achieve something at the world cup has to be prepared for everything . " after losing to australia last week 3-1 and tying with croatia 0-0 on sunday , the blue samurai will come up against zico 's native brazil on thursday , june 22 at 7 p.m.

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research .

the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad .

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad . " we have to make sure we gain competitive advantage when it comes to corporate taxes , " böttcher said .

dw-world.de talked to both germany 's guests from the land of the rising sun and their hosts . a stroll through the streets of bonn will reveal that many japanese visitors have traveled half way around the world to support their national soccer stars as they face the world 's very best this month in the world cup .
they have chosen to stay in the former german capital for part or all of the month of june because the japanese team also has set up its headquarters here . while all of germany was busy preparing for scores of international guests , bonn focused especially on preparation for the japanese guests to come . g-jamps the team 's official media and fan headquarters - dubbed g-jamps -lrb- germany japan national team media partners supporters -rrb- - is not located in a hotel , stadium or office building , but in a museum . " we chose -lrb- the rheinisches landesmuseum -rrb- as our media and fan center because many of the guests from japan who are coming to bonn during the world cup also want to take a bit of culture back with them , " said masato watanabe , a representative of the japanese football association . g-jamps serves as a central meeting point not only for japanese visitors and journalists but also for anybody interested in the japanese team .
but soccer is just the beginning .
courses , performances and presentations are being offered throughout the world cup in cooperation with the german-japanese society - everything from flower arranging and kimonos to martial arts , go -lrb- a japanese board game -rrb- and origami is on the program . the museum 's restaurant features both japanese and local cuisine and , in the spirit of intercultural understanding , sushi is only on offer when the german team plays . sausage a n d beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans were waiting with pens and hopeful smiles when the team left their hotel to go to practice a japanese beer-maker is an official sponsor of the country 's team and its presence ca n't be overlooked at g-jamps .
but visitors from japan are eager to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know elements of german culture while they are in the country .
it is not surprising that beer and sausage are among the musts . " most of the japanese guests speak good english and those who do n't bring pictures with them of german dishes they would like to try , " said paul hofmann , a server at haus daufenbach .
through connections with the united nations , located in bonn , the combined restaurant and hotel also has numerous guests from other un nations , including yemen , ecuador , and ethiopia . michael thomas from zum gequetschen -lrb- which could be roughly translated as " at the squeezed " -rrb- , a popular restaurant in the city center featuring traditional german cuisine , said that around 50 percent of international guests this month are from japan . " the japanese customers drink less and meals are more communal , " he said .
" they 'll order one dish and four plates and share it . " home comfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sushi and sausage are availabe here at the blue samurai 's media and fan headquarters but heavy german dishes on a daily basis get to be too much after a while .
according to a server at a bonn sushi bar , some of the japanese visitors also search out more familiar tastes in between the sauerkraut and bratwurst . " the japanese noodle house around the corner has many japanese guests , " she said .
" they prefer warm dishes and sushi is more of a snack .
they come here first to eat sushi and then they go over to the noodle house for miso soup , tempura and other warm things . " big stadium or big scree n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising sun is visible all day long in bonn to welcome the team and their fans well nourished , rested and ready to go , blue samurai fans have several options when it comes to watching their team in action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.06.2006 german industry irked by slow pace of reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms in germany are moving at a turtle 's pace , experts complain while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .
they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.06.2006 german industry irked by slow pace of reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms in germany are moving at a turtle 's pace , experts complain while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .
they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad . " we have to make sure we gain competitive advantage when it comes to corporate taxes , " böttcher said .
" twenty-five percent should be the orientation mark .
if we leave that until the end of the decade , it will be too late . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

" we attach great importance to our ongoing in-depth dialogue and our common fight against terrorism and our respected domestic and international legal obligations , " according to extracts of the text read to afp . papering over differences the text does not specifically mention guantanamo , which the united states insists is needed in the war against terror . but it appears to show that the eu and the united states will be seeking in vienna to paper over their differences , in a movement of reconciliation that has continued since the two sides bickered deeply over the us invasion of iraq in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and the eu hope to paper over differences at the summit the united states has refused to join in the kyoto protocol to limit greenhouse gases but the draft text , which is still being worked on one diplomat cautioned , says : " we will work more closely to address the serious and long term challenge of climate change , biodiversity loss , and air pollution and will act with resolve and urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 21.06.2006 no goals , but plenty of action in argentine-dutch clash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan riquelme , right , and kew jaliens go for the ball two-time world cup winners argentina reached a goalless draw with the netherlands to finish top of group c in a tight , furiously-paced game in frankfurt on wednesday . the dutch team , who like the argentines posted two victories over group rivals serbia and montenegro and ivory coast , finished in second place on goal difference and will play group d winners portugal in nuremberg on sunday .
the argentines will meet mexico in leipzig in the second round on saturday . argentina had a raft of chances throughout the match , and dutch coach marco van basten had two fine first-half clearances by defender khalid boulahrouz and one outstanding save late in the game by edwin van der sar to thank for a clean sheet . messi , tevez create havoc argentine strikers lionel messi and carlos tevez , along with midfield duo maxi rodriguez and juan riquelme , caused havoc in the dutch defense early on with their tight combinations of fast , accurate passing and blistering counter-attacking speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' khalid boulahrouz , left , and argentina 's lionel messi challenge for the ball teenage sensation messi made his mark in the eighth minute , playing a dangerous through ball into the area , which boulahrouz just managed to get his foot to ahead of the onrushing esteban cambiasso and nicolas burdisso . man-of-the-match tevez had a chance just after the quarter-hour , turning inside phillip cocu and unleashing a powerful left-footed shot just past the outside post of captain van der sar , who was winning his 112th cap to draw level on all-time appearances for the oranje with frank de boer . the netherlands ' best chance came a minute later , but dirk kuyt drilled a shot just wide . van der sar was then called into action in the 27th minute to punch away a swerving riquelme corner . from the ensuing corner kuyt brought down tevez on the edge of the box and the dutch fans had the imposing 1.91m frame of boulahrouz to thank again as he lunged to fend off the free-kick from tevez 's feet onto the post and away .
rodriguez then watched in agony as his blistering half-volley beat van der sar but drifted late and shaved off the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying van der sar saved the day for the dutch on the stroke of half-time , van der sar saved a messi shot after the barcelona striker was allowed far too much time in front of goal . the second-half started with riquleme taking advantage of the dutch defense standing off to fire a shot that narrowly missed goal , and rodriguez following up shortly after with a shot that flew high . van der sar saves the day but the dutch did manage to clamp down on the argentineans , wesley sneijder and cocu - winning his 100th cap - dropping into deeper positions to nullify the threat of the free-running tevez . but the netherlands were obviously lacking the creative spark provided by the rested arjen robben , giovanni van bronkhorst and mark van bommel . that said , the dutch pressure almost paid off in the 67th minute , cocu going close after good work by rafael van der vart .

the argentines will meet mexico in leipzig in the second round on saturday . argentina had a raft of chances throughout the match , and dutch coach marco van basten had two fine first-half clearances by defender khalid boulahrouz and one outstanding save late in the game by edwin van der sar to thank for a clean sheet . messi , tevez create havoc argentine strikers lionel messi and carlos tevez , along with midfield duo maxi rodriguez and juan riquelme , caused havoc in the dutch defense early on with their tight combinations of fast , accurate passing and blistering counter-attacking speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netherlands ' khalid boulahrouz , left , and argentina 's lionel messi challenge for the ball teenage sensation messi made his mark in the eighth minute , playing a dangerous through ball into the area , which boulahrouz just managed to get his foot to ahead of the onrushing esteban cambiasso and nicolas burdisso . man-of-the-match tevez had a chance just after the quarter-hour , turning inside phillip cocu and unleashing a powerful left-footed shot just past the outside post of captain van der sar , who was winning his 112th cap to draw level on all-time appearances for the oranje with frank de boer . the netherlands ' best chance came a minute later , but dirk kuyt drilled a shot just wide . van der sar was then called into action in the 27th minute to punch away a swerving riquelme corner . from the ensuing corner kuyt brought down tevez on the edge of the box and the dutch fans had the imposing 1.91m frame of boulahrouz to thank again as he lunged to fend off the free-kick from tevez 's feet onto the post and away .
rodriguez then watched in agony as his blistering half-volley beat van der sar but drifted late and shaved off the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying van der sar saved the day for the dutch on the stroke of half-time , van der sar saved a messi shot after the barcelona striker was allowed far too much time in front of goal . the second-half started with riquleme taking advantage of the dutch defense standing off to fire a shot that narrowly missed goal , and rodriguez following up shortly after with a shot that flew high . van der sar saves the day but the dutch did manage to clamp down on the argentineans , wesley sneijder and cocu - winning his 100th cap - dropping into deeper positions to nullify the threat of the free-running tevez . but the netherlands were obviously lacking the creative spark provided by the rested arjen robben , giovanni van bronkhorst and mark van bommel . that said , the dutch pressure almost paid off in the 67th minute , cocu going close after good work by rafael van der vart .
with messi and riquelme both replaced by coach jose pekerman , the game fizzled out somewhat and swung towards the dutch . but it was fittingly left to the record-equaling van der sar to save the day for the dutch , defying his 35 years to superbly palm away a great strike by tevez in the 73rd minute . the oranje army again invaded frankfurt for the match with airlines in the netherlands laying on 32 flights to the german city on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oranje fans were out in full force officially only 6,200 fans came with a ticket but it was estimated that 25,000 fans would be in the 48,000-seater stadium and up to 40,000 more in the city . there was also a sizeable number of argentine supporters , many sporting the no. 10 shirt favored by diego maradona , with flags and scarves tied to their wrists .

" ten wins in the world cup is the kind of thing that would mark anybody 's life , especially mine , " the brazilian said . iran hold angola to draw to end world cup dreams in the group 's other game , iran dominated the first half against angola who needed a win and help from portugal to have any chance of progressing to the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola 's akwa in a duel for the ball with iran 's sohrab bakhtiarizadeh angola took the lead in the 60th minute through flavio and with portugal ahead against mexico only goal difference separated them from a place in the round of the last sixteen . but iranian defender sohrab bakhtiarizadeh headed firmly home in the 75th minute to seal the draw and end angola 's hopes . dw staff -lrb- jm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deco and ronaldo break iran 's resolve as portugal win 2-0 portugal qualified for the world cup knock-out stages for the first time in 40 years on saturday with a 2-0 win over iran .

austria is current president of the 25-nation eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel " when we work together we can accomplish big things ... the world needs us to work together , " bush told reporters at a joint news conference with schüssel .
bush said he fully understood differences with the eu over iraq . " what is past is past , " he added .
us still worki n g o n solutio n for priso n ers seeking to defuse rising eu anger at the guantanamo bay detention centers following the recent suicide of three detainees , the us president said he shared european concerns but had no immediate solution to the problem .
" i would like it to be over with , " he said .
" we will send people back to their home countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some detainees , such as britain 's " tipton three " , have been sent home already an estimated 400 detainees are left in guantanamo - mainly from saudi arabia , afghanistan and yemen - and 200 have been sent back , he said , adding that some of those in guantanamo needed to be tried because they were " cold blooded murderers " who will " murder someone if out on the street . " bush added that he was waiting " for the us supreme court to determine " how they would be tried . complyi n g with huma n rights a joint eu-us statement meanwhile did not include a specific reference to eu calls for the closure of guantanamo bay but the us vowed to ensure that measures taken to combat terrorism complied fully with human rights law .
bildunterschrift : complying with human rights law ?
guantanamo prison camp " consistent with our common values we will ensure that measures taken to combat terrorism comply fully with our international obligations , including human rights law , refugee law and international humanitarian law , " the statement stressed .

they have chosen to stay in the former german capital for part or all of the month of june because the japanese team also has set up its headquarters here . while all of germany was busy preparing for scores of international guests , bonn focused especially on preparation for the japanese guests to come . g-jamps the team 's official media and fan headquarters - dubbed g-jamps -lrb- germany japan national team media partners supporters -rrb- - is not located in a hotel , stadium or office building , but in a museum . " we chose -lrb- the rheinisches landesmuseum -rrb- as our media and fan center because many of the guests from japan who are coming to bonn during the world cup also want to take a bit of culture back with them , " said masato watanabe , a representative of the japanese football association . g-jamps serves as a central meeting point not only for japanese visitors and journalists but also for anybody interested in the japanese team .
but soccer is just the beginning .
courses , performances and presentations are being offered throughout the world cup in cooperation with the german-japanese society - everything from flower arranging and kimonos to martial arts , go -lrb- a japanese board game -rrb- and origami is on the program . the museum 's restaurant features both japanese and local cuisine and , in the spirit of intercultural understanding , sushi is only on offer when the german team plays . sausage a n d beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans were waiting with pens and hopeful smiles when the team left their hotel to go to practice a japanese beer-maker is an official sponsor of the country 's team and its presence ca n't be overlooked at g-jamps .
but visitors from japan are eager to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know elements of german culture while they are in the country .
it is not surprising that beer and sausage are among the musts . " most of the japanese guests speak good english and those who do n't bring pictures with them of german dishes they would like to try , " said paul hofmann , a server at haus daufenbach .
through connections with the united nations , located in bonn , the combined restaurant and hotel also has numerous guests from other un nations , including yemen , ecuador , and ethiopia . michael thomas from zum gequetschen -lrb- which could be roughly translated as " at the squeezed " -rrb- , a popular restaurant in the city center featuring traditional german cuisine , said that around 50 percent of international guests this month are from japan .

" home comfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sushi and sausage are availabe here at the blue samurai 's media and fan headquarters but heavy german dishes on a daily basis get to be too much after a while .
according to a server at a bonn sushi bar , some of the japanese visitors also search out more familiar tastes in between the sauerkraut and bratwurst . " the japanese noodle house around the corner has many japanese guests , " she said .
" they prefer warm dishes and sushi is more of a snack .
they come here first to eat sushi and then they go over to the noodle house for miso soup , tempura and other warm things . " big stadium or big scree n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising sun is visible all day long in bonn to welcome the team and their fans well nourished , rested and ready to go , blue samurai fans have several options when it comes to watching their team in action .
the best bet is to visit the stadium in bonn , where the team trains .
times are made public and entry is free - quite a deal , considering the hundreds of euros people pay to see the same team in a live game .
the only disadvantage , of course , is the absence of an opponent . those who want to see the games but do n't have tickets can still enjoy the stadium atmosphere by going to the big screen set up on one of bonn 's two large , open market squares .
there the cheapest seat goes for 11 euros -lrb- 13.50 dollars -rrb- , which makes the slightly smaller screen at the pub around the corner look a bit more appealing . megunu and musaku , two soccer fans from japan , were on their way to view the blue samurai during a training session at bonn 's stadium .
they had met as tourists in barcelona and decided to continue on together to germany for the world cup .
when asked about the blue samurai 's performance , musaku did n't beat around the bush . " the players are very good , but the coach is bad , " he said . o n e poi n t for japa n japan 's national coach , zico , is a soccer legend from brazil . " in my opinion it 's better to face brazil in this round rather than later in the k.o. round , " zico was quoted as saying in die zeit .
" better now and then again the finals .
whoever wants to achieve something at the world cup has to be prepared for everything . " after losing to australia last week 3-1 and tying with croatia 0-0 on sunday , the blue samurai will come up against zico 's native brazil on thursday , june 22 at 7 p.m.

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .

currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad .

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate .

in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad .

" grasso told the italian news agency ansa the investigation had uncovered evidence " linking mafia cells with businessmen and politicians , " including a list of candidates in recent elections which the crime group considered reliable . the suspects were captured during a dawn raid by 500 armed officers searching the mediterranean island .
first reports said 52 had been captured , including 13 clan bosses , but later statements revised the figures . some still at-large seven further suspects for whom warrants were issued in palermo were still at large late tuesday as a large-scale operation codenamed " gotha " continued a long-term campaign to smash the mafia 's organized crime network . the 52 arrest warrants issued by anti-mafia investigative magistrates carried charges of extortion and participating in mafia-linked associations . tuesday 's haul included 16 alleged clan chiefs each said to have held sway over his own sector of palermo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 500 armed officers stormed the island they included antonino rotolo , 60 , francesco bonura , 64 , and antonino cina , 61 , whose arrests are considered particularly significant because of their allegedly lead role in running mafia operations . top boss nabbed the arrests follow the capture this spring of the organization 's top boss , a breakthrough for italian police .
bernardo provenzano , 73 , alleged to have been the man at the very pinnacle of the sicilian mafia empire , was arrested on april 11 after 43 years on the run . " the capture of provenzano and all that arose from it gives us a significant advantage for the future of sicily and its democratic life , " said italian interior minister giuliano amato tuesday . " we have n't yet won the war , there 's still a lot to do , " he said .
" the struggle against the mafia continues to be a priority for our country . " modern technology led to arrests grasso said the latest operation was the result of a probe which had enabled police to " piece together the current organizational chart of palermo 's mafia association . " investigators relied on numerous secretly recorded conversations between suspects that took place inside a garage in palermo used as a meeting place .
also used as evidence were documents , later decoded , found among provenzano 's personal things .

dw-world.de talked to both germany 's guests from the land of the rising sun and their hosts . a stroll through the streets of bonn will reveal that many japanese visitors have traveled half way around the world to support their national soccer stars as they face the world 's very best this month in the world cup .
they have chosen to stay in the former german capital for part or all of the month of june because the japanese team also has set up its headquarters here . while all of germany was busy preparing for scores of international guests , bonn focused especially on preparation for the japanese guests to come . g-jamps the team 's official media and fan headquarters - dubbed g-jamps -lrb- germany japan national team media partners supporters -rrb- - is not located in a hotel , stadium or office building , but in a museum . " we chose -lrb- the rheinisches landesmuseum -rrb- as our media and fan center because many of the guests from japan who are coming to bonn during the world cup also want to take a bit of culture back with them , " said masato watanabe , a representative of the japanese football association . g-jamps serves as a central meeting point not only for japanese visitors and journalists but also for anybody interested in the japanese team .
but soccer is just the beginning .
courses , performances and presentations are being offered throughout the world cup in cooperation with the german-japanese society - everything from flower arranging and kimonos to martial arts , go -lrb- a japanese board game -rrb- and origami is on the program . the museum 's restaurant features both japanese and local cuisine and , in the spirit of intercultural understanding , sushi is only on offer when the german team plays . sausage a n d beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans were waiting with pens and hopeful smiles when the team left their hotel to go to practice a japanese beer-maker is an official sponsor of the country 's team and its presence ca n't be overlooked at g-jamps .
but visitors from japan are eager to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know elements of german culture while they are in the country .
it is not surprising that beer and sausage are among the musts . " most of the japanese guests speak good english and those who do n't bring pictures with them of german dishes they would like to try , " said paul hofmann , a server at haus daufenbach .
through connections with the united nations , located in bonn , the combined restaurant and hotel also has numerous guests from other un nations , including yemen , ecuador , and ethiopia . michael thomas from zum gequetschen -lrb- which could be roughly translated as " at the squeezed " -rrb- , a popular restaurant in the city center featuring traditional german cuisine , said that around 50 percent of international guests this month are from japan . " the japanese customers drink less and meals are more communal , " he said .
" they 'll order one dish and four plates and share it . " home comfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sushi and sausage are availabe here at the blue samurai 's media and fan headquarters but heavy german dishes on a daily basis get to be too much after a while .
according to a server at a bonn sushi bar , some of the japanese visitors also search out more familiar tastes in between the sauerkraut and bratwurst . " the japanese noodle house around the corner has many japanese guests , " she said .
" they prefer warm dishes and sushi is more of a snack .
they come here first to eat sushi and then they go over to the noodle house for miso soup , tempura and other warm things . " big stadium or big scree n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rising sun is visible all day long in bonn to welcome the team and their fans well nourished , rested and ready to go , blue samurai fans have several options when it comes to watching their team in action .
the best bet is to visit the stadium in bonn , where the team trains .
times are made public and entry is free - quite a deal , considering the hundreds of euros people pay to see the same team in a live game .
the only disadvantage , of course , is the absence of an opponent . those who want to see the games but do n't have tickets can still enjoy the stadium atmosphere by going to the big screen set up on one of bonn 's two large , open market squares .
there the cheapest seat goes for 11 euros -lrb- 13.50 dollars -rrb- , which makes the slightly smaller screen at the pub around the corner look a bit more appealing . megunu and musaku , two soccer fans from japan , were on their way to view the blue samurai during a training session at bonn 's stadium .
they had met as tourists in barcelona and decided to continue on together to germany for the world cup .
when asked about the blue samurai 's performance , musaku did n't beat around the bush . " the players are very good , but the coach is bad , " he said . o n e poi n t for japa n japan 's national coach , zico , is a soccer legend from brazil . " in my opinion it 's better to face brazil in this round rather than later in the k.o. round , " zico was quoted as saying in die zeit .
" better now and then again the finals .
whoever wants to achieve something at the world cup has to be prepared for everything . " after losing to australia last week 3-1 and tying with croatia 0-0 on sunday , the blue samurai will come up against zico 's native brazil on thursday , june 22 at 7 p.m.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.06.2006 german industry irked by slow pace of reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms in germany are moving at a turtle 's pace , experts complain while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .
they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad . " we have to make sure we gain competitive advantage when it comes to corporate taxes , " böttcher said .
" twenty-five percent should be the orientation mark .
if we leave that until the end of the decade , it will be too late .

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform .

the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .

but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad .

is german soccer legend franz beckenbauer really a human being ?
or is he merely a science fiction invention ?
he does seem capable of beaming himself to different galaxies at the speed of light . sweating at home in front of the tv set watching a world cup game has at least one advantage over sweating collectively at the stadium : you actually get to see more .
after trying to lip-read the obscenities a player is throwing at the referee , you can compare your own beer belly with a horde of face-painted , shirtless soccer freaks .
and still , only a few seconds later , you can hang out with the spanish royal couple or the otherwise sleepy german chancellor trying to get in touch with her inner beast . as you move from game to game and from city to city , you also get to admire one world cup attendee , for whom defying the laws of physics is turning into a favorite pastime .
franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and president of the soccer championship organizing committee , is the only world cup celebrity that seems capable of being at different places at the same time .
you can see him in almost every city , at almost every game .
the man is a genius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer 's bavarian star trek friends so how does he do it ?
is he in possession of an intergalactic star trek beamer ?
did he hire an army of look-alikes ?
or does he have an exclusive deal with overbearing magician david copperfield ? apparently , not .
in-between games , beckenbauer - whose popular teutonic nickname is " kaiser " -lrb- emperor -rrb- - gets to do what most soccer fans would be too drunk to even contemplate at the end of a match .
he hops on augusta 109 , his regally named helicopter , and flies off to wherever his cosmopolitan heart may take him .
hasta la vista , gelsenkirchen !
konichiwa , hamburg ! everywhere you turn the sun-tanned , gray-haired bavarian " emperor " feels to most germans like a friend of the family , not only because he bears visual and dialectological resemblance to bavarian folksy prime minister stoiber , but also because he is no stranger to advertising gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian prime minister stoiber -lrb- or a franz beckenbauer look-alike ? -rrb-
one of his most prolific campaigns has been for a german cell phone provider known for expensive-looking and alluring celebrity ads .
german couch potatoes who have a profound relationship with their remote controls have discovered that there are days on which they can start watching a beckenbauer commercial on one channel , switch to the middle of it on a different channel , and still make it to grand finale on a third . along with veronica ferres - a blond german actress with the spanish sounding name - and anna netrebko - a russian opera diva with the body of a greek goddess - germans have seen beckenbauer do all sorts of things in those commercials : getting bottles out of his wine cellar for a plaster fest with his raucous soccer buddies ; yakking away on his cell phone ; hanging out at the north pole ; mugging the unsuspecting father christmas and even flying in a chopper over soccer-mad germany . helicopters are , it seems , his thing . an imperial catfight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soprano anna netrebko is beckenbauer 's comrade-in-advertising but this is where things get a little complicated with the chopper-flying tsar .
another telecom giant , which practically bought the entire german national soccer league by acquiring exclusive broadcasting rights to its games , is now reportedly planning to hire the " emperor " as its soccer expert for 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- . according to media report , that 's the reason why beckenbauer 's contract with that cell phone provider will most likely end after the world cup .
in the business world , that 's called stiff competition or conflict of interest .
in the real world , it 's called : somebody 's getting jealous .
everybody wants a piece of kaiser franz . and in order to make it all these world cup games without getting stuck in traffic or getting ambushed by gangs of screaming fans , beckenbauer will have to keep flying on board augusta 109 . " when you really want to get to know the country , you need a chopper , " beckenbauer recently told a reporter . emergency landing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention , crew !
his imperial majesty needs to use the loo according to hans ostler , who 's been beckenbauer 's chauffer in the air for the past eight years , the " emperor " is a good passenger .
he usually wants to get from a to b and does n't make a big deal about it . except on those rare but painful occasions , which require an emergency landing : for example , when nature calls .
the " emperor " is - at least as far as his physiological needs are concerned - a mere mortal , after all . " we must take care of everything before takeoff , " beckenbauer said .
" unless it 's really urgent .
in that case we have to land in some forest and then go up again .
it 's happened before .
it sure did . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris hilton 's urge brings fame to bavarian farm it 's usually a simple life for the folks in the rural bavarian hamlet of glonn .

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad . " we have to make sure we gain competitive advantage when it comes to corporate taxes , " böttcher said .
" twenty-five percent should be the orientation mark .
if we leave that until the end of the decade , it will be too late . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

but captain beckham has vowed to lift the title for him . the 26-year-old newcastle star was stretchered off after just one minute of tuesday 's 2-2 draw with sweden in cologne after falling awkwardly to the ground , clutching his knee in agony .
no other player was involved . a scan on wednesday confirmed he had damaged the cruciate ligament in his right knee and his tournament was over .
he could face up to five months on the sidelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : owen winces as his knee is examined by a trainer " obviously it 's a massive blow to suffer the injury and be out of the world cup , " said owen , who has scored 36 goals in his 80 internationals . along with wayne rooney , who against the swedes was starting his first game since breaking his foot in april , owen is england 's only proven goal scorer at the top level . " as soon as it happened i knew i was in trouble , " he said .
" it was a major disappointment to pick up the injury so early in the game .
i 'll go back home now and work with the newcastle medical staff to put a recovery program in place . " beckham vows to lift cup captain david beckham , a former real madrid teammate of owen 's , said the squad was devastated by his injury and vowed to win the world cup for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham has vowed to win the world cup for owen " that 's what we said at half time when we came in and we knew it was a bad injury , " beckham said .

it 's unfortunate for him and for us . " england goalkeeper paul robinson said the team was upset by what had happened . " devastated , we think it is quite a serious one , " robinson said .
" i 'm very disappointed for him and the team as well .
it 's a very unfortunate incident . " owen , who has been plagued by injuries including hamstring trouble and a broken foot for almost a year , looked out of touch in england 's opening games against paraguay and trinidad & tobago . his performance raised questions about whether he would regain the extra pace that makes him so dangerous .
there were even calls for him to be dropped , but eriksson kept faith and owen vowed to prove the doubters wrong against sweden , only to see it all go horribly wrong . eriksso n 's striker headache owen 's injury means england are desperately short of experienced strikers with coach sven-göran eriksson left with a not yet fully-fit wayne rooney , liverpool 's lanky peter crouch and untested arsenal teenager theo walcott . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney was almost unstoppable against sweden walcott has only made one substitutes ' appearance for england , in last month 's friendly win over hungary , and has never played for arsenal since joining them in january . eriksson , whose side face ecuador in stuttgart in the second round on sunday , has been under fire for bringing only four strikers to germany . a squad overloaded with midfielders who are unlikely to play a significant part in england 's campaign - neither michael carrick nor jermaine jenas have yet kicked a ball - always looked unbalanced . nevertheless , eriksson put on a brave face in the immediate aftermath of england 's draw with sweden , insisting that his side have enough options in midfield as well as attack to provide a reliable source of goals . " if you talk about other options , we have many players who can take that second striker role , " he said .
" we have theo walcott , who we have n't seen yet , we have joe cole , we have steven gerrard .
both of them scored fantastic goals .
so i 'm not that worried about it at all . " rooney played against sweden , starting his first game since breaking a bone in his foot on april 29 . he came through unscathed , and looked sharp and dangerous whenever he got the ball . " a big loss for e n gla n d " for the moment , however , eriksson said he concerned with owen 's welfare . " michael has had terrible luck with injuries since christmas , " said the swede .
" i feel very sorry for him to miss out on the rest of the world cup - it 's a blow to him and a big loss for the team .
however i am sure michael will work very hard to get back as quickly as possible for newcastle and england .
he is a true professional and a very mentally strong person .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.06.2006 german industry irked by slow pace of reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms in germany are moving at a turtle 's pace , experts complain while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .
they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system .

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate .

in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .
but according to thumann , this difficulty is no excuse for political hemming and hawing over much-needed reforms . " we , the bdi and our members are starting to get rather impatient , " he told reporters in berlin on monday .
" impatient because the political debate in germany has hardly yielded any results yet , impatient because of many political decisions we think are wrong , impatient because of a stagnation we ca n't afford . " a good start the criticism is all the more striking given the fact that business leaders , thumann included , were well-disposed toward merkel and her economic platform during her government 's first few months . " they had a good start with their economic policy if you consider that they embarked on a budget consolidation process , and decided to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 , which was an unpopular but necessary decision , " said barbara böttcher , economist with deutsche bank 's think tank , db research . " now , they seem to have run into deeper waters with the reform of -lrb- unemployment benefit legislation -rrb- hartz iv , health care sector reforms , and corporate tax reform . " böttcher said that merkel would likely be making swifter progress had her christian democrats been able to form a coalition with the free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , as planned .
instead , she has to work on maintaining harmony with the more traditionally leftist wing of the social democratic party , which gained in influence following the departure of gerhard schröder , a reform-minded moderate . " the constraints now are much stronger than anticipated , " böttcher said . recipe for success germany 's economy is not performing too badly at the moment .
in fact , much of the news is downright positive .
both export and domestic industry are doing well , consumer spending is up , and investment in germany is improving .
the bdi reports that the german economy will likely grow by 2 percent this year , and thumann added that it would be possible to repeat this in 2007 - if economic reforms are put in place . thumann 's list of necessary reforms includes loosening job protection rules , cutting corporate taxes , and simplifying the country 's federal structure which has hampered reforms in the past . thumann is not alone .
axel weber , president of germany 's central bank , has called on the government to put new concepts for pension reform on the table as quickly as possible .
and over the weekend , german president horst köhler warned the government of the need to combat stubborn mass unemployment with decisive reforms , and to simplify the german tax system . " i often ask myself why german politicians are so timid , " thumann said , adding that improved business confidence levels plus the majority held by merkel 's coalition have created the ideal conditions to introduce ambitious reforms . keeping up with the joneses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers will have to get used to higher vat starting in 2007 " ambitious " may be one way of describing the government 's recent decision to increase value-added tax by 3 percentage points to 19 percent starting in 2007 .
but it was a move that was widely panned by economic experts who predict it will dampen consumer spending just as it is starting to recover . economists are hoping for better results from the government 's plans to revamp the country 's corporate tax regulations .
finance minister peer steinbrück has announced " the outline of a plan to lower corporate dues to below 30 percent " by 2008 .
currently , companies pay 36.8 percent on profit compared with 15 percent in ireland and 17.4 percent in poland . but industry leaders and economists say the government needs to aim even lower if it wants to stem the export of jobs abroad . " we have to make sure we gain competitive advantage when it comes to corporate taxes , " böttcher said .
" twenty-five percent should be the orientation mark .

is german soccer legend franz beckenbauer really a human being ?
or is he merely a science fiction invention ?
he does seem capable of beaming himself to different galaxies at the speed of light . sweating at home in front of the tv set watching a world cup game has at least one advantage over sweating collectively at the stadium : you actually get to see more .
after trying to lip-read the obscenities a player is throwing at the referee , you can compare your own beer belly with a horde of face-painted , shirtless soccer freaks .
and still , only a few seconds later , you can hang out with the spanish royal couple or the otherwise sleepy german chancellor trying to get in touch with her inner beast . as you move from game to game and from city to city , you also get to admire one world cup attendee , for whom defying the laws of physics is turning into a favorite pastime .
franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and president of the soccer championship organizing committee , is the only world cup celebrity that seems capable of being at different places at the same time .
you can see him in almost every city , at almost every game .
the man is a genius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer 's bavarian star trek friends so how does he do it ?
is he in possession of an intergalactic star trek beamer ?
did he hire an army of look-alikes ?
or does he have an exclusive deal with overbearing magician david copperfield ? apparently , not .
in-between games , beckenbauer - whose popular teutonic nickname is " kaiser " -lrb- emperor -rrb- - gets to do what most soccer fans would be too drunk to even contemplate at the end of a match .
he hops on augusta 109 , his regally named helicopter , and flies off to wherever his cosmopolitan heart may take him .
hasta la vista , gelsenkirchen !
konichiwa , hamburg ! everywhere you turn the sun-tanned , gray-haired bavarian " emperor " feels to most germans like a friend of the family , not only because he bears visual and dialectological resemblance to bavarian folksy prime minister stoiber , but also because he is no stranger to advertising gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian prime minister stoiber -lrb- or a franz beckenbauer look-alike ? -rrb-
one of his most prolific campaigns has been for a german cell phone provider known for expensive-looking and alluring celebrity ads .
german couch potatoes who have a profound relationship with their remote controls have discovered that there are days on which they can start watching a beckenbauer commercial on one channel , switch to the middle of it on a different channel , and still make it to grand finale on a third . along with veronica ferres - a blond german actress with the spanish sounding name - and anna netrebko - a russian opera diva with the body of a greek goddess - germans have seen beckenbauer do all sorts of things in those commercials : getting bottles out of his wine cellar for a plaster fest with his raucous soccer buddies ; yakking away on his cell phone ; hanging out at the north pole ; mugging the unsuspecting father christmas and even flying in a chopper over soccer-mad germany . helicopters are , it seems , his thing . an imperial catfight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soprano anna netrebko is beckenbauer 's comrade-in-advertising but this is where things get a little complicated with the chopper-flying tsar .
another telecom giant , which practically bought the entire german national soccer league by acquiring exclusive broadcasting rights to its games , is now reportedly planning to hire the " emperor " as its soccer expert for 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- . according to media report , that 's the reason why beckenbauer 's contract with that cell phone provider will most likely end after the world cup .
in the business world , that 's called stiff competition or conflict of interest .
in the real world , it 's called : somebody 's getting jealous .
everybody wants a piece of kaiser franz . and in order to make it all these world cup games without getting stuck in traffic or getting ambushed by gangs of screaming fans , beckenbauer will have to keep flying on board augusta 109 . " when you really want to get to know the country , you need a chopper , " beckenbauer recently told a reporter . emergency landing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention , crew !
his imperial majesty needs to use the loo according to hans ostler , who 's been beckenbauer 's chauffer in the air for the past eight years , the " emperor " is a good passenger .
he usually wants to get from a to b and does n't make a big deal about it . except on those rare but painful occasions , which require an emergency landing : for example , when nature calls .
the " emperor " is - at least as far as his physiological needs are concerned - a mere mortal , after all . " we must take care of everything before takeoff , " beckenbauer said .
" unless it 's really urgent .
in that case we have to land in some forest and then go up again .
it 's happened before .
it sure did . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris hilton 's urge brings fame to bavarian farm it 's usually a simple life for the folks in the rural bavarian hamlet of glonn .

he does seem capable of beaming himself to different galaxies at the speed of light . sweating at home in front of the tv set watching a world cup game has at least one advantage over sweating collectively at the stadium : you actually get to see more .
after trying to lip-read the obscenities a player is throwing at the referee , you can compare your own beer belly with a horde of face-painted , shirtless soccer freaks .
and still , only a few seconds later , you can hang out with the spanish royal couple or the otherwise sleepy german chancellor trying to get in touch with her inner beast . as you move from game to game and from city to city , you also get to admire one world cup attendee , for whom defying the laws of physics is turning into a favorite pastime .
franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and president of the soccer championship organizing committee , is the only world cup celebrity that seems capable of being at different places at the same time .
you can see him in almost every city , at almost every game .
the man is a genius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer 's bavarian star trek friends so how does he do it ?
is he in possession of an intergalactic star trek beamer ?
did he hire an army of look-alikes ?
or does he have an exclusive deal with overbearing magician david copperfield ? apparently , not .
in-between games , beckenbauer - whose popular teutonic nickname is " kaiser " -lrb- emperor -rrb- - gets to do what most soccer fans would be too drunk to even contemplate at the end of a match .
he hops on augusta 109 , his regally named helicopter , and flies off to wherever his cosmopolitan heart may take him .
hasta la vista , gelsenkirchen !
konichiwa , hamburg ! everywhere you turn the sun-tanned , gray-haired bavarian " emperor " feels to most germans like a friend of the family , not only because he bears visual and dialectological resemblance to bavarian folksy prime minister stoiber , but also because he is no stranger to advertising gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian prime minister stoiber -lrb- or a franz beckenbauer look-alike ? -rrb-
one of his most prolific campaigns has been for a german cell phone provider known for expensive-looking and alluring celebrity ads .
german couch potatoes who have a profound relationship with their remote controls have discovered that there are days on which they can start watching a beckenbauer commercial on one channel , switch to the middle of it on a different channel , and still make it to grand finale on a third . along with veronica ferres - a blond german actress with the spanish sounding name - and anna netrebko - a russian opera diva with the body of a greek goddess - germans have seen beckenbauer do all sorts of things in those commercials : getting bottles out of his wine cellar for a plaster fest with his raucous soccer buddies ; yakking away on his cell phone ; hanging out at the north pole ; mugging the unsuspecting father christmas and even flying in a chopper over soccer-mad germany . helicopters are , it seems , his thing . an imperial catfight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soprano anna netrebko is beckenbauer 's comrade-in-advertising but this is where things get a little complicated with the chopper-flying tsar .
another telecom giant , which practically bought the entire german national soccer league by acquiring exclusive broadcasting rights to its games , is now reportedly planning to hire the " emperor " as its soccer expert for 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- . according to media report , that 's the reason why beckenbauer 's contract with that cell phone provider will most likely end after the world cup .
in the business world , that 's called stiff competition or conflict of interest .
in the real world , it 's called : somebody 's getting jealous .
everybody wants a piece of kaiser franz . and in order to make it all these world cup games without getting stuck in traffic or getting ambushed by gangs of screaming fans , beckenbauer will have to keep flying on board augusta 109 . " when you really want to get to know the country , you need a chopper , " beckenbauer recently told a reporter . emergency landing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention , crew !
his imperial majesty needs to use the loo according to hans ostler , who 's been beckenbauer 's chauffer in the air for the past eight years , the " emperor " is a good passenger .
he usually wants to get from a to b and does n't make a big deal about it . except on those rare but painful occasions , which require an emergency landing : for example , when nature calls .
the " emperor " is - at least as far as his physiological needs are concerned - a mere mortal , after all . " we must take care of everything before takeoff , " beckenbauer said .
" unless it 's really urgent .
in that case we have to land in some forest and then go up again .
it 's happened before .
it sure did . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris hilton 's urge brings fame to bavarian farm it 's usually a simple life for the folks in the rural bavarian hamlet of glonn .
but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity .

world cup soccer players seeking to ease aching muscles after a match would probably do better to guzzle fresh cherry juice instead , according to a study published in the british journal of sports medicine . researchers in the united states asked volunteers to drink either juice made from a tart , fresh cherry juice mixed with commercial apple juice , or a look-alike mixture that contained no cherry juice .
the 14 guinea pigs drank the stuff for three days before undergoing a bout of exercise in which arm muscles were flexed 40 times on a weight-lifting machine , and drank it for four days afterward .
the process was repeated two weeks later .
those who had taken the dummy mixture took the cherry juice instead and vice versa .
the other arm was also used . muscle tenderness , motion and strength were assessed on each of the days before and after exercise , using standard test equipment .
the volunteers also rated their own muscle soreness on a scale of 1 to 10 .
those who had been drinking the dummy mixture saw their muscle strength plunge by 22 percent after the exercise .
but the loss was only four percentage points among those who had been drinking cherry juice .
and among the cherry drinkers , muscle strength even improved slightly 96 hours after the exercise . the finding supports previous research which shows that tart cherries are stuffed with natural anti-inflammatory agents and antioxidants , which prevent cell damage . more briefs 21.06.2006 -pipe- nostrodamus backs spain to win the world cup 20.06.2006 -pipe- world cup losses undermine stock markets 20.06.2006 -pipe- blair bids to help world cup ticket scam children 20.06.2006 -pipe- germany wins robocup 19.06.2006 -pipe- france in despair , say press 19.06.2006 -pipe- posh , wags go on shopping spree in baden-baden 18.06.2006 -pipe- german police downgrade maradona 's speeding fine 18.06.2006 -pipe- german newspaper claims world cup improves sex lives dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

just six minutes into the game , maniche supplied simao sabrosa , who made a great run on the left and passed back to maniche who struck home from close range . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico goalie oswaldo sanchez capitulates as portugal 's simao scores portugal then increased their lead after 24 minutes when mexico 's captain rafael marquez handled the ball in the area .

" ten wins in the world cup is the kind of thing that would mark anybody 's life , especially mine , " the brazilian said . iran hold angola to draw to end world cup dreams in the group 's other game , iran dominated the first half against angola who needed a win and help from portugal to have any chance of progressing to the next round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angola 's akwa in a duel for the ball with iran 's sohrab bakhtiarizadeh angola took the lead in the 60th minute through flavio and with portugal ahead against mexico only goal difference separated them from a place in the round of the last sixteen . but iranian defender sohrab bakhtiarizadeh headed firmly home in the 75th minute to seal the draw and end angola 's hopes . dw staff -lrb- jm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deco and ronaldo break iran 's resolve as portugal win 2-0 portugal qualified for the world cup knock-out stages for the first time in 40 years on saturday with a 2-0 win over iran .

they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for . angela merkel may be enjoying the highest popularity ratings of any post-war german chancellor , but she is fast losing favor among the country 's business leaders and economic experts . at a meeting of industry representatives in berlin on tuesday , the president of the bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , renewed his stinging criticism of merkel 's reform politics and demanded that her grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats pick up the pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is losing favor with the bdi industry association the difficulty she would have in leading this unwieldy coalition of former political opponents was well noted when merkel took office .

franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and president of the soccer championship organizing committee , is the only world cup celebrity that seems capable of being at different places at the same time .
you can see him in almost every city , at almost every game .
the man is a genius . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer 's bavarian star trek friends so how does he do it ?
is he in possession of an intergalactic star trek beamer ?
did he hire an army of look-alikes ?
or does he have an exclusive deal with overbearing magician david copperfield ? apparently , not .
in-between games , beckenbauer - whose popular teutonic nickname is " kaiser " -lrb- emperor -rrb- - gets to do what most soccer fans would be too drunk to even contemplate at the end of a match .
he hops on augusta 109 , his regally named helicopter , and flies off to wherever his cosmopolitan heart may take him .
hasta la vista , gelsenkirchen !
konichiwa , hamburg ! everywhere you turn the sun-tanned , gray-haired bavarian " emperor " feels to most germans like a friend of the family , not only because he bears visual and dialectological resemblance to bavarian folksy prime minister stoiber , but also because he is no stranger to advertising gigs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian prime minister stoiber -lrb- or a franz beckenbauer look-alike ? -rrb-
one of his most prolific campaigns has been for a german cell phone provider known for expensive-looking and alluring celebrity ads .
german couch potatoes who have a profound relationship with their remote controls have discovered that there are days on which they can start watching a beckenbauer commercial on one channel , switch to the middle of it on a different channel , and still make it to grand finale on a third . along with veronica ferres - a blond german actress with the spanish sounding name - and anna netrebko - a russian opera diva with the body of a greek goddess - germans have seen beckenbauer do all sorts of things in those commercials : getting bottles out of his wine cellar for a plaster fest with his raucous soccer buddies ; yakking away on his cell phone ; hanging out at the north pole ; mugging the unsuspecting father christmas and even flying in a chopper over soccer-mad germany . helicopters are , it seems , his thing . an imperial catfight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian soprano anna netrebko is beckenbauer 's comrade-in-advertising but this is where things get a little complicated with the chopper-flying tsar .
another telecom giant , which practically bought the entire german national soccer league by acquiring exclusive broadcasting rights to its games , is now reportedly planning to hire the " emperor " as its soccer expert for 15 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- . according to media report , that 's the reason why beckenbauer 's contract with that cell phone provider will most likely end after the world cup .
in the business world , that 's called stiff competition or conflict of interest .
in the real world , it 's called : somebody 's getting jealous .
everybody wants a piece of kaiser franz . and in order to make it all these world cup games without getting stuck in traffic or getting ambushed by gangs of screaming fans , beckenbauer will have to keep flying on board augusta 109 . " when you really want to get to know the country , you need a chopper , " beckenbauer recently told a reporter . emergency landing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention , crew !
his imperial majesty needs to use the loo according to hans ostler , who 's been beckenbauer 's chauffer in the air for the past eight years , the " emperor " is a good passenger .
he usually wants to get from a to b and does n't make a big deal about it . except on those rare but painful occasions , which require an emergency landing : for example , when nature calls .
the " emperor " is - at least as far as his physiological needs are concerned - a mere mortal , after all . " we must take care of everything before takeoff , " beckenbauer said .
" unless it 's really urgent .
in that case we have to land in some forest and then go up again .
it 's happened before .
it sure did . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris hilton 's urge brings fame to bavarian farm it 's usually a simple life for the folks in the rural bavarian hamlet of glonn .
but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity .

" an expedition to european digital cultural heritage " - a two-day international conference on digitalizing europe 's cultural legacy - opened on tuesday in the austrian city of salzburg . the conference , organized under the patronage of the austrian presidency over the european union , focuses on the strategies of long-term preservation of european cultural and scientific resources and the ways in which technology as well as policy can help in the process of collecting , connecting and communicating our cultural memory . the conference is meant to contribute to the open debate between research communities and heritage institutions such as libraries and museums , on the one hand , and multimedia entrepreneurs , technology providers and policy makers , on the other . making the past available in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european archives contain a wealth of important , but largely inaccessible documents recognizing the importance of new technologies , the eu commission has designed a strategy called i2010 to promote the development of information society in europe across national and linguistic borders . the goal of the agenda i2010 is the creation of the so-called common european information space , in which european citizens will be able to access and share on the internet a wealth of written and audio-visual materials and services , regardless of which country they come from . participants in the salzburg conference will be paying particular attention to the essential part of the common european information space - the european digital library .
two million books , films , photographs , manuscripts and other works should be online through the library by 2008 , and the figure is expected to rise to six million by 2010 as more and more libraries , archives and museums plug in . a cultural utopia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " an expedition to european digital cultural heritage " is taking place in salzburg , austria this titanic project is an attempt to address the cultural paradox of the internet age : the more data is available , the more difficult it becomes to access it .
estimates show than the amount of new information produced in the year 2002 alone - 5 billion gigabytes - is 37,000 times larger than the holdings of the us library of congress , the world 's largest library . us internet search giant google triggered an international race to build an online library when it announced plans in december 2004 to digitize books and documents from a handful of big libraries . us internet and software giants yahoo , microsoft and amazon have since announced separate plans while france , angry that private companies took the lead and concerned about the us-american domination in the field , has pushed for the creation of a public digital library . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to allow opening of huge holocaust archive germany agreed tuesday to support opening a massive trove of world war ii records on 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime , after six decades of highly restricted access .

a conference in salzburg , austria is looking for answers . " an expedition to european digital cultural heritage " - a two-day international conference on digitalizing europe 's cultural legacy - opened on tuesday in the austrian city of salzburg . the conference , organized under the patronage of the austrian presidency over the european union , focuses on the strategies of long-term preservation of european cultural and scientific resources and the ways in which technology as well as policy can help in the process of collecting , connecting and communicating our cultural memory . the conference is meant to contribute to the open debate between research communities and heritage institutions such as libraries and museums , on the one hand , and multimedia entrepreneurs , technology providers and policy makers , on the other . making the past available in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european archives contain a wealth of important , but largely inaccessible documents recognizing the importance of new technologies , the eu commission has designed a strategy called i2010 to promote the development of information society in europe across national and linguistic borders . the goal of the agenda i2010 is the creation of the so-called common european information space , in which european citizens will be able to access and share on the internet a wealth of written and audio-visual materials and services , regardless of which country they come from . participants in the salzburg conference will be paying particular attention to the essential part of the common european information space - the european digital library .

what are the implications of new technologies on the european cultural scene ?
a conference in salzburg , austria is looking for answers . " an expedition to european digital cultural heritage " - a two-day international conference on digitalizing europe 's cultural legacy - opened on tuesday in the austrian city of salzburg . the conference , organized under the patronage of the austrian presidency over the european union , focuses on the strategies of long-term preservation of european cultural and scientific resources and the ways in which technology as well as policy can help in the process of collecting , connecting and communicating our cultural memory . the conference is meant to contribute to the open debate between research communities and heritage institutions such as libraries and museums , on the one hand , and multimedia entrepreneurs , technology providers and policy makers , on the other . making the past available in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european archives contain a wealth of important , but largely inaccessible documents recognizing the importance of new technologies , the eu commission has designed a strategy called i2010 to promote the development of information society in europe across national and linguistic borders . the goal of the agenda i2010 is the creation of the so-called common european information space , in which european citizens will be able to access and share on the internet a wealth of written and audio-visual materials and services , regardless of which country they come from . participants in the salzburg conference will be paying particular attention to the essential part of the common european information space - the european digital library .
two million books , films , photographs , manuscripts and other works should be online through the library by 2008 , and the figure is expected to rise to six million by 2010 as more and more libraries , archives and museums plug in . a cultural utopia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " an expedition to european digital cultural heritage " is taking place in salzburg , austria this titanic project is an attempt to address the cultural paradox of the internet age : the more data is available , the more difficult it becomes to access it .

for some , the players ' haircuts are the most closely watched trend at the world cup . italy 's brush with the scissors and a bid for fame from a plucky african outsider has kept tongues wagging in hairdressers ' salons all over the globe . after years when flowing locks have been the norm , italy have adopted the old adage that less is more . golden boy francesco totti , who had long cultivated a luxuriant bobbed style , appeared for his country 's opening match against ghana newly cropped . a spidery do after two weeks of matches , the tournament has arguably thrown up only one truly memorable haircut - and it came from world cup first-timers angola and their extraordinarily-coiffured defender loco .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is that a spider on loco 's forehead ? possibly in homage to the unusual " half moon " cut sported by ronaldo as brazil cruised to the title in 2002 , loco has shaved his entire head except for a dreadlocked patch at the front . the effect is of a hairy spider perching on his forehead . running him a close second is the variation on the mohawk , which germany 's rising midfield star bastian schweinsteiger is sporting to the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tabloids have compared schweinsteiger 's hairdo to a toilet brush the hair on the sides is shaved short , but the strip down the middle of his head is bushy , earning him the nickname " brushhead " in the german tabloids .
not everyone liked it . " i hope it 'll grow back , or there 'll be trouble , " said uli hoeness , the no-nonsense general manager of his club bayern munich . the ponytail days are over one trend from this world cup : the ponytail is a dying phenomenon .
sweden 's christian wilhelmsson has stubbornly persisted with the style , even adding a few blonde streaks for maximum effect , although pairing it with a spiky cut was perhaps taking it too far . world cup history is littered with memorable haircut moments .
in 1998 , romania showed true team spirit when their entire lineup were bleached blond .
2002 was the year of the homemade mohawk , as sported by turkey 's umit davala , us striker clint mathis and german defender christian ziege - at least until the mockery from his teammates persuaded him to shave it off . players ' sporting more conservative hairstyles a poll of hairdressers in one of the world cup host cities , hanover , revealed disappointment at the players ' lack of adventure this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham has sported some unusual hairstyles over the years " there were a lot more strange haircuts in 2002 , " said one stylist , luca .
" now a lot of the players just brush it forward like david beckham . " beckham once changed his hairstyle so often that the manufacturers of his replica doll tried to take out insurance - the minute they had churned out a new doll , becks had been to the salon again . but the advancing years appear to be making the 31-year-old father-of-three conservative , and the face that has adorned a thousand magazine covers has been framed by a relatively unchanging blondish mop for at least 12 months . helping hair indeed beckham 's limelight was stolen by marco rodriguez , the mexican referee for england 's game against paraguay , whose slicked-back appearance and scarlet jersey made him look as if he was heading for the dance floor at the final whistle . one player who might be regretting his style is trinidad and tobago 's brent sancho .
england 's tall striker peter crouch grabbed his dreadlocks to give him extra leverage as he jumped to head home the first goal in a 2-0 win . and no-one will forget tunisian defender anis ayari 's name , but not unfortunately because of his appearance - he had two as shaved into his hair . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : interviews with the stars hear what the people on the field have to say about their favorites for the 2006 world cup .

buglife , which campaigns to protect endangered insects , says 250 of the uk 's 4,000 species of beetle have not been seen since the 1970s .
the charity says it is vital for other animals that the variety of beetle-life is maintained , and " imperative " that action is taken now to protect them .
it warns that habitat decline means many species may already be extinct .
conservationists say beetles play a unique and vital role in the planet 's ecosystems , including burying the corpses of dead animals and pollinating flowers .
but some species have not been observed for years in the uk .
for example , the sussex diving beetle was common in the lewes levels in the 1970s but was last spotted in 2002 .
buglife director matt shadlow told bbc news the problems facing beetles had been indicated by research into other invertebrates , such as butterflies and moths , for which better data existed .
" the data on butterflies and moths suggests that 70 % of the species that occur in the uk are currently in decline , " he said .
" and in fact even with the butterflies , recent butterfly conservation data shows that in the last 10 years alone , we 've lost a third of all our butterflies from the countryside .
" other invertebrates seem to be suffering very badly ; so it 's not surprising that when we look at the beetles , we find that there 're problems there as well . "
he said it was " imperative " immediate action was taken to preserve the astonishing variety of british beetles before it was too late .

the charity says it is vital for other animals that the variety of beetle-life is maintained , and " imperative " that action is taken now to protect them .
it warns that habitat decline means many species may already be extinct .
conservationists say beetles play a unique and vital role in the planet 's ecosystems , including burying the corpses of dead animals and pollinating flowers .
but some species have not been observed for years in the uk .
for example , the sussex diving beetle was common in the lewes levels in the 1970s but was last spotted in 2002 .
buglife director matt shadlow told bbc news the problems facing beetles had been indicated by research into other invertebrates , such as butterflies and moths , for which better data existed .
" the data on butterflies and moths suggests that 70 % of the species that occur in the uk are currently in decline , " he said .
" and in fact even with the butterflies , recent butterfly conservation data shows that in the last 10 years alone , we 've lost a third of all our butterflies from the countryside .
" other invertebrates seem to be suffering very badly ; so it 's not surprising that when we look at the beetles , we find that there 're problems there as well . "
he said it was " imperative " immediate action was taken to preserve the astonishing variety of british beetles before it was too late .

japan says some anti-whaling nations are softening their stance .
and the anti-whaling us is talking of working with whaling nations to make the practice more sustainable .
but environmental groups are firmly against any compromise and are urging anti-whaling countries to stand firm against a return to commercial hunting .
some are planning new campaigns to increase public awareness .
' little achieved ' harking back to the " save the whales " campaigns of the past which ushered in the current global ban on commercial hunting , the new mantra appears to be " save the whales - again " .
there is general disappointment in the environmental community that this meeting has seen anti-whaling countries on the defensive .
" regardless of the rhetoric and posturing , very little has been achieved for either whales or people this week , " said sue lieberman , director of the global species programme at wwf .
" nearly 2,000 whales have been killed by japan , norway and iceland since last year 's meeting - where is conservation ? "
mike townsley of greenpeace , who found himself arrested along with nine other activists while attempting to hold a demonstration on the beach outside the iwc conference hotel , added : " we 've got to remember that although nothing really bad happened , nothing good happened either .
" this year in december , the southern ocean sanctuary will be breached again by the japanese so-called scientific whaling fleet . "
despite comments by japan that it will seek to find ways of protecting its ships against greenpeace 's operations , the environmental group says it will be back in the southern ocean next season .
moving together ?
although environmental groups remain almost entirely united against a return to commercial whaling , there were signs emerging that some nations are prepared to work together towards a compromise .
" i think we are sensing a slight change of attitude among -lsb- anti-whaling -rsb- member countries of the iwc , " said joji morishita , deputy whaling commissioner for japan .
the country gained an important symbolic victory on sunday with the adoption by just one vote of the st kitts declaration , a resolution endorsing an eventual return to commercial whaling .
" because the sustainable-use side had the st kitts declaration adopted , there is more willingness to talk about the compromise or middle ground , " mr morishita told the bbc news website .
" i would definitely like to encourage that willingness for next year 's meeting in anchorage . "
if japan is willing to talk , so is the united states .
its whaling commissioner william hogarth said that although the us remained opposed to commercial whaling , it is prepared to work with pro-whaling nations to ensure that if the ban is eventually lifted , hunting would be conducted along sustainable lines .
the current situation , he indicated , could not be allowed to endure .
" the bottom line is that the number of whales taken is increasing ; it increased by 1,000 between 2005 and 2006 , " he told reporters .
" and so the goal should be to put a process in place that will protect the whales and make sure that any removal will not impede their recovery or cause a return to the position they were in -lsb- before the ban -rsb- . "
business as usual what appears certain is that the three countries which currently catch whales will continue for the foreseeable future , unmoved by the protestations of environmental groups .
beach activists detained norway lodged an objection against the moratorium at its inception , and is allowed to catch minke whales commercially .
" norway 's intention is to continue to develop commercial whaling , " commented rune frovik , secretary of the high north alliance , which promotes the interests of whalers and fishermen in the north of norway .
" it will probably increase the quota in the coming years , and perhaps other species will be added , " he told the bbc news website .
" but that depends on the scientific work that 's done and also on the market conditions - we need access to the japanese market , and that 's what we think is paramount . "
japan and iceland hunt under an article in the whaling convention allowing catches for scientific research .
indigenous groups , principally around the arctic , take smaller numbers for local consumption .
quotas for these indigenous groups are due for review at next year 's iwc meeting in anchorage , when the us will take its turn to chair the commission .
by then the anti-whaling bloc will probably be stronger , boosted by the extra number of countries which european delegates hope to bring onto the iwc now that the whalers have had their victory .

japan says some anti-whaling nations are softening their stance .
and the anti-whaling us is talking of working with whaling nations to make the practice more sustainable .
but environmental groups are firmly against any compromise and are urging anti-whaling countries to stand firm against a return to commercial hunting .
some are planning new campaigns to increase public awareness .
' little achieved ' harking back to the " save the whales " campaigns of the past which ushered in the current global ban on commercial hunting , the new mantra appears to be " save the whales - again " .
there is general disappointment in the environmental community that this meeting has seen anti-whaling countries on the defensive .
environmentalists are urging anti-whaling nations to stand firm " regardless of the rhetoric and posturing , very little has been achieved for either whales or people this week , " said sue lieberman , director of the global species programme at wwf .
" nearly 2,000 whales have been killed by japan , norway and iceland since last year 's meeting - where is conservation ? "
mike townsley of greenpeace , who found himself arrested along with nine other activists while attempting to hold a demonstration on the beach outside the iwc conference hotel , added : " we 've got to remember that although nothing really bad happened , nothing good happened either .
" this year in december , the southern ocean sanctuary will be breached again by the japanese so-called scientific whaling fleet . "
despite comments by japan that it will seek to find ways of protecting its ships against greenpeace 's operations , the environmental group says it will be back in the southern ocean next season .
moving together ?
although environmental groups remain almost entirely united against a return to commercial whaling , there were signs emerging that some nations are prepared to work together towards a compromise .
japan 's negotiator says there is willingness to discuss compromise " i think we are sensing a slight change of attitude among -lsb- anti-whaling -rsb- member countries of the iwc , " said joji morishita , deputy whaling commissioner for japan .
the country gained an important symbolic victory on sunday with the adoption by just one vote of the st kitts declaration , a resolution endorsing an eventual return to commercial whaling .
" because the sustainable-use side had the st kitts declaration adopted , there is more willingness to talk about the compromise or middle ground , " mr morishita told the bbc news website .
" i would definitely like to encourage that willingness for next year 's meeting in anchorage . "
if japan is willing to talk , so is the united states .
its whaling commissioner william hogarth said that although the us remained opposed to commercial whaling , it is prepared to work with pro-whaling nations to ensure that if the ban is eventually lifted , hunting would be conducted along sustainable lines .
the current situation , he indicated , could not be allowed to endure .
" the bottom line is that the number of whales taken is increasing ; it increased by 1,000 between 2005 and 2006 , " he told reporters .
" and so the goal should be to put a process in place that will protect the whales and make sure that any removal will not impede their recovery or cause a return to the position they were in -lsb- before the ban -rsb- . "
business as usual what appears certain is that the three countries which currently catch whales will continue for the foreseeable future , unmoved by the protestations of environmental groups .
guide to whale species beach activists detained norway lodged an objection against the moratorium at its inception , and is allowed to catch minke whales commercially .
" norway 's intention is to continue to develop commercial whaling , " commented rune frovik , secretary of the high north alliance , which promotes the interests of whalers and fishermen in the north of norway .
" it will probably increase the quota in the coming years , and perhaps other species will be added , " he told the bbc news website .
" but that depends on the scientific work that 's done and also on the market conditions - we need access to the japanese market , and that 's what we think is paramount . "
japan and iceland hunt under an article in the whaling convention allowing catches for scientific research .
indigenous groups , principally around the arctic , take smaller numbers for local consumption .
quotas for these indigenous groups are due for review at next year 's iwc meeting in anchorage , when the us will take its turn to chair the commission .
by then the anti-whaling bloc will probably be stronger , boosted by the extra number of countries which european delegates hope to bring onto the iwc now that the whalers have had their victory .

the 20-minute alignment of the sun will occur on only a few days this week at the bryn celli ddu chamber on anglesey .
the video of the summer solstice at the 5,000-year-old chamber will form part of a museum exhibition in cardiff .
archaeologist steve burrow made the discovery after reading a book by sir norman lockyear published almost 100 years ago . "
when the sun shines through , you feel the site around you - it is an extremely elating moment " dr steve burrow mr burrow said : " the sun does n't move that much on the days around the solstice .
" last year i spent six days going up there , on the last day we managed to get it - the weather was a bit dodgy .
" it was absolutely incredible , " he said .
sir norman - the man who discovered helium - had travelled to the site , otherwise known as the hill of black grove , and measured the alignment of the sun at easter .
" i came across this reference in a book dating back to 1908 but nobody had checked it , nobody had gone and verified it in person , " he said .
" the anticipation on my part was incredible , i was n't sure until it actually happened .
it 's definitely a very personal thing , i think .
light shimmer " there is a very tall pillar stone within the mound which is never illuminated , it is like having a companion with you .
" when the sun shines through , you feel the site around you .
it is an extremely elating moment .
" 5,000 years ago they had the sophistication to build this monument , " he added .
the solstice starts with a blink of light which shimmers and grows more intense until it shines through the burial chamber .
mr burrow said human remains , which would have been placed in the chamber , would have been illuminated by the sun .
" the bones would have been almost warmed by the sun , " he said .
mr burrow , a curator of neolithic archaeology at the national museum of wales , delayed his book by a year to test the theory .
his book tomb builders , published on wednesday , explores the megalithic tombs which remain in wales .
its launch coincides with exhibition death in wales : 4000-3000 bc , which is showing at the national museum cardiff until 24 september .

but the pentagon refused to confirm or deny reports that it had activated its missile defence system in response .
the us ambassador to japan hinted that the missile could be shot down .
amid growing pressure on pyongyang , former south korean president kim dae-jung cancelled a planned trip to the north korean capital .
the north has asserted its right to conduct missile tests , and said it was no longer bound by a 1999 moratorium or a 2002 agreement with japan .
n korea 's missile programme fresh tensions over ' test ' but it is also reportedly calling for talks with washington to resolve the issue , which analysts said suggested north korea was trying to use the row for wider , diplomatic purposes .
george bush 's national security adviser stephen hadley said on tuesday that north korea appeared to be moving towards a missile launch , although " the intelligence is not conclusive at this point " .
he said it was " hard to tell " whether the country had finished fuelling a taepodong-2 , a missile thought capable of reaching us territory .
" there tends to be a desire to create a sense of crisis , " he said .
the comments came after unnamed us officials had been quoted as saying that america 's missile defence system had now been activated .
but the pentagon says it does not comment on the status of the system .
how us missile shield works the white house has refused to say what action the us might take if the missile is launched .
the us ambassador to japan , thomas schieffer , said on wednesday that the us had a greater capacity to track missiles than in 1998 , when north korea last launched a long-range missile .
asked if the us would shoot down a missile , he said : " we have options that we have not had in the past , and all these options are on the table " .
the bbc 's jonathan beale in washington says shooting a missile down would be only likely to escalate tensions .
trip cancelled japan , australia , china and south korea have repeatedly called on north korea to abandon any launch plans .
south korea warned that thousands of tons of food aid would be at risk if the launch went ahead .
have your say " this is a case of north korea 's typical brinksmanship foreign policy . "
shaun carr , new york , usa send us your comments officials in seoul announced that the former south korean president kim dae-jung had cancelled a visit to pyongyang planned for next week .
the trip was now " practically impossible " because of " the unexpected circumstances " , an official said .
mr kim has played a key role in past talks with north korea , and had hoped to use the meeting to help restart stalled six-country talks on ending pyongyang 's nuclear programmes .
north korea has not said it plans to go ahead with a missile launch , but diplomats have asserted the country 's right to develop and test missiles in recent media interviews .
han song-ryol , deputy chief of north korea 's mission to the united nations , told south korea 's yonhap news agency that the country would like to ease tensions over the situation through talks .
talks deadlock north korea last tested a long-range missile in 1998 when it fired a taepodong-1 , with a range of 2,000km -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- , over northern japan .
north korea has observed a self-imposed moratorium since 1999 , but han song-ryol said that this only applied when the country was in dialogue with the us .
the us says north korea also implicitly agreed not to test-launch any new missiles at multi-party talks on its nuclear programme last year .
but the six-party talks have been stalled for months .
correspondents say north korea may be now using the missile threat to try to break the deadlock , or as a bargaining chip in negotiations .

you can tell it 's been a very long trip .
" last night i dreamt i was looking through the viewfinder of my video camera , " bedraggled cameraman jonathon hughes admitted .
" i could see the time code whizzing round in front of my eyes ! "
producer artyom liss was exhausted , too .
he 'd fallen asleep at his laptop computer .
and the bags under my eyes were beginning to look as big as mount elbrus .
but after ten days crossing the caucasus , we 'd finally reached the end of our journey - and what a place to conclude what 's been a fascinating trip .
derbent is 5,000 years old , making it the oldest city not only in dagestan , but in the entire russian federation .
it sits on the west coast of the caspian sea and is dominated by an old fortress built by the sassanids , an ancient iranian empire , some 1,500 years ago .
i stood on the battlements looking out to sea , and pondered what we 'd experienced over the last few days .
in the space of 700 kilometres -lrb- 434 miles -rrb- we 'd seen everything from spa treatments to stalin statues ; we 'd seen pensioners living in bombed-out flats in grozny , and remote communities in the mountains of dagestan .
patchwork of cultures i 'd listened to a string of officials assuring me how calm life is now in the caucasus .
" chechnya 's the safest place in the world , " chechen prime minister ramzan kadyrov had boasted .
you would n't think so , seeing all the checkpoints in grozny and the number of people with guns out on the streets .
" my city 's perfectly calm , " the mayor of makhachkala had told me .
" people relax and enjoy themselves , they go out for walks . "
but coming from a man who 's survived 15 assassination attempts and is paralysed from the waist down , it was n't very convincing .
this has been a journey through one small part of a giant country .
but it feels as if i 've travelled through lots of different countries , each with its own heavily guarded border , its own local language and culture ; and each with its own kind of religious or inter-ethnic tension .
now it was time to fly home .
but our adventures were n't over yet .
from derbent we drove to makhachkala airport to catch the plane back to moscow .
at the airport we were greeted by a policeman who ordered us to take all our boxes and bags into a room to be checked .
each piece of luggage was opened , each object -lrb- apart from dirty socks -rrb- carefully examined .
one security official looked at all the reports i 'd written in my laptop computer ; artyom 's notebook was checked ; he was even asked to translate the first page of a book about the caucasus that was found in my bag .
we were bombarded with questions : where had we gone ?
what had we filmed ?
who had we spoken to ?
it was the most thorough questioning and baggage check i 've ever experienced at a russian airport in 15 years .
it all goes to show that the north caucasus today is n't calm .
russia may have conquered this land 150 years ago , but it 's still struggling here to keep control .
do you have a question for steve rosenberg about his experiences travelling through north caucasus ?
what questions does it raise about the people and politics of this troubled region ?
steve will answer some of your questions here on the bbc news website .
send your questions using the form below .
lermontov often used the caucasus as the setting for his literature , with tales abounding of the wild , romantic , rugged nature of the locals .
how does that conform with reality , and what marks out the people of this region compared with other parts of european russia ?
ps i would be delighted to be considered for any future such trips through hidden parts of russia !
david stephenson , london , uk three questions really .
are the many inter-ethnic divisions primarily gathered around religious , nationalist or racial differences ?
is it possible to characterize them in this bipolar way , and will things get worse before they get better , as the ' war on terror ' begins to take in ever more balkanized religious groups ?
julius beltrame , london uk how safe is the north caucasus for independent tourists ?
ahram al-yardum , philadelphia , pennsylvania , usa what is the amount of economic aid and humanitarian support offered officially to this land ?
there will always be ethnic tension in the region , but could you feel an economic tension one as well -lrb- something which might exacerbate the ethnic strife -rrb- ?
are the people content with their economic situation or do they expect the government to do more ?
anish banerjee , ann arbor , usa do you think that the majority of the chechen people would still like to be independent or would rather stay with russia ?
paul dvali , guildford , uk you do n't show azerbaijan on the map .
but it is an important economic and political actor in the caucasus as a country in the region .
what do people think about neighbours ?
have you felt any attitude of enmity or friendship towards particular neighbours ?
do the people in the region have any chance to integrate into the overall russian society ?
what do you think about the role of islam in the region ?
are you going to visit south caucasus countries as well ?
it would be very interesting for me if you could visit regions of azerbaijan which are under the armenian occupation and to get your impression about the overall climate in these regions of azerbaijan ?
ramil maharramov , washington , dc majority of dagestanis want to stay with russian federation and dagestan is a lot safer now than it was a decade ago .
we would be nothing without it .
i am dagestani and i am proud to be russian too .
gassan , makhachkala , russia -lrb- currently in the usa -rrb- can you describe the cooperation - or lack thereof - between the 30-odd ethnic groups -lrb- and fourteen official ones -rrb- ?
how does the dargin mayor , for example , deal with ethnic tension , or is that problem more in the avar north and peripheral regions ?
your trip and reporting were impressive , inspirational , and it was fun to read along with you !
thank you for choosing the caucasus !
john elliott , washington dc , usa what do the people of the caucasus think about the future for the region and will there ever be any change from the russian influence politically ?
dominic henderson , currently in auckland , new zealand throughout much of the expanse of the russian federation , i have heard from many people identifying themselves as russian before other of the varied sub ethnic groupings .
it seems that the caucuses are one of the only areas in the rf where this is thrown into disarray , is there a visible contention with the ethnic russian population in the region ?
adam cullen , minneapolis , us will chechnya ever regain its independence ?
james wild , london uk how will you predict the situation for dagestan or entire region after 20-25 years ?
still occupied by russians ?

nick bye said he wants to hear first hand why complaints have soared in torquay in recent months .

one pub landlord put yellow signs in his window barring wardens .

he said that despite the huge rise in fines , the council was still making a small loss from parking enforcement after paying setting up costs including a new it system and extra staff .

journey 's end : the team relaxing by the caspian sea you can tell it 's been a very long trip .
" last night i dreamt i was looking through the viewfinder of my video camera , " bedraggled cameraman jonathon hughes admitted .
" i could see the time code whizzing round in front of my eyes ! "
producer artyom liss was exhausted , too .
he 'd fallen asleep at his laptop computer .
and the bags under my eyes were beginning to look as big as mount elbrus .
but after ten days crossing the caucasus , we 'd finally reached the end of our journey - and what a place to conclude what 's been a fascinating trip .
derbent is 5,000 years old , making it the oldest city not only in dagestan , but in the entire russian federation .
it sits on the west coast of the caspian sea and is dominated by an old fortress built by the sassanids , an ancient iranian empire , some 1,500 years ago .
i stood on the battlements looking out to sea , and pondered what we 'd experienced over the last few days .
click here to see a map of the region in the space of 700 kilometres -lrb- 434 miles -rrb- we 'd seen everything from spa treatments to stalin statues ; we 'd seen pensioners living in bombed-out flats in grozny , and remote communities in the mountains of dagestan .
patchwork of cultures i 'd listened to a string of officials assuring me how calm life is now in the caucasus .
the sassanid-era fortress , used for centuries , dominates derbent " chechnya 's the safest place in the world , " chechen prime minister ramzan kadyrov had boasted .
you would n't think so , seeing all the checkpoints in grozny and the number of people with guns out on the streets .
" my city 's perfectly calm , " the mayor of makhachkala had told me .
" people relax and enjoy themselves , they go out for walks . "
but coming from a man who 's survived 15 assassination attempts and is paralysed from the waist down , it was n't very convincing .
this has been a journey through one small part of a giant country .
but it feels as if i 've travelled through lots of different countries , each with its own heavily guarded border , its own local language and culture ; and each with its own kind of religious or inter-ethnic tension .
send us your questions for steve rosenberg now it was time to fly home .
but our adventures were n't over yet .
from derbent we drove to makhachkala airport to catch the plane back to moscow .
at the airport we were greeted by a policeman who ordered us to take all our boxes and bags into a room to be checked .
each piece of luggage was opened , each object -lrb- apart from dirty socks -rrb- carefully examined .
one security official looked at all the reports i 'd written in my laptop computer ; artyom 's notebook was checked ; he was even asked to translate the first page of a book about the caucasus that was found in my bag .
we were bombarded with questions : where had we gone ?
what had we filmed ?
who had we spoken to ?
it was the most thorough questioning and baggage check i 've ever experienced at a russian airport in 15 years .
it all goes to show that the north caucasus today is n't calm .
russia may have conquered this land 150 years ago , but it 's still struggling here to keep control .
click to return do you have a question for steve rosenberg about his experiences travelling through north caucasus ?
what questions does it raise about the people and politics of this troubled region ?
steve will answer some of your questions here on the bbc news website .
send your questions using the form below .
lermontov often used the caucasus as the setting for his literature , with tales abounding of the wild , romantic , rugged nature of the locals .
how does that conform with reality , and what marks out the people of this region compared with other parts of european russia ?
ps i would be delighted to be considered for any future such trips through hidden parts of russia !
david stephenson , london , uk three questions really .
are the many inter-ethnic divisions primarily gathered around religious , nationalist or racial differences ?
is it possible to characterize them in this bipolar way , and will things get worse before they get better , as the ' war on terror ' begins to take in ever more balkanized religious groups ?
julius beltrame , london uk how safe is the north caucasus for independent tourists ?
ahram al-yardum , philadelphia , pennsylvania , usa what is the amount of economic aid and humanitarian support offered officially to this land ?
there will always be ethnic tension in the region , but could you feel an economic tension one as well -lrb- something which might exacerbate the ethnic strife -rrb- ?
are the people content with their economic situation or do they expect the government to do more ?
anish banerjee , ann arbor , usa do you think that the majority of the chechen people would still like to be independent or would rather stay with russia ?
paul dvali , guildford , uk you do n't show azerbaijan on the map .
but it is an important economic and political actor in the caucasus as a country in the region .
what do people think about neighbours ?
have you felt any attitude of enmity or friendship towards particular neighbours ?
do the people in the region have any chance to integrate into the overall russian society ?
what do you think about the role of islam in the region ?
are you going to visit south caucasus countries as well ?
it would be very interesting for me if you could visit regions of azerbaijan which are under the armenian occupation and to get your impression about the overall climate in these regions of azerbaijan ?
ramil maharramov , washington , dc majority of dagestanis want to stay with russian federation and dagestan is a lot safer now than it was a decade ago .
we would be nothing without it .
i am dagestani and i am proud to be russian too .
gassan , makhachkala , russia -lrb- currently in the usa -rrb- can you describe the cooperation - or lack thereof - between the 30-odd ethnic groups -lrb- and fourteen official ones -rrb- ?
how does the dargin mayor , for example , deal with ethnic tension , or is that problem more in the avar north and peripheral regions ?
your trip and reporting were impressive , inspirational , and it was fun to read along with you !
thank you for choosing the caucasus !
john elliott , washington dc , usa what do the people of the caucasus think about the future for the region and will there ever be any change from the russian influence politically ?
dominic henderson , currently in auckland , new zealand throughout much of the expanse of the russian federation , i have heard from many people identifying themselves as russian before other of the varied sub ethnic groupings .
it seems that the caucuses are one of the only areas in the rf where this is thrown into disarray , is there a visible contention with the ethnic russian population in the region ?
adam cullen , minneapolis , us will chechnya ever regain its independence ?
james wild , london uk how will you predict the situation for dagestan or entire region after 20-25 years ?
still occupied by russians ?

patchwork of cultures i 'd listened to a string of officials assuring me how calm life is now in the caucasus .
the sassanid-era fortress , used for centuries , dominates derbent " chechnya 's the safest place in the world , " chechen prime minister ramzan kadyrov had boasted .
you would n't think so , seeing all the checkpoints in grozny and the number of people with guns out on the streets .
" my city 's perfectly calm , " the mayor of makhachkala had told me .
" people relax and enjoy themselves , they go out for walks . "
but coming from a man who 's survived 15 assassination attempts and is paralysed from the waist down , it was n't very convincing .
this has been a journey through one small part of a giant country .
but it feels as if i 've travelled through lots of different countries , each with its own heavily guarded border , its own local language and culture ; and each with its own kind of religious or inter-ethnic tension .
send us your questions for steve rosenberg now it was time to fly home .
but our adventures were n't over yet .
from derbent we drove to makhachkala airport to catch the plane back to moscow .
at the airport we were greeted by a policeman who ordered us to take all our boxes and bags into a room to be checked .
each piece of luggage was opened , each object -lrb- apart from dirty socks -rrb- carefully examined .
one security official looked at all the reports i 'd written in my laptop computer ; artyom 's notebook was checked ; he was even asked to translate the first page of a book about the caucasus that was found in my bag .
we were bombarded with questions : where had we gone ?
what had we filmed ?
who had we spoken to ?
it was the most thorough questioning and baggage check i 've ever experienced at a russian airport in 15 years .
it all goes to show that the north caucasus today is n't calm .
russia may have conquered this land 150 years ago , but it 's still struggling here to keep control .

journey 's end : the team relaxing by the caspian sea you can tell it 's been a very long trip .
" last night i dreamt i was looking through the viewfinder of my video camera , " bedraggled cameraman jonathon hughes admitted .
" i could see the time code whizzing round in front of my eyes ! "
producer artyom liss was exhausted , too .
he 'd fallen asleep at his laptop computer .
and the bags under my eyes were beginning to look as big as mount elbrus .
but after ten days crossing the caucasus , we 'd finally reached the end of our journey - and what a place to conclude what 's been a fascinating trip .
derbent is 5,000 years old , making it the oldest city not only in dagestan , but in the entire russian federation .
it sits on the west coast of the caspian sea and is dominated by an old fortress built by the sassanids , an ancient iranian empire , some 1,500 years ago .
i stood on the battlements looking out to sea , and pondered what we 'd experienced over the last few days .
click here to see a map of the region in the space of 700 kilometres -lrb- 434 miles -rrb- we 'd seen everything from spa treatments to stalin statues ; we 'd seen pensioners living in bombed-out flats in grozny , and remote communities in the mountains of dagestan .
patchwork of cultures i 'd listened to a string of officials assuring me how calm life is now in the caucasus .
the sassanid-era fortress , used for centuries , dominates derbent " chechnya 's the safest place in the world , " chechen prime minister ramzan kadyrov had boasted .
you would n't think so , seeing all the checkpoints in grozny and the number of people with guns out on the streets .
" my city 's perfectly calm , " the mayor of makhachkala had told me .
" people relax and enjoy themselves , they go out for walks . "
but coming from a man who 's survived 15 assassination attempts and is paralysed from the waist down , it was n't very convincing .
this has been a journey through one small part of a giant country .
but it feels as if i 've travelled through lots of different countries , each with its own heavily guarded border , its own local language and culture ; and each with its own kind of religious or inter-ethnic tension .
send us your questions for steve rosenberg now it was time to fly home .
but our adventures were n't over yet .
from derbent we drove to makhachkala airport to catch the plane back to moscow .
at the airport we were greeted by a policeman who ordered us to take all our boxes and bags into a room to be checked .
each piece of luggage was opened , each object -lrb- apart from dirty socks -rrb- carefully examined .
one security official looked at all the reports i 'd written in my laptop computer ; artyom 's notebook was checked ; he was even asked to translate the first page of a book about the caucasus that was found in my bag .
we were bombarded with questions : where had we gone ?
what had we filmed ?
who had we spoken to ?
it was the most thorough questioning and baggage check i 've ever experienced at a russian airport in 15 years .
it all goes to show that the north caucasus today is n't calm .
russia may have conquered this land 150 years ago , but it 's still struggling here to keep control .

nick bye said he wants to hear first hand why complaints have soared in torquay in recent months .
parking fines rose six fold , from 4,581 in 2004 to 28,500 last year - about 80 a day - after national parking firm ncp took over duties in torbay .
one pub landlord put yellow signs in his window barring wardens .
and gift shops are selling t shirts with a seagull and a parking attendant and the question : " which one will s * * * on you first ? "
but mr bye said complaints had " got out of hand " . "
they are simply doing their job " nick bye he said : " it is wrong to always blame the attendants for issuing the fixed penalty notices .
they are simply doing their job .
" however , it is important that we as a council listen to the people we serve , and there have certainly been some important issues that have been raised since we took on the enforcement role . "
he said that despite the huge rise in fines , the council was still making a small loss from parking enforcement after paying setting up costs including a new it system and extra staff .
the council pays £ 543,000 a year to ncp and is expecting to break even in four years ' time .
tim cowen , of ncp , said : " we get a fee from keeping the traffic flowing .
it 's not based on ticket numbers . "
torbay council , responding to complaints , has introduced a " waiver " on double yellow lines for removal vans , scaffold lorries or vehicles where constant access to tools or materials is required .

a number of people in the west clare seaside town of kilkee are concerned a memorial to one of ireland 's most celebrated actors might draw a " rough element " to the wellington square area .
harris attracted younger fans for his role in harry potter manuel di lucia , the project director behind the richard harris memorial committee , said he was determined to erect a statue in kilkee to mark the place where the oscar-nominated actor spent many holidays .
" the objection is that it will bring a rowdy element to the area , " said mr di lucia .
" i ca n't comprehend this piece of objection , i ca n't understand that .
phil lynott was probably one of the biggest rock guys in ireland .
they have a statue of him in dublin .
" how many people are standing around his statue at night causing problems ? "
" the objections are completely unfounded because this is an area which is totally residential . "
harris , who starred in the field and in more recent years as the wily head of hogwarts school in harry potter and the sorcerer 's stone , died in october 2002 at the age of 72 .
he had just finished work on the second harry potter movie , chamber of secrets , when he became ill .
we have the statue being made - it will go up in kilkee somewhere , i can guarantee you that manuel di lucia friend mr di lucia , a cousin of hollywood actor danny devito , said limerick-born harris 's ties to the area began when he spent holidays there with his brothers during his youth .
" everytime he came to kilkee he brought an air of joviality to the town , " he said .
" he was very flamboyant , very well liked by everybody . "
the statue , which is being designed by seamus connolly , will show harris playing racquet ball - a game at which he excelled , winning a competition four years in a row at the town .
mr di lucia who raised more than half of the required 40,000 euro funding in donations from harris 's three sons , said the statue in honour of harris would definitely go ahead .
" we have the statue being made .
it will go up in kilkee somewhere , i can guarantee you that , " he said .
harris built his reputation on his commanding performances in films such as a man called horse and this sporting life .
he was twice nominated for oscars for this sporting life and the field and was also nominated for a british independent film award for his performance as the leader of a liverpool crime syndicate in my kingdom .
however , he was also renowned for his hellraiser lifestyle and heavy drinking .
he admitted his wayward nature almost lost him the role of harry potter 's wise old wizard headmaster .
the statue in his memory is due to be unveiled on 30 september .

a number of people in the west clare seaside town of kilkee are concerned a memorial to one of ireland 's most celebrated actors might draw a " rough element " to the wellington square area .
harris attracted younger fans for his role in harry potter manuel di lucia , the project director behind the richard harris memorial committee , said he was determined to erect a statue in kilkee to mark the place where the oscar-nominated actor spent many holidays .

a number of people in the west clare seaside town of kilkee are concerned a memorial to one of ireland 's most celebrated actors might draw a " rough element " to the wellington square area .
manuel di lucia , the project director behind the richard harris memorial committee , said he was determined to erect a statue in kilkee to mark the place where the oscar-nominated actor spent many holidays .
" the objection is that it will bring a rowdy element to the area , " said mr di lucia .
" i ca n't comprehend this piece of objection , i ca n't understand that .
phil lynott was probably one of the biggest rock guys in ireland .
they have a statue of him in dublin .
" how many people are standing around his statue at night causing problems ? "
" the objections are completely unfounded because this is an area which is totally residential . "
harris , who starred in the field and in more recent years as the wily head of hogwarts school in harry potter and the sorcerer 's stone , died in october 2002 at the age of 72 .
he had just finished work on the second harry potter movie , chamber of secrets , when he became ill . "
we have the statue being made - it will go up in kilkee somewhere , i can guarantee you that " manuel di lucia friend mr di lucia , a cousin of hollywood actor danny devito , said limerick-born harris 's ties to the area began when he spent holidays there with his brothers during his youth .
" everytime he came to kilkee he brought an air of joviality to the town , " he said .
" he was very flamboyant , very well liked by everybody . "
the statue , which is being designed by seamus connolly , will show harris playing racquet ball - a game at which he excelled , winning a competition four years in a row at the town .
mr di lucia who raised more than half of the required 40,000 euro funding in donations from harris 's three sons , said the statue in honour of harris would definitely go ahead .
" we have the statue being made .
it will go up in kilkee somewhere , i can guarantee you that , " he said .
harris built his reputation on his commanding performances in films such as a man called horse and this sporting life .
he was twice nominated for oscars for this sporting life and the field and was also nominated for a british independent film award for his performance as the leader of a liverpool crime syndicate in my kingdom .
however , he was also renowned for his hellraiser lifestyle and heavy drinking .
he admitted his wayward nature almost lost him the role of harry potter 's wise old wizard headmaster .
the statue in his memory is due to be unveiled on 30 september .

last month law lords ruled that compensation to sufferers should be cut if responsibility could not be attached to a single employer .
the lord chancellor intends to amend the ruling in england and wales .
the scottish executive is expected to announce plans for a sewel motion or its own law on thursday .
the asbestos-related disease , mesothelioma , is an incurable cancer affecting the lining of the lungs .
it kills about 1,900 people every year , and it is thought about 2,000 clyde shipyard workers could have the condition .
we must put maximum pressure on the scottish msps and the scottish executive to bring this in very quickly because people are dying of mesothelioma right now frank mcguire thompsons solicitors lawyer frank mcguire , who represents asbestos victims in scotland , said he was positive that the executive would act , following the lord chancellor 's statement .
" i have every confidence they will because des mcnulty msp had a motion condemning the judgement and an overwhelming number of msps agreed with him , " he said .
" it 's putting back the law where it was before the judgement . "
mr mcguire said a holyrood member 's bill , proposed by labour msp des mcnulty , aimed to close another loophole related to asbestos-related disease compensation .
he said as things stood sufferers and their families faced an " appalling dilemma " .
they can opt to take their compensation while they are still alive , or leave it until after their death when their families might be able to claim a larger sum , he said .
mr mcguire said deputy justice minister hugh henry had sympathy for their cause and had pledged to either back the member 's bill or bring in an executive bill .
he added : " we must put maximum pressure on the scottish msps and the scottish executive to bring this in very quickly because people are dying of mesothelioma right now . "
cross-party support mr mcnulty said he was hopeful the cause would get executive backing .
" i 've had tremendous support from my own party and from other parties within the scottish parliament in taking this forward , " he said .
" i think people really believe this is a moral issue .
" we really must do the right thing by these people and i think the scottish parliament will do so and i 'm hopeful that the scottish executive will facilitate that . "

last month law lords ruled that compensation to sufferers should be cut if responsibility could not be attached to a single employer .
the lord chancellor intends to amend the ruling in england and wales .
the scottish executive is expected to announce plans for a sewel motion or its own law on thursday .
the asbestos-related disease , mesothelioma , is an incurable cancer affecting the lining of the lungs .
it kills about 1,900 people every year , and it is thought about 2,000 clyde shipyard workers could have the condition .
we must put maximum pressure on the scottish msps and the scottish executive to bring this in very quickly because people are dying of mesothelioma right now frank mcguire thompsons solicitors lawyer frank mcguire , who represents asbestos victims in scotland , said he was positive that the executive would act , following the lord chancellor 's statement .
" i have every confidence they will because des mcnulty msp had a motion condemning the judgement and an overwhelming number of msps agreed with him , " he said .
" it 's putting back the law where it was before the judgement . "
mr mcguire said a holyrood member 's bill , proposed by labour msp des mcnulty , aimed to close another loophole related to asbestos-related disease compensation .
he said as things stood sufferers and their families faced an " appalling dilemma " .
they can opt to take their compensation while they are still alive , or leave it until after their death when their families might be able to claim a larger sum , he said .
mr mcguire said deputy justice minister hugh henry had sympathy for their cause and had pledged to either back the member 's bill or bring in an executive bill .
he added : " we must put maximum pressure on the scottish msps and the scottish executive to bring this in very quickly because people are dying of mesothelioma right now . "
cross-party support mr mcnulty said he was hopeful the cause would get executive backing .
" i 've had tremendous support from my own party and from other parties within the scottish parliament in taking this forward , " he said .
" i think people really believe this is a moral issue .
" we really must do the right thing by these people and i think the scottish parliament will do so and i 'm hopeful that the scottish executive will facilitate that . "

q & a : high-definition tv i think i might be starting to fall out of love with high definition -lrb- hd -rrb- .
do n't get me wrong , i 'm still very impressed , but that misty eyed infatuation has gone .
and i can tell you the exact moment when it happened .
it was 14.03 pm on saturday 10 june , during england 's opening match with paraguay .
beckham was poised to take a vital free kick .
as the rest of the team jostled in the penalty area , i suddenly heard a loud roar from the pub down the road .
for a split second i was puzzled , but then realised these were england fans celebrating a goal , which according to my set had yet to be scored .
sure enough , i looked back at my hd set and saw beckham 's kick soar into the back of the net .
the truth dawned , the hd picture was delayed by a second or so .
that may not seem much , but it is enough to spoil your enjoyment of a match .
a roar from the pub serves advance notice of what i was about to see on my set .
shut your windows in the case of a penalty shoot-out , the delay would ruin the drama completely .
a bbc spokeswoman admitted this was a problem .
hdtv in europe commercial hdtv services began with belgian channel euro180 in 2004 telewest launched the uk 's first hdtv service in march 2006 .
bbc and sky began hdtv transmissions in may 2006 bbc to have 100 % hd programmes by 2010 martin shankleman on the mesmerising lure of hdtv " it is something we 're aware of , yes " , she said , and helpfully suggested the most practical answer might be to shut the windows .
she explained the problem was caused by the complexity of handling the extra information .
" any digital signal requires processing time at the capture stage , coding and again when it hits your set-top box .
" this inevitably leads to a slight time lapse .
normally this does n't matter very much , unless it 's a live event as you 've found , " she said .
if this delay was a big disappointment , so too was the lack of authentic hd programmes , even on the dedicated channels .
nothing on i first realised this while watching test cricket from the west indies .
even though this was shown on sky sports hd , the picture quality lacked the tell-tale clarity .
a sky spokeswoman confirmed my suspicion that i had been watching a conventional broadcast relayed on the hd channel .
" not all programming on all high-definition channels is actually hd , " she said .
a quick survey confirmed a real dearth of authentic hd programming on the dedicated channels .
not a single programme on sky one hd in the schedules for the evening of 20 june had been shot in hd .
the same went for the evening schedules for sky sports hd for 19 june .
sky admitted that their only hd channels with guaranteed 100 % hd content were the film channels .
none of these criticisms detract from the amazing quality this new technology delivers to viewers .
but customers should beware of the pitfalls before making what could be an expensive investment .

q & a : high-definition tv i think i might be starting to fall out of love with high definition -lrb- hd -rrb- .
do n't get me wrong , i 'm still very impressed , but that misty eyed infatuation has gone .
and i can tell you the exact moment when it happened .
it was 14.03 pm on saturday 10 june , during england 's opening match with paraguay .
beckham was poised to take a vital free kick .
as the rest of the team jostled in the penalty area , i suddenly heard a loud roar from the pub down the road .
for a split second i was puzzled , but then realised these were england fans celebrating a goal , which according to my set had yet to be scored .
sure enough , i looked back at my hd set and saw beckham 's kick soar into the back of the net .
the truth dawned , the hd picture was delayed by a second or so .
that may not seem much , but it is enough to spoil your enjoyment of a match .
a roar from the pub serves advance notice of what i was about to see on my set .
shut your windows in the case of a penalty shoot-out , the delay would ruin the drama completely .
a bbc spokeswoman admitted this was a problem .
hdtv in europe commercial hdtv services began with belgian channel euro180 in 2004 telewest launched the uk 's first hdtv service in march 2006 .
bbc and sky began hdtv transmissions in may 2006 bbc to have 100 % hd programmes by 2010 martin shankleman on the mesmerising lure of hdtv " it is something we 're aware of , yes " , she said , and helpfully suggested the most practical answer might be to shut the windows .
she explained the problem was caused by the complexity of handling the extra information .
" any digital signal requires processing time at the capture stage , coding and again when it hits your set-top box .
" this inevitably leads to a slight time lapse .
normally this does n't matter very much , unless it 's a live event as you 've found , " she said .
if this delay was a big disappointment , so too was the lack of authentic hd programmes , even on the dedicated channels .
nothing on i first realised this while watching test cricket from the west indies .
even though this was shown on sky sports hd , the picture quality lacked the tell-tale clarity .
a sky spokeswoman confirmed my suspicion that i had been watching a conventional broadcast relayed on the hd channel .
" not all programming on all high-definition channels is actually hd , " she said .
a quick survey confirmed a real dearth of authentic hd programming on the dedicated channels .
not a single programme on sky one hd in the schedules for the evening of 20 june had been shot in hd .
the same went for the evening schedules for sky sports hd for 19 june .
sky admitted that their only hd channels with guaranteed 100 % hd content were the film channels .
none of these criticisms detract from the amazing quality this new technology delivers to viewers .
but customers should beware of the pitfalls before making what could be an expensive investment .

do n't get me wrong , i 'm still very impressed , but that misty eyed infatuation has gone .
and i can tell you the exact moment when it happened .
it was 14.03 pm on saturday 10 june , during england 's opening match with paraguay .
beckham was poised to take a vital free kick .
as the rest of the team jostled in the penalty area , i suddenly heard a loud roar from the pub down the road .
for a split second i was puzzled , but then realised these were england fans celebrating a goal , which according to my set had yet to be scored .
sure enough , i looked back at my hd set and saw beckham 's kick soar into the back of the net .
the truth dawned , the hd picture was delayed by a second or so .
that may not seem much , but it is enough to spoil your enjoyment of a match .

she explained the problem was caused by the complexity of handling the extra information .

" this inevitably leads to a slight time lapse .
normally this does n't matter very much , unless it 's a live event as you 've found , " she said .
if this delay was a big disappointment , so too was the lack of authentic hd programmes , even on the dedicated channels .
nothing on i first realised this while watching test cricket from the west indies .
even though this was shown on sky sports hd , the picture quality lacked the tell-tale clarity .
a sky spokeswoman confirmed my suspicion that i had been watching a conventional broadcast relayed on the hd channel .
" not all programming on all high-definition channels is actually hd , " she said .
a quick survey confirmed a real dearth of authentic hd programming on the dedicated channels .
not a single programme on sky one hd in the schedules for the evening of 20 june had been shot in hd .

in the first of three reports , the bbc 's jill mcgivering spent three days travelling with maoist fighters in the jungles of the central state of chhattisgarh to find out why they have taken up arms .
we travelled by jeep in pitch darkness for about 10 hours through the jungle , led by a succession of different guides .
finally , we stopped and were led to a small clearing .
most of the maoist fighters are young , many in their teens a flickering torch lit up the faces of about 30 or 40 young fighters , standing in line shoulder to shoulder , most dressed in military fatigues , all carrying guns .
most of them seemed very young , certainly still in their teens .
some wore military boots , others wore flip-flops , some were simply barefoot .
each one shook my hand , then raised their fist in a clenched salute with the words : lal salaam !
which means : red salute !
that night the monsoon rains broke .
we were lying on the jungle floor on simple plastic groundsheets .
as the rain grew heavier , the maoists hastily marched us to a nearby house , several one room mud-brick huts set round a mud yard .
we lay on the floor of one of these with the chickens .
red corridor the next day started at 0500 with roll call .
then we watched about 20 members of the platoon as they were put through their paces by a commander - first exercise , then military drill .
people are hungry , they have no jobs - that 's why people are coming to this fight rebel commander gopanna markam they practised firing positions , standing , sitting and crouching and crawling on their stomachs through the undergrowth .
their guns were a mixture .
most had wooden shafts and long single barrels .
they had made some of them themselves in the camp , they said .
others were the same old-fashioned enfield rifles still used widely by the indian police , taken perhaps during a raid on a police post .
maoist militants , known here as naxalites , have been fighting in india since the late 1960s .
until recently , they have basically been in pockets in the jungles in india 's poorest states .
every morning the fighters undergo rigorous training more recently there has been more unity between these groups .
analysts talk now about the emergence of the red corridor , a great swathe of maoist militancy which stretches all the way from the border with nepal , south through india to the sea .
later i was introduced to a senior maoist commander , gopanna markam , a veteran of 25 years with the guerrilla force .
i asked him how he would describe what he was fighting for .
" we 're fighting for a new democratic revolution in this country , " he said .
" people are hungry , there 's nothing to eat .
they have no clothes .
they have no jobs .
we want development for the people .
that 's why people are coming to this fight . "
successful ' revolutions ' i asked him about the maoist groups in nepal who may lay down their arms and join the democratic process .
people who create trouble for poor people , they should be dealt with maoist fighter jaymati at first he was cautious .
the official response was still being determined by the leadership , he said , who would issue a statement in due course .
but events in nepal were being watched closely , he said - adding that the changes there were giving them hope .
" we hope that revolution is successful , " he said , " so that will be an example all over the world because there is a big propaganda that socialism is finished .
but nepal we 're hoping will show the way . "
the language used by the commander to talk about his ideology , and the maoist ambition of capturing the country 's cities and overthrowing the indian state , was littered with mao 's phrases and terms , an echo from 40 years ago .
the maoist insurgency in india began in the late 1960s attempts since then to discredit some of mao 's thinking or challenge his ideas were , the commander told me , just a result of revisionism .
mao 's theory is universal , he said .
the chinese revolution was a success .
later , i sat with a more junior member of the platoon , a 26-year-old woman called jaymati who joined the maoists eight years ago .
her face was stern as she described why she had left her family for this nomadic life as a jungle guerrilla .
she had grown up seeing the fight for the poor going on around her , she told me , so she thought she should join it .
even if she wanted change in her society , i asked , did n't she think there was a way of achieving that peacefully , without killing and violence ?
she seemed impassive .
" there 's a lot of exploitation of poor people , " she said , " and the only way is to make them powerful , to make them the ruler .
people who create trouble for poor people , they should be dealt with .
they should be finished .
they should be eliminated . "
certainly violence in chhattisgarh is steadily escalating .
the number of people killed there , according to government figures , has doubled each year in the last few years .
most of the dead are civilians .

analysts talk now about the emergence of the red corridor , a great swathe of maoist militancy which stretches all the way from the border with nepal , south through india to the sea .
later i was introduced to a senior maoist commander , gopanna markam , a veteran of 25 years with the guerrilla force .
i asked him how he would describe what he was fighting for .
" we 're fighting for a new democratic revolution in this country , " he said .
" people are hungry , there 's nothing to eat .
they have no clothes .
they have no jobs .
we want development for the people .
that 's why people are coming to this fight . "
successful ' revolutions ' i asked him about the maoist groups in nepal who may lay down their arms and join the democratic process . "
people who create trouble for poor people , they should be dealt with " maoist fighter jaymati at first he was cautious .
the official response was still being determined by the leadership , he said , who would issue a statement in due course .
but events in nepal were being watched closely , he said - adding that the changes there were giving them hope .
" we hope that revolution is successful , " he said , " so that will be an example all over the world because there is a big propaganda that socialism is finished .
but nepal we 're hoping will show the way . "
the language used by the commander to talk about his ideology , and the maoist ambition of capturing the country 's cities and overthrowing the indian state , was littered with mao 's phrases and terms , an echo from 40 years ago .
attempts since then to discredit some of mao 's thinking or challenge his ideas were , the commander told me , just a result of revisionism .
mao 's theory is universal , he said .
the chinese revolution was a success .
later , i sat with a more junior member of the platoon , a 26-year-old woman called jaymati who joined the maoists eight years ago .
her face was stern as she described why she had left her family for this nomadic life as a jungle guerrilla .
she had grown up seeing the fight for the poor going on around her , she told me , so she thought she should join it .
even if she wanted change in her society , i asked , did n't she think there was a way of achieving that peacefully , without killing and violence ?
she seemed impassive .
" there 's a lot of exploitation of poor people , " she said , " and the only way is to make them powerful , to make them the ruler .
people who create trouble for poor people , they should be dealt with .
they should be finished .
they should be eliminated . "
certainly violence in chhattisgarh is steadily escalating .
the number of people killed there , according to government figures , has doubled each year in the last few years .
most of the dead are civilians .
