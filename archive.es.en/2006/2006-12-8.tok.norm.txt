for example , the federal government can not regulate the smoker 's right to light up in local or state government offices , according to rupert scholz , a constitutional lawyer in berlin . ban withdrawal draws critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal banned smoking in most restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars the rejection of the coalition government 's original proposal , drew criticism from politicians who support a smoking ban . " what we are witnessing is the government bending to the tobacco lobby , " said social democratic parliamentarian and health expert karl lauterbach in the newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" how can it be that in the rest of europe , the rights of non-smokers are protected , but our government says that it is not possible in germany ? " carola reimann , a social democratic spokeswoman on health issues , insisted that it was legally possible to enforce a federal ban . " we can and should go ahead with the planned proposal , " she told the daily braunschweiger zeitung . but even that met with criticism , as some politicians said the original proposal did not go far enough in protecting non-smokers . " at first the ruling parties make the illogical rule that smoking would be banned in restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars , " said bärbel höhn , the opposition green party 's deputy leader .
" now they bring up constitutional obstacles .
smoking should be banned in all gastronomical establishments .
period . " complex constitutional issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's largest tobacco market next week the federal cabinet , with input from the justice and interior ministries , will issue a paper outlining the terms that the states would be required to follow , a government spokesman said thursday evening . " a comprehensive smoking ban can not be put in place without cooperation from the states , " the spokesman added .
" the constitutional issues are highly complex .
we want a constitutionally sound law that protects non-smokers in germany . " chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet , however , can prohibit tobacco consumption in federal agencies and ministries , according to the newspaper handelsblatt .
but it will be up to the individual states to ban smoking in schools , hospitals , public transport , restaurants and elsewhere . germany out of step with other european states germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
several surveys recent have also shown that the majority of germans favor prohibiting smoking , but politicians remain deeply divided over a comprehensive ban . france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with its european counterparts . a further obstacle is that many germans perceive the right to light up as a cherished personal freedom and that some see the anti-smoking lobby as having been historically tainted by the nazi hostility to smoking . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on smoking ban details germany is to ban smoking in public buildings and most restaurants , after a compromise was reached friday between the country 's two ruling parties .

three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .

the eu is wondering if the move is n't just a way to avert partial suspension of membership talks . " we 've told the europeans clearly that this is not up for discussion , " cypriot foreign minister george lillikas told reporters . turkey said it is ready to open one seaport and one airport to cyprus for one year to salvage its eu accession talks , but it expects a solution to the three-decade division of the island during that period . " turkey started accession talks with the european union under the condition they would realize the -lrb- customs -rrb- protocol one year later .
they have not done this , " lillikas said .
" this is a pre-planned move by turkey to make an impression and one that we expected .
this makes a mockery of the european union as it is devoid of any serious content . " the eu has been threatening to suspend turkey 's accession talks , started in oct .
2005 , over its failure to open its harbors and ports to craft from cyprus , whose government ankara does not recognize . cautious optimism european union officials voiced cautious optimism on thursday that a last-minute turkish offer may save ankara 's troubled bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier sees positive elements in the turkish proposal finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency , said turkey 's initiative was " a positive step " but warned that the eu still needed more details . " if turkey is ready for such an unconditional move , this positive step will influence ... discussions on the continuation of turkey 's eu accession process , " tumioja said . the european commission - the eu 's executive body - also described the surprise turkish initiative as a " significant move " which needed further scrutiny . " i hope that we will soon have clarification on the exact nature of this step by the turkish government , " commission president jose manuel barroso said .
" if it is confirmed , it is obviously a very important step in the direction of complete implementation of the ankara protocol .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .
6 , " it read .
" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .
" police and prosecutors will do everything in their power to investigate these people , " he said .
" anyone who claims they intend to perpetrate violence is punishable . " chaos ensues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are fielding threatening calls but helmut rau 's decision to go public with the warning met with widespread criticism .
no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .
" it could add up to a figure it will take a lifetime to pay off , " he said .
but the regional government insisted it had acted correctly .
" there could be nothing worse for the people affected than to be kept in the dark and overwhelmed by rumors , " said baden-württemberg 's interior minister , heribert rech .
" anyone with the slightest suspicion a killing spree might take place should not be afraid to come forward , " agreed his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia , ingo wolf .
" at stake is the safety of students , teachers and the culprit themselves . " media panic-mongering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear teenagers are being corrupted by computer games inevitably , the threats have hit germany 's headlines .
but many are wondering if the media interest does not in fact serve to spur on disaffected young people rather than to deter them . " some people use the media interest to draw attention to themselves , " federal police union president wolfgang speck told the daily die welt . micha hilgers , a psychoanalyst based in aachen , agreed .
" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them . " the surfeit of intimate details encourages teenagers to identify with the culprit , " he said .
" they think : he was as old as me , he goes to the same sort of school i do - all i need now is my grandfather 's firearm .

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .
6 , " it read .
" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .
" police and prosecutors will do everything in their power to investigate these people , " he said .
" anyone who claims they intend to perpetrate violence is punishable . " chaos ensues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are fielding threatening calls but helmut rau 's decision to go public with the warning met with widespread criticism .
no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .
" it could add up to a figure it will take a lifetime to pay off , " he said .
but the regional government insisted it had acted correctly .
" there could be nothing worse for the people affected than to be kept in the dark and overwhelmed by rumors , " said baden-württemberg 's interior minister , heribert rech .
" anyone with the slightest suspicion a killing spree might take place should not be afraid to come forward , " agreed his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia , ingo wolf .
" at stake is the safety of students , teachers and the culprit themselves . " media panic-mongering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear teenagers are being corrupted by computer games inevitably , the threats have hit germany 's headlines .
but many are wondering if the media interest does not in fact serve to spur on disaffected young people rather than to deter them . " some people use the media interest to draw attention to themselves , " federal police union president wolfgang speck told the daily die welt . micha hilgers , a psychoanalyst based in aachen , agreed .
" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them . " the surfeit of intimate details encourages teenagers to identify with the culprit , " he said .

he spoke to dw-radio editor-in-chief miodrag soric about the challenges germany and the world are facing today . mr. president , you 've spent many years of your life abroad .
you also know germany from an external perspective .
how is germany perceived abroad ?
is this picture changing ? my impression is that it 's getting better .
the period immediately after wwii was marked by the nazi 's crimes and the discussion about guilt .

all this shows , i believe , that we can be proud of our country .
on the other hand , we should know that other responsibilities lie ahead of us , and that we ca n't run away from the duties that the international community must perform . you recently spoke about ethically-based journalism being able to contribute to cultural and religious understanding in the world .

people out there are clever and critical .
you ca n't fool them .

the free press , so to speak , is the staple of democracy .
the free press must be responsible and that also means ethically and morally responsible .
in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .
i have also seen - in my political activities as well as in my private and social life - that africa is often talked about , but also that many people believe it is essentially a lost continent .
if we allow this kind of thinking to get embedded in people 's heads , we would be unfair to the efforts being pursued and the progress being made in africa .
at the same time , we would also hurt ourselves because we would be teaching our young people that there is a discrepancy between our slogans , our ethic and moral vocabulary and our political intentions , on the one hand , and the reality , on the other . deutsche welle wants to expand its presence in islamic countries .

there are big problems in the middle eastern and arab countries .
there is no doubt that peace in the middle east is possible .
but a fundamental prerequisite for this is that we learn more about each other .
we know too little about the arab world , and the arab world knows too little about us .
i think , for example , that good integration of our muslim citizens is also part of a trust-building concept .
if our muslim citizens become well-integrated , if we take them in with open arms , it will also show the arab world that we have nothing against muslims .
on that basis , we could then discuss what 's important in terms of foreign policy or the fight against terrorism . over the past few months , you have voiced your opinion about several politically divisive topics .
you are thought of as a very political president .
what can we expect from the second half of your term in office ? i do n't have a policy of intervention because i am not busy enough or because i am too impatient .
i simply think that the president should contribute to the process of finding solutions for the country 's fundamental problems .
and i think that our fundamental problems are unemployment , education and integration .
if we address politically these three areas in a decisive , urgent , steady and straightforward manner , our country will have good prospects .

in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .
i have also seen - in my political activities as well as in my private and social life - that africa is often talked about , but also that many people believe it is essentially a lost continent .
if we allow this kind of thinking to get embedded in people 's heads , we would be unfair to the efforts being pursued and the progress being made in africa .
at the same time , we would also hurt ourselves because we would be teaching our young people that there is a discrepancy between our slogans , our ethic and moral vocabulary and our political intentions , on the one hand , and the reality , on the other . deutsche welle wants to expand its presence in islamic countries .
do you think this is the right thing to do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler also spoke with dw director general erik bettermann yes .
there are big problems in the middle eastern and arab countries .
there is no doubt that peace in the middle east is possible .
but a fundamental prerequisite for this is that we learn more about each other .
we know too little about the arab world , and the arab world knows too little about us .
i think , for example , that good integration of our muslim citizens is also part of a trust-building concept .
if our muslim citizens become well-integrated , if we take them in with open arms , it will also show the arab world that we have nothing against muslims .
on that basis , we could then discuss what 's important in terms of foreign policy or the fight against terrorism . over the past few months , you have voiced your opinion about several politically divisive topics .
you are thought of as a very political president .
what can we expect from the second half of your term in office ? i do n't have a policy of intervention because i am not busy enough or because i am too impatient .
i simply think that the president should contribute to the process of finding solutions for the country 's fundamental problems .
and i think that our fundamental problems are unemployment , education and integration .
if we address politically these three areas in a decisive , urgent , steady and straightforward manner , our country will have good prospects .
and i will always take part in the discussion of these topics . miodrag soric spoke to president horst köhler -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi spied on german president köhler in 1980s east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , became infamous for its surveillance operations of prominent politicians during the cold war .
german president horst köhler is the latest to be revealed as a target .
-lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- german leader calls for more active european role in iraq german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? -lrb- 15.11.2006 -rrb- opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .
barroso offers support ; meps call for resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has defended his vice president meanwhile , european commission chief jose manuel barroso expressed support for his vice president . asked about the possible publication of the pictures by focus magazine , commission spokesman laitenberger said barroso expected " people 's private sphere " to be respected .
this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .

this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

" what turkey has said is not enough and of course the union will make the decision how to continue the negotiation process with turkey , " said vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of the month . progress in turkey 's membership talks with the eu has been threatened by its refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , which it is obliged to do so under a customs accord with the 25-country bloc . turkish offer throws eu into confusion vanhanen delivered his verdict after ambassadors of the eu member states ended talks in brussels friday without agreement on turkey 's offer , national officials said .
" several members wanted the offer written down , " said an eu source . the turkish proposal involved opening a mediterranean port to vessels from eu member cyprus , and possibly an airport , for a trial period of one year .
a senior turkish official said ankara would expect a solution to the 32-year division of the island of cyprus during that 12-month period . however , there was confusion over whether there were strings attached , or how close the proposal was to addressing its commitments under the " ankara protocol " accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanhanen saw positives in the turkish offer " it does not mean the full implementation of the ankara protocol but i feel that it is very positive , " vanhanen told reporters in brussels during a video conference , adding that he hoped it is a step toward compliance . turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , in brussels for separate meetings , said there was no " conditionality " attached to the turkish proposal . but he failed to clear up the confusion .
" it is a package in order to promote cooperation and to promote common understanding and by that way resolving the resolution of the cyprus problem , " he told reporters as the talks were underway . eu unsure of real nature of concession " the real question is to know to what extent it 's completely or partially conditional , " said one european source .
" the turks have made this proposition , as usual , behind a great smokescreen .
now we have to clear the fog .

for example , the federal government can not regulate the smoker 's right to light up in local or state government offices , according to rupert scholz , a constitutional lawyer in berlin . ban withdrawal draws critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal banned smoking in most restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars the rejection of the coalition government 's original proposal , drew criticism from politicians who support a smoking ban . " what we are witnessing is the government bending to the tobacco lobby , " said social democratic parliamentarian and health expert karl lauterbach in the newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" how can it be that in the rest of europe , the rights of non-smokers are protected , but our government says that it is not possible in germany ? " carola reimann , a social democratic spokeswoman on health issues , insisted that it was legally possible to enforce a federal ban . " we can and should go ahead with the planned proposal , " she told the daily braunschweiger zeitung . but even that met with criticism , as some politicians said the original proposal did not go far enough in protecting non-smokers . " at first the ruling parties make the illogical rule that smoking would be banned in restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars , " said bärbel höhn , the opposition green party 's deputy leader .
" now they bring up constitutional obstacles .
smoking should be banned in all gastronomical establishments .
period . " complex constitutional issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's largest tobacco market next week the federal cabinet , with input from the justice and interior ministries , will issue a paper outlining the terms that the states would be required to follow , a government spokesman said thursday evening . " a comprehensive smoking ban can not be put in place without cooperation from the states , " the spokesman added .
" the constitutional issues are highly complex .
we want a constitutionally sound law that protects non-smokers in germany . " chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet , however , can prohibit tobacco consumption in federal agencies and ministries , according to the newspaper handelsblatt .
but it will be up to the individual states to ban smoking in schools , hospitals , public transport , restaurants and elsewhere . germany out of step with other european states germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
several surveys recent have also shown that the majority of germans favor prohibiting smoking , but politicians remain deeply divided over a comprehensive ban . france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with its european counterparts . a further obstacle is that many germans perceive the right to light up as a cherished personal freedom and that some see the anti-smoking lobby as having been historically tainted by the nazi hostility to smoking . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on smoking ban details germany is to ban smoking in public buildings and most restaurants , after a compromise was reached friday between the country 's two ruling parties .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .
trade is crucial for progress on other global issues we face , such as poverty and terrorism .
germany has to naturally play an important role as leader of both the eu and the g8 next year . nathan witkop interviewed jan techau -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier heads for washington to discuss eu , g8 german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to washington , where he will meet his counterpart condoleezza rice for talks on berlin 's upcoming presidencies of the eu and the g8 .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- germany offers to aid us in building ties to syria , iran germany has said it would like to support the us in creating a dialog with iran and syria and help it meet the recommendations in the newly released us baker commission 's report on iraq .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .

when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .

others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport . " it is still not clear , however , if the turkish move to open up to greek cypriot traffic is an unconditional offer or if it is linked to a parallel move by the eu on northern cyprus , " an eu diplomat told dpa .
" the key will be how these different actions are sequenced . " turkey wants trade boycott lifted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is still a divided island the eu has argued that ankara 's refusal to allow greek cypriot traffic on its territory violates its legal obligation to treat all eu states equally . but turkey , which does not recognize the republic of cyprus - an eu member since 2004 - has argued that the eu must first end its trade boycott of northern turkish cyprus . the last-minute turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . germany and france have taken a tough line , but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . germany wants accession talk " review clause " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has long been a proponent of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel , backed by french president jacques chirac , has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey so that there is no automatic resumption of accession talks .
instead this would have to be approved unanimously by all eu states . the greek and cypriot governments are also taking a tough line on the issue . given the divergences , the issue is expected to dominate a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on dec .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .
trade is crucial for progress on other global issues we face , such as poverty and terrorism .
germany has to naturally play an important role as leader of both the eu and the g8 next year . nathan witkop interviewed jan techau -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier heads for washington to discuss eu , g8 german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to washington , where he will meet his counterpart condoleezza rice for talks on berlin 's upcoming presidencies of the eu and the g8 .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- germany offers to aid us in building ties to syria , iran germany has said it would like to support the us in creating a dialog with iran and syria and help it meet the recommendations in the newly released us baker commission 's report on iraq .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

one german cyclist is feeling the full weight of the law when he could have been facing the wrath of his wife . the 30-year-old man from the southern german town of schwabach is staring a court appearance and possible fine in the face after being caught lying to both the police and his wife over an alleged mugging .
the man called the local cops late wednesday night after returning home battered and bruised , claiming to have been mugged by six youths while walking home . cyclist admits fear of wife made him do it " he said he beat off two of them , and that the rest fled through bushes behind the pavement , " peter grimm , a spokesman for police said on thursday . police , however , became suspicious after finding a wire fence behind the bushes and , grimm said , the man then " admitted he had made it all up as a cover story because he was afraid of his wife . " the man , it was then revealed , had been cycling home drunk when his inebriated state led him into a crash with a lamppost .
the injuries he claimed he had sustained in the fabricated mugging had actually come from his drunken collision with the street light . the cyclist now faces charges for being drunk while in charge of a bicycle and faking a crime .

" what turkey has said is not enough and of course the union will make the decision how to continue the negotiation process with turkey , " said vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of the month . progress in turkey 's membership talks with the eu has been threatened by its refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , which it is obliged to do so under a customs accord with the 25-country bloc . turkish offer throws eu into confusion vanhanen delivered his verdict after ambassadors of the eu member states ended talks in brussels friday without agreement on turkey 's offer , national officials said .
" several members wanted the offer written down , " said an eu source . the turkish proposal involved opening a mediterranean port to vessels from eu member cyprus , and possibly an airport , for a trial period of one year .
a senior turkish official said ankara would expect a solution to the 32-year division of the island of cyprus during that 12-month period . however , there was confusion over whether there were strings attached , or how close the proposal was to addressing its commitments under the " ankara protocol " accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanhanen saw positives in the turkish offer " it does not mean the full implementation of the ankara protocol but i feel that it is very positive , " vanhanen told reporters in brussels during a video conference , adding that he hoped it is a step toward compliance . turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , in brussels for separate meetings , said there was no " conditionality " attached to the turkish proposal . but he failed to clear up the confusion .
" it is a package in order to promote cooperation and to promote common understanding and by that way resolving the resolution of the cyprus problem , " he told reporters as the talks were underway . eu unsure of real nature of concession " the real question is to know to what extent it 's completely or partially conditional , " said one european source .
" the turks have made this proposition , as usual , behind a great smokescreen .
now we have to clear the fog . " until now , turkey has refused to open its harbors and ports to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a tiny state recognized only by ankara . ankara accuses nicosia of using its membership to snag turkey 's accession bid and extract concessions in the cyprus dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 cyprus , which like all eu members wields veto powers , swiftly rejected turkey 's new initiative as a " mockery . " to complicate matters further , turkey 's army chief general yasar buyukanit criticized his government 's offer in comments published friday . turkey 's army has been accused by the eu in the past of meddling in politics , but there has been no sign of military opposition to turkish foreign policy for many years . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup in nicosia seeking union with greece . turkey question likely to dominate next summit the european commission recommended last week that turkey 's accession process be slowed down by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that countries have to complete before they join europe 's rich club . eu foreign ministers are to discuss that recommendation in brussels on monday .
if they fail to make a decision , the bloc 's leaders will take up the issue at a summit that starts on thursday . no one , above all the current finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on december 14-15 , as opinions vary widely about whether the vast mainly-muslim but secular country should , or indeed can , be integrated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu envoys resume talks on turkey 's surprise cyprus bid european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport . " it is still not clear , however , if the turkish move to open up to greek cypriot traffic is an unconditional offer or if it is linked to a parallel move by the eu on northern cyprus , " an eu diplomat told dpa .
" the key will be how these different actions are sequenced . " turkey wants trade boycott lifted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is still a divided island the eu has argued that ankara 's refusal to allow greek cypriot traffic on its territory violates its legal obligation to treat all eu states equally . but turkey , which does not recognize the republic of cyprus - an eu member since 2004 - has argued that the eu must first end its trade boycott of northern turkish cyprus . the last-minute turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . germany and france have taken a tough line , but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . germany wants accession talk " review clause " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has long been a proponent of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel , backed by french president jacques chirac , has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey so that there is no automatic resumption of accession talks .
instead this would have to be approved unanimously by all eu states . the greek and cypriot governments are also taking a tough line on the issue . given the divergences , the issue is expected to dominate a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.12.2006 eu says turkey 's trade concession on cyprus is insufficient großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish concessions over port entries were not enough for the eu turkey 's offer to ease a trade dispute with cyprus is insufficient to stop the european union discussing a freeze on its membership bid , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said friday . " what turkey has said is not enough and of course the union will make the decision how to continue the negotiation process with turkey , " said vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of the month . progress in turkey 's membership talks with the eu has been threatened by its refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , which it is obliged to do so under a customs accord with the 25-country bloc . turkish offer throws eu into confusion vanhanen delivered his verdict after ambassadors of the eu member states ended talks in brussels friday without agreement on turkey 's offer , national officials said .
" several members wanted the offer written down , " said an eu source . the turkish proposal involved opening a mediterranean port to vessels from eu member cyprus , and possibly an airport , for a trial period of one year .
a senior turkish official said ankara would expect a solution to the 32-year division of the island of cyprus during that 12-month period . however , there was confusion over whether there were strings attached , or how close the proposal was to addressing its commitments under the " ankara protocol " accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanhanen saw positives in the turkish offer " it does not mean the full implementation of the ankara protocol but i feel that it is very positive , " vanhanen told reporters in brussels during a video conference , adding that he hoped it is a step toward compliance . turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , in brussels for separate meetings , said there was no " conditionality " attached to the turkish proposal . but he failed to clear up the confusion .
" it is a package in order to promote cooperation and to promote common understanding and by that way resolving the resolution of the cyprus problem , " he told reporters as the talks were underway . eu unsure of real nature of concession " the real question is to know to what extent it 's completely or partially conditional , " said one european source .
" the turks have made this proposition , as usual , behind a great smokescreen .
now we have to clear the fog . " until now , turkey has refused to open its harbors and ports to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a tiny state recognized only by ankara . ankara accuses nicosia of using its membership to snag turkey 's accession bid and extract concessions in the cyprus dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 cyprus , which like all eu members wields veto powers , swiftly rejected turkey 's new initiative as a " mockery . " to complicate matters further , turkey 's army chief general yasar buyukanit criticized his government 's offer in comments published friday . turkey 's army has been accused by the eu in the past of meddling in politics , but there has been no sign of military opposition to turkish foreign policy for many years . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup in nicosia seeking union with greece . turkey question likely to dominate next summit the european commission recommended last week that turkey 's accession process be slowed down by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that countries have to complete before they join europe 's rich club . eu foreign ministers are to discuss that recommendation in brussels on monday .
if they fail to make a decision , the bloc 's leaders will take up the issue at a summit that starts on thursday . no one , above all the current finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on december 14-15 , as opinions vary widely about whether the vast mainly-muslim but secular country should , or indeed can , be integrated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu envoys resume talks on turkey 's surprise cyprus bid european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc .

he spoke to dw-radio editor-in-chief miodrag soric about the challenges germany and the world are facing today . mr. president , you 've spent many years of your life abroad .
you also know germany from an external perspective .
how is germany perceived abroad ?
is this picture changing ? my impression is that it 's getting better .
the period immediately after wwii was marked by the nazi 's crimes and the discussion about guilt .
but nowadays people have realized that our development after the war was good , and that we play a very constructive and fair role in international organizations such as the un .
all this shows , i believe , that we can be proud of our country .
on the other hand , we should know that other responsibilities lie ahead of us , and that we ca n't run away from the duties that the international community must perform . you recently spoke about ethically-based journalism being able to contribute to cultural and religious understanding in the world .
what is the role of the media in the so-called dialog of cultures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited deutsche welle 's bonn headquarters the most important thing is information : fair , open information .
people out there are clever and critical .
you ca n't fool them .
and when we present our country as it is - its strengths and weaknesses - people will quickly realize that we are a reliable partner . i advocate basic standards in journalism .
the free press , so to speak , is the staple of democracy .
the free press must be responsible and that also means ethically and morally responsible .
in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .
i have also seen - in my political activities as well as in my private and social life - that africa is often talked about , but also that many people believe it is essentially a lost continent .
if we allow this kind of thinking to get embedded in people 's heads , we would be unfair to the efforts being pursued and the progress being made in africa .
at the same time , we would also hurt ourselves because we would be teaching our young people that there is a discrepancy between our slogans , our ethic and moral vocabulary and our political intentions , on the one hand , and the reality , on the other . deutsche welle wants to expand its presence in islamic countries .

there is no doubt that peace in the middle east is possible .
but a fundamental prerequisite for this is that we learn more about each other .
we know too little about the arab world , and the arab world knows too little about us .
i think , for example , that good integration of our muslim citizens is also part of a trust-building concept .
if our muslim citizens become well-integrated , if we take them in with open arms , it will also show the arab world that we have nothing against muslims .
on that basis , we could then discuss what 's important in terms of foreign policy or the fight against terrorism . over the past few months , you have voiced your opinion about several politically divisive topics .
you are thought of as a very political president .
what can we expect from the second half of your term in office ? i do n't have a policy of intervention because i am not busy enough or because i am too impatient .
i simply think that the president should contribute to the process of finding solutions for the country 's fundamental problems .
and i think that our fundamental problems are unemployment , education and integration .
if we address politically these three areas in a decisive , urgent , steady and straightforward manner , our country will have good prospects .

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .
6 , " it read .
" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .
" police and prosecutors will do everything in their power to investigate these people , " he said .
" anyone who claims they intend to perpetrate violence is punishable . " chaos ensues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are fielding threatening calls but helmut rau 's decision to go public with the warning met with widespread criticism .
no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .
" it could add up to a figure it will take a lifetime to pay off , " he said .
but the regional government insisted it had acted correctly .
" there could be nothing worse for the people affected than to be kept in the dark and overwhelmed by rumors , " said baden-württemberg 's interior minister , heribert rech .
" anyone with the slightest suspicion a killing spree might take place should not be afraid to come forward , " agreed his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia , ingo wolf .
" at stake is the safety of students , teachers and the culprit themselves . " media panic-mongering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear teenagers are being corrupted by computer games inevitably , the threats have hit germany 's headlines .
but many are wondering if the media interest does not in fact serve to spur on disaffected young people rather than to deter them . " some people use the media interest to draw attention to themselves , " federal police union president wolfgang speck told the daily die welt . micha hilgers , a psychoanalyst based in aachen , agreed .
" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them . " the surfeit of intimate details encourages teenagers to identify with the culprit , " he said .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .

"
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .

this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport . " it is still not clear , however , if the turkish move to open up to greek cypriot traffic is an unconditional offer or if it is linked to a parallel move by the eu on northern cyprus , " an eu diplomat told dpa .
" the key will be how these different actions are sequenced . " turkey wants trade boycott lifted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is still a divided island the eu has argued that ankara 's refusal to allow greek cypriot traffic on its territory violates its legal obligation to treat all eu states equally . but turkey , which does not recognize the republic of cyprus - an eu member since 2004 - has argued that the eu must first end its trade boycott of northern turkish cyprus . the last-minute turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . germany and france have taken a tough line , but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . germany wants accession talk " review clause " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has long been a proponent of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel , backed by french president jacques chirac , has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey so that there is no automatic resumption of accession talks .
instead this would have to be approved unanimously by all eu states . the greek and cypriot governments are also taking a tough line on the issue . given the divergences , the issue is expected to dominate a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on dec .

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail .

" the person has confirmed his intention is serious .

no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .

this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .
barroso offers support ; meps call for resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has defended his vice president meanwhile , european commission chief jose manuel barroso expressed support for his vice president . asked about the possible publication of the pictures by focus magazine , commission spokesman laitenberger said barroso expected " people 's private sphere " to be respected .
this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .
6 , " it read .
" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .
" police and prosecutors will do everything in their power to investigate these people , " he said .
" anyone who claims they intend to perpetrate violence is punishable . " chaos ensues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are fielding threatening calls but helmut rau 's decision to go public with the warning met with widespread criticism .
no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .

" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .
barroso offers support ; meps call for resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has defended his vice president meanwhile , european commission chief jose manuel barroso expressed support for his vice president . asked about the possible publication of the pictures by focus magazine , commission spokesman laitenberger said barroso expected " people 's private sphere " to be respected .
this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

the former germany striker was part of the team that captured the 1990 world cup crown in italy , and finished his international career with 47 goals in 108 caps . domestic success puts bradley in the frame bradley won mls coach of the year honors this year after guiding chivas into the playoffs with a mark of 10-19 with 13 drawn .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .
he lectures and consults widely and has recently proposed a world future council to speak up for the interests of future generations . jabeen bhatti interviewed jakob von uexkull send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author orhan pamuk wins nobel literature prize turkish writer orhan pamuk , the author of " my name is red " and " snow , " won the 2006 nobel literature prize , the swedish academy announced on thursday .

but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable .

the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .
he lectures and consults widely and has recently proposed a world future council to speak up for the interests of future generations . jabeen bhatti interviewed jakob von uexkull send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author orhan pamuk wins nobel literature prize turkish writer orhan pamuk , the author of " my name is red " and " snow , " won the 2006 nobel literature prize , the swedish academy announced on thursday .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .

this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .
trade is crucial for progress on other global issues we face , such as poverty and terrorism .

the eu is wondering if the move is n't just a way to avert partial suspension of membership talks . " we 've told the europeans clearly that this is not up for discussion , " cypriot foreign minister george lillikas told reporters . turkey said it is ready to open one seaport and one airport to cyprus for one year to salvage its eu accession talks , but it expects a solution to the three-decade division of the island during that period . " turkey started accession talks with the european union under the condition they would realize the -lrb- customs -rrb- protocol one year later .
they have not done this , " lillikas said .
" this is a pre-planned move by turkey to make an impression and one that we expected .
this makes a mockery of the european union as it is devoid of any serious content . " the eu has been threatening to suspend turkey 's accession talks , started in oct .
2005 , over its failure to open its harbors and ports to craft from cyprus , whose government ankara does not recognize . cautious optimism european union officials voiced cautious optimism on thursday that a last-minute turkish offer may save ankara 's troubled bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier sees positive elements in the turkish proposal finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency , said turkey 's initiative was " a positive step " but warned that the eu still needed more details . " if turkey is ready for such an unconditional move , this positive step will influence ... discussions on the continuation of turkey 's eu accession process , " tumioja said . the european commission - the eu 's executive body - also described the surprise turkish initiative as a " significant move " which needed further scrutiny . " i hope that we will soon have clarification on the exact nature of this step by the turkish government , " commission president jose manuel barroso said .
" if it is confirmed , it is obviously a very important step in the direction of complete implementation of the ankara protocol . " echoing similar views , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters in berlin that turkey appeared to be showing a " cautious readiness to make concessions . " the proposals represented " positive elements " to be taken into consideration by eu foreign ministers , who meet in brussels next week , and by the bloc 's leaders , who gather in the belgian capital for summit talks on dec .
14 and 15 . additional pressure on the eu the eleventh-hour turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel opposes turkish entry to the eu germany and france have taken a tough line but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey , which would mean that even if ankara meets eu demands , there would still have to be a unanimous decision by all eu countries to resume negotiations . significantly also , germany 's grand coalition government is badly split on turkey . merkel , who is a christian democrat opposes turkish entry to the eu .
her party is also reportedly hoping to use public hostility to ankara 's accession to win votes in european parliament elections in the spring of 2009 as well as planned german general elections in the autumn of that year . however , foreign minister steinmeier , whose social democratic party is in the german coalition , backs turkish membership . comprehensive settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is to this day a divided island earlier on thursday , a senior turkish official confirmed that turkey was ready to open two ports to cypriot craft in exchange for a comprehensive settlement of the cypriot question . " we are ready to open one port and an airport as part of our customs union responsibilities , " said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . " turkey wants a comprehensive settlement -lrb- to the cyprus conflict -rrb- within 12 months , " he said .
" this should happen under the patronage of the united nations , but the european union should lend its support . " the official said turkey also expects ercan airport , in the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- to be opened to international traffic . turkey , with a population of 70 million , would be the first mainly muslim country in the eu if it is admitted to the bloc .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable .

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .
6 , " it read .
" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .
" police and prosecutors will do everything in their power to investigate these people , " he said .
" anyone who claims they intend to perpetrate violence is punishable . " chaos ensues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are fielding threatening calls but helmut rau 's decision to go public with the warning met with widespread criticism .
no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .
" it could add up to a figure it will take a lifetime to pay off , " he said .
but the regional government insisted it had acted correctly .
" there could be nothing worse for the people affected than to be kept in the dark and overwhelmed by rumors , " said baden-württemberg 's interior minister , heribert rech .
" anyone with the slightest suspicion a killing spree might take place should not be afraid to come forward , " agreed his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia , ingo wolf .
" at stake is the safety of students , teachers and the culprit themselves . " media panic-mongering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear teenagers are being corrupted by computer games inevitably , the threats have hit germany 's headlines .
but many are wondering if the media interest does not in fact serve to spur on disaffected young people rather than to deter them . " some people use the media interest to draw attention to themselves , " federal police union president wolfgang speck told the daily die welt . micha hilgers , a psychoanalyst based in aachen , agreed .
" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them . " the surfeit of intimate details encourages teenagers to identify with the culprit , " he said .
" they think : he was as old as me , he goes to the same sort of school i do - all i need now is my grandfather 's firearm .

the eu is wondering if the move is n't just a way to avert partial suspension of membership talks . " we 've told the europeans clearly that this is not up for discussion , " cypriot foreign minister george lillikas told reporters . turkey said it is ready to open one seaport and one airport to cyprus for one year to salvage its eu accession talks , but it expects a solution to the three-decade division of the island during that period . " turkey started accession talks with the european union under the condition they would realize the -lrb- customs -rrb- protocol one year later .
they have not done this , " lillikas said .
" this is a pre-planned move by turkey to make an impression and one that we expected .
this makes a mockery of the european union as it is devoid of any serious content . " the eu has been threatening to suspend turkey 's accession talks , started in oct .
2005 , over its failure to open its harbors and ports to craft from cyprus , whose government ankara does not recognize . cautious optimism european union officials voiced cautious optimism on thursday that a last-minute turkish offer may save ankara 's troubled bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier sees positive elements in the turkish proposal finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency , said turkey 's initiative was " a positive step " but warned that the eu still needed more details . " if turkey is ready for such an unconditional move , this positive step will influence ... discussions on the continuation of turkey 's eu accession process , " tumioja said . the european commission - the eu 's executive body - also described the surprise turkish initiative as a " significant move " which needed further scrutiny . " i hope that we will soon have clarification on the exact nature of this step by the turkish government , " commission president jose manuel barroso said .
" if it is confirmed , it is obviously a very important step in the direction of complete implementation of the ankara protocol . " echoing similar views , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters in berlin that turkey appeared to be showing a " cautious readiness to make concessions . " the proposals represented " positive elements " to be taken into consideration by eu foreign ministers , who meet in brussels next week , and by the bloc 's leaders , who gather in the belgian capital for summit talks on dec .
14 and 15 . additional pressure on the eu the eleventh-hour turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel opposes turkish entry to the eu germany and france have taken a tough line but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey , which would mean that even if ankara meets eu demands , there would still have to be a unanimous decision by all eu countries to resume negotiations . significantly also , germany 's grand coalition government is badly split on turkey . merkel , who is a christian democrat opposes turkish entry to the eu .
her party is also reportedly hoping to use public hostility to ankara 's accession to win votes in european parliament elections in the spring of 2009 as well as planned german general elections in the autumn of that year . however , foreign minister steinmeier , whose social democratic party is in the german coalition , backs turkish membership . comprehensive settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is to this day a divided island earlier on thursday , a senior turkish official confirmed that turkey was ready to open two ports to cypriot craft in exchange for a comprehensive settlement of the cypriot question . " we are ready to open one port and an airport as part of our customs union responsibilities , " said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . " turkey wants a comprehensive settlement -lrb- to the cyprus conflict -rrb- within 12 months , " he said .
" this should happen under the patronage of the united nations , but the european union should lend its support . " the official said turkey also expects ercan airport , in the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- to be opened to international traffic . turkey , with a population of 70 million , would be the first mainly muslim country in the eu if it is admitted to the bloc .
even if negotiations for eu entry go smoothly , however , turkish admission is not expected before 2020 . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- eu split over imposing tougher entry conditions on turkey european union leaders have divergent views on turkey 's troubled bid to join the 25-nation bloc , with germany and france set to call for tougher conditions on ankara .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .

steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .

europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .

for example , the federal government can not regulate the smoker 's right to light up in local or state government offices , according to rupert scholz , a constitutional lawyer in berlin . ban withdrawal draws critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal banned smoking in most restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars the rejection of the coalition government 's original proposal , drew criticism from politicians who support a smoking ban . " what we are witnessing is the government bending to the tobacco lobby , " said social democratic parliamentarian and health expert karl lauterbach in the newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" how can it be that in the rest of europe , the rights of non-smokers are protected , but our government says that it is not possible in germany ? " carola reimann , a social democratic spokeswoman on health issues , insisted that it was legally possible to enforce a federal ban . " we can and should go ahead with the planned proposal , " she told the daily braunschweiger zeitung . but even that met with criticism , as some politicians said the original proposal did not go far enough in protecting non-smokers . " at first the ruling parties make the illogical rule that smoking would be banned in restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars , " said bärbel höhn , the opposition green party 's deputy leader .
" now they bring up constitutional obstacles .
smoking should be banned in all gastronomical establishments .
period . " complex constitutional issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's largest tobacco market next week the federal cabinet , with input from the justice and interior ministries , will issue a paper outlining the terms that the states would be required to follow , a government spokesman said thursday evening . " a comprehensive smoking ban can not be put in place without cooperation from the states , " the spokesman added .
" the constitutional issues are highly complex .
we want a constitutionally sound law that protects non-smokers in germany . " chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet , however , can prohibit tobacco consumption in federal agencies and ministries , according to the newspaper handelsblatt .
but it will be up to the individual states to ban smoking in schools , hospitals , public transport , restaurants and elsewhere . germany out of step with other european states germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
several surveys recent have also shown that the majority of germans favor prohibiting smoking , but politicians remain deeply divided over a comprehensive ban . france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with its european counterparts . a further obstacle is that many germans perceive the right to light up as a cherished personal freedom and that some see the anti-smoking lobby as having been historically tainted by the nazi hostility to smoking . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on smoking ban details germany is to ban smoking in public buildings and most restaurants , after a compromise was reached friday between the country 's two ruling parties .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .

the eu is wondering if the move is n't just a way to avert partial suspension of membership talks . " we 've told the europeans clearly that this is not up for discussion , " cypriot foreign minister george lillikas told reporters . turkey said it is ready to open one seaport and one airport to cyprus for one year to salvage its eu accession talks , but it expects a solution to the three-decade division of the island during that period . " turkey started accession talks with the european union under the condition they would realize the -lrb- customs -rrb- protocol one year later .
they have not done this , " lillikas said .
" this is a pre-planned move by turkey to make an impression and one that we expected .
this makes a mockery of the european union as it is devoid of any serious content . " the eu has been threatening to suspend turkey 's accession talks , started in oct .
2005 , over its failure to open its harbors and ports to craft from cyprus , whose government ankara does not recognize . cautious optimism european union officials voiced cautious optimism on thursday that a last-minute turkish offer may save ankara 's troubled bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier sees positive elements in the turkish proposal finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency , said turkey 's initiative was " a positive step " but warned that the eu still needed more details . " if turkey is ready for such an unconditional move , this positive step will influence ... discussions on the continuation of turkey 's eu accession process , " tumioja said . the european commission - the eu 's executive body - also described the surprise turkish initiative as a " significant move " which needed further scrutiny . " i hope that we will soon have clarification on the exact nature of this step by the turkish government , " commission president jose manuel barroso said .
" if it is confirmed , it is obviously a very important step in the direction of complete implementation of the ankara protocol . " echoing similar views , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters in berlin that turkey appeared to be showing a " cautious readiness to make concessions . " the proposals represented " positive elements " to be taken into consideration by eu foreign ministers , who meet in brussels next week , and by the bloc 's leaders , who gather in the belgian capital for summit talks on dec .
14 and 15 . additional pressure on the eu the eleventh-hour turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel opposes turkish entry to the eu germany and france have taken a tough line but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey , which would mean that even if ankara meets eu demands , there would still have to be a unanimous decision by all eu countries to resume negotiations . significantly also , germany 's grand coalition government is badly split on turkey . merkel , who is a christian democrat opposes turkish entry to the eu .
her party is also reportedly hoping to use public hostility to ankara 's accession to win votes in european parliament elections in the spring of 2009 as well as planned german general elections in the autumn of that year . however , foreign minister steinmeier , whose social democratic party is in the german coalition , backs turkish membership . comprehensive settlement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is to this day a divided island earlier on thursday , a senior turkish official confirmed that turkey was ready to open two ports to cypriot craft in exchange for a comprehensive settlement of the cypriot question . " we are ready to open one port and an airport as part of our customs union responsibilities , " said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . " turkey wants a comprehensive settlement -lrb- to the cyprus conflict -rrb- within 12 months , " he said .
" this should happen under the patronage of the united nations , but the european union should lend its support . " the official said turkey also expects ercan airport , in the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- to be opened to international traffic . turkey , with a population of 70 million , would be the first mainly muslim country in the eu if it is admitted to the bloc .
even if negotiations for eu entry go smoothly , however , turkish admission is not expected before 2020 . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- eu split over imposing tougher entry conditions on turkey european union leaders have divergent views on turkey 's troubled bid to join the 25-nation bloc , with germany and france set to call for tougher conditions on ankara .

the man called the local cops late wednesday night after returning home battered and bruised , claiming to have been mugged by six youths while walking home . cyclist admits fear of wife made him do it " he said he beat off two of them , and that the rest fled through bushes behind the pavement , " peter grimm , a spokesman for police said on thursday . police , however , became suspicious after finding a wire fence behind the bushes and , grimm said , the man then " admitted he had made it all up as a cover story because he was afraid of his wife . " the man , it was then revealed , had been cycling home drunk when his inebriated state led him into a crash with a lamppost .
the injuries he claimed he had sustained in the fabricated mugging had actually come from his drunken collision with the street light . the cyclist now faces charges for being drunk while in charge of a bicycle and faking a crime .

for example , the federal government can not regulate the smoker 's right to light up in local or state government offices , according to rupert scholz , a constitutional lawyer in berlin . ban withdrawal draws critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal banned smoking in most restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars the rejection of the coalition government 's original proposal , drew criticism from politicians who support a smoking ban . " what we are witnessing is the government bending to the tobacco lobby , " said social democratic parliamentarian and health expert karl lauterbach in the newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" how can it be that in the rest of europe , the rights of non-smokers are protected , but our government says that it is not possible in germany ? " carola reimann , a social democratic spokeswoman on health issues , insisted that it was legally possible to enforce a federal ban . " we can and should go ahead with the planned proposal , " she told the daily braunschweiger zeitung . but even that met with criticism , as some politicians said the original proposal did not go far enough in protecting non-smokers . " at first the ruling parties make the illogical rule that smoking would be banned in restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars , " said bärbel höhn , the opposition green party 's deputy leader .
" now they bring up constitutional obstacles .
smoking should be banned in all gastronomical establishments .
period . " complex constitutional issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's largest tobacco market next week the federal cabinet , with input from the justice and interior ministries , will issue a paper outlining the terms that the states would be required to follow , a government spokesman said thursday evening . " a comprehensive smoking ban can not be put in place without cooperation from the states , " the spokesman added .
" the constitutional issues are highly complex .
we want a constitutionally sound law that protects non-smokers in germany . " chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet , however , can prohibit tobacco consumption in federal agencies and ministries , according to the newspaper handelsblatt .
but it will be up to the individual states to ban smoking in schools , hospitals , public transport , restaurants and elsewhere . germany out of step with other european states germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
several surveys recent have also shown that the majority of germans favor prohibiting smoking , but politicians remain deeply divided over a comprehensive ban . france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with its european counterparts . a further obstacle is that many germans perceive the right to light up as a cherished personal freedom and that some see the anti-smoking lobby as having been historically tainted by the nazi hostility to smoking . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on smoking ban details germany is to ban smoking in public buildings and most restaurants , after a compromise was reached friday between the country 's two ruling parties .

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .
6 , " it read .
" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .
" police and prosecutors will do everything in their power to investigate these people , " he said .
" anyone who claims they intend to perpetrate violence is punishable . " chaos ensues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are fielding threatening calls but helmut rau 's decision to go public with the warning met with widespread criticism .
no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .
" it could add up to a figure it will take a lifetime to pay off , " he said .
but the regional government insisted it had acted correctly .
" there could be nothing worse for the people affected than to be kept in the dark and overwhelmed by rumors , " said baden-württemberg 's interior minister , heribert rech .
" anyone with the slightest suspicion a killing spree might take place should not be afraid to come forward , " agreed his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia , ingo wolf .
" at stake is the safety of students , teachers and the culprit themselves . " media panic-mongering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear teenagers are being corrupted by computer games inevitably , the threats have hit germany 's headlines .
but many are wondering if the media interest does not in fact serve to spur on disaffected young people rather than to deter them . " some people use the media interest to draw attention to themselves , " federal police union president wolfgang speck told the daily die welt . micha hilgers , a psychoanalyst based in aachen , agreed .
" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them . " the surfeit of intimate details encourages teenagers to identify with the culprit , " he said .

a german cyclist who returned home late wednesday night battered and bruised , claiming he was mugged by a gang of youths , faces criminal charges and a cold shoulder after the true events of that evening were revealed . sometimes it pays to just come clean , even when the consequences of the first misdemeanor may end up with you sleeping on the couch . everyone knows that the doghouse is far better than the courthouse .
well … nearly everyone .
one german cyclist is feeling the full weight of the law when he could have been facing the wrath of his wife . the 30-year-old man from the southern german town of schwabach is staring a court appearance and possible fine in the face after being caught lying to both the police and his wife over an alleged mugging .
the man called the local cops late wednesday night after returning home battered and bruised , claiming to have been mugged by six youths while walking home . cyclist admits fear of wife made him do it " he said he beat off two of them , and that the rest fled through bushes behind the pavement , " peter grimm , a spokesman for police said on thursday . police , however , became suspicious after finding a wire fence behind the bushes and , grimm said , the man then " admitted he had made it all up as a cover story because he was afraid of his wife . " the man , it was then revealed , had been cycling home drunk when his inebriated state led him into a crash with a lamppost .
the injuries he claimed he had sustained in the fabricated mugging had actually come from his drunken collision with the street light . the cyclist now faces charges for being drunk while in charge of a bicycle and faking a crime .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .
trade is crucial for progress on other global issues we face , such as poverty and terrorism .
germany has to naturally play an important role as leader of both the eu and the g8 next year . nathan witkop interviewed jan techau -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier heads for washington to discuss eu , g8 german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to washington , where he will meet his counterpart condoleezza rice for talks on berlin 's upcoming presidencies of the eu and the g8 .

" what turkey has said is not enough and of course the union will make the decision how to continue the negotiation process with turkey , " said vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of the month . progress in turkey 's membership talks with the eu has been threatened by its refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , which it is obliged to do so under a customs accord with the 25-country bloc . turkish offer throws eu into confusion vanhanen delivered his verdict after ambassadors of the eu member states ended talks in brussels friday without agreement on turkey 's offer , national officials said .
" several members wanted the offer written down , " said an eu source . the turkish proposal involved opening a mediterranean port to vessels from eu member cyprus , and possibly an airport , for a trial period of one year .
a senior turkish official said ankara would expect a solution to the 32-year division of the island of cyprus during that 12-month period . however , there was confusion over whether there were strings attached , or how close the proposal was to addressing its commitments under the " ankara protocol " accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanhanen saw positives in the turkish offer " it does not mean the full implementation of the ankara protocol but i feel that it is very positive , " vanhanen told reporters in brussels during a video conference , adding that he hoped it is a step toward compliance . turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , in brussels for separate meetings , said there was no " conditionality " attached to the turkish proposal . but he failed to clear up the confusion .
" it is a package in order to promote cooperation and to promote common understanding and by that way resolving the resolution of the cyprus problem , " he told reporters as the talks were underway . eu unsure of real nature of concession " the real question is to know to what extent it 's completely or partially conditional , " said one european source .
" the turks have made this proposition , as usual , behind a great smokescreen .
now we have to clear the fog . " until now , turkey has refused to open its harbors and ports to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a tiny state recognized only by ankara . ankara accuses nicosia of using its membership to snag turkey 's accession bid and extract concessions in the cyprus dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 cyprus , which like all eu members wields veto powers , swiftly rejected turkey 's new initiative as a " mockery . " to complicate matters further , turkey 's army chief general yasar buyukanit criticized his government 's offer in comments published friday . turkey 's army has been accused by the eu in the past of meddling in politics , but there has been no sign of military opposition to turkish foreign policy for many years . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup in nicosia seeking union with greece . turkey question likely to dominate next summit the european commission recommended last week that turkey 's accession process be slowed down by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that countries have to complete before they join europe 's rich club . eu foreign ministers are to discuss that recommendation in brussels on monday .
if they fail to make a decision , the bloc 's leaders will take up the issue at a summit that starts on thursday . no one , above all the current finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on december 14-15 , as opinions vary widely about whether the vast mainly-muslim but secular country should , or indeed can , be integrated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu envoys resume talks on turkey 's surprise cyprus bid european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc .

for example , the federal government can not regulate the smoker 's right to light up in local or state government offices , according to rupert scholz , a constitutional lawyer in berlin . ban withdrawal draws critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal banned smoking in most restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars the rejection of the coalition government 's original proposal , drew criticism from politicians who support a smoking ban . " what we are witnessing is the government bending to the tobacco lobby , " said social democratic parliamentarian and health expert karl lauterbach in the newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" how can it be that in the rest of europe , the rights of non-smokers are protected , but our government says that it is not possible in germany ? " carola reimann , a social democratic spokeswoman on health issues , insisted that it was legally possible to enforce a federal ban . " we can and should go ahead with the planned proposal , " she told the daily braunschweiger zeitung . but even that met with criticism , as some politicians said the original proposal did not go far enough in protecting non-smokers . " at first the ruling parties make the illogical rule that smoking would be banned in restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars , " said bärbel höhn , the opposition green party 's deputy leader .
" now they bring up constitutional obstacles .
smoking should be banned in all gastronomical establishments .

" a comprehensive smoking ban can not be put in place without cooperation from the states , " the spokesman added .
" the constitutional issues are highly complex .
we want a constitutionally sound law that protects non-smokers in germany . " chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet , however , can prohibit tobacco consumption in federal agencies and ministries , according to the newspaper handelsblatt .
but it will be up to the individual states to ban smoking in schools , hospitals , public transport , restaurants and elsewhere . germany out of step with other european states germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
several surveys recent have also shown that the majority of germans favor prohibiting smoking , but politicians remain deeply divided over a comprehensive ban . france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with its european counterparts . a further obstacle is that many germans perceive the right to light up as a cherished personal freedom and that some see the anti-smoking lobby as having been historically tainted by the nazi hostility to smoking . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on smoking ban details germany is to ban smoking in public buildings and most restaurants , after a compromise was reached friday between the country 's two ruling parties .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport . " it is still not clear , however , if the turkish move to open up to greek cypriot traffic is an unconditional offer or if it is linked to a parallel move by the eu on northern cyprus , " an eu diplomat told dpa .
" the key will be how these different actions are sequenced . " turkey wants trade boycott lifted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is still a divided island the eu has argued that ankara 's refusal to allow greek cypriot traffic on its territory violates its legal obligation to treat all eu states equally . but turkey , which does not recognize the republic of cyprus - an eu member since 2004 - has argued that the eu must first end its trade boycott of northern turkish cyprus . the last-minute turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . germany and france have taken a tough line , but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . germany wants accession talk " review clause " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has long been a proponent of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel , backed by french president jacques chirac , has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey so that there is no automatic resumption of accession talks .
instead this would have to be approved unanimously by all eu states . the greek and cypriot governments are also taking a tough line on the issue . given the divergences , the issue is expected to dominate a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on dec .

he spoke to dw-radio editor-in-chief miodrag soric about the challenges germany and the world are facing today . mr. president , you 've spent many years of your life abroad .
you also know germany from an external perspective .
how is germany perceived abroad ?
is this picture changing ? my impression is that it 's getting better .
the period immediately after wwii was marked by the nazi 's crimes and the discussion about guilt .
but nowadays people have realized that our development after the war was good , and that we play a very constructive and fair role in international organizations such as the un .
all this shows , i believe , that we can be proud of our country .
on the other hand , we should know that other responsibilities lie ahead of us , and that we ca n't run away from the duties that the international community must perform . you recently spoke about ethically-based journalism being able to contribute to cultural and religious understanding in the world .
what is the role of the media in the so-called dialog of cultures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited deutsche welle 's bonn headquarters the most important thing is information : fair , open information .
people out there are clever and critical .
you ca n't fool them .
and when we present our country as it is - its strengths and weaknesses - people will quickly realize that we are a reliable partner . i advocate basic standards in journalism .
the free press , so to speak , is the staple of democracy .
the free press must be responsible and that also means ethically and morally responsible .
in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.12.2006 eu commissioner verheugen in hot water over nudist snaps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen denies blurring the lines of private and official behavior at the commission despite official statements saying that no eu rules have been broken , european commission vice president günter verheugen is at the center of a growing scandal over nude photos of him on holiday with a female assistant . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen did not break bloc rules when he holidayed with his female cabinet director , the european commission stressed thursday , as a german magazine threatened to publish photos of the pair sunbathing nude together . " the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .

" there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .

this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

the eu is wondering if the move is n't just a way to avert partial suspension of membership talks . " we 've told the europeans clearly that this is not up for discussion , " cypriot foreign minister george lillikas told reporters . turkey said it is ready to open one seaport and one airport to cyprus for one year to salvage its eu accession talks , but it expects a solution to the three-decade division of the island during that period . " turkey started accession talks with the european union under the condition they would realize the -lrb- customs -rrb- protocol one year later .
they have not done this , " lillikas said .
" this is a pre-planned move by turkey to make an impression and one that we expected .
this makes a mockery of the european union as it is devoid of any serious content . " the eu has been threatening to suspend turkey 's accession talks , started in oct .
2005 , over its failure to open its harbors and ports to craft from cyprus , whose government ankara does not recognize . cautious optimism european union officials voiced cautious optimism on thursday that a last-minute turkish offer may save ankara 's troubled bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier sees positive elements in the turkish proposal finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency , said turkey 's initiative was " a positive step " but warned that the eu still needed more details . " if turkey is ready for such an unconditional move , this positive step will influence ... discussions on the continuation of turkey 's eu accession process , " tumioja said . the european commission - the eu 's executive body - also described the surprise turkish initiative as a " significant move " which needed further scrutiny . " i hope that we will soon have clarification on the exact nature of this step by the turkish government , " commission president jose manuel barroso said .
" if it is confirmed , it is obviously a very important step in the direction of complete implementation of the ankara protocol .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .

but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .
he lectures and consults widely and has recently proposed a world future council to speak up for the interests of future generations . jabeen bhatti interviewed jakob von uexkull send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author orhan pamuk wins nobel literature prize turkish writer orhan pamuk , the author of " my name is red " and " snow , " won the 2006 nobel literature prize , the swedish academy announced on thursday .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.12.2006 germany rejects federal smoking ban on constitutional grounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individual federal states to decide on smoking ban the decision to ban smoking in public places and restaurants is now up to germany 's federal states , due to constitutional wrinkles that complicate an outright nationwide ban . after announcing plans to prohibit smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants in early december , germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the proposal on constitutional grounds , saying that an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , according to a report in germany 's business daily handelsblatt . a nationwide smoking ban might not survive a challenge from tobacco users in the courts , so the decision to ban smoking will now be up to germany 's 16 federal states , which have extensive rights that can not be overridden by berlin .
for example , the federal government can not regulate the smoker 's right to light up in local or state government offices , according to rupert scholz , a constitutional lawyer in berlin . ban withdrawal draws critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal banned smoking in most restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars the rejection of the coalition government 's original proposal , drew criticism from politicians who support a smoking ban . " what we are witnessing is the government bending to the tobacco lobby , " said social democratic parliamentarian and health expert karl lauterbach in the newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" how can it be that in the rest of europe , the rights of non-smokers are protected , but our government says that it is not possible in germany ? " carola reimann , a social democratic spokeswoman on health issues , insisted that it was legally possible to enforce a federal ban . " we can and should go ahead with the planned proposal , " she told the daily braunschweiger zeitung . but even that met with criticism , as some politicians said the original proposal did not go far enough in protecting non-smokers . " at first the ruling parties make the illogical rule that smoking would be banned in restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars , " said bärbel höhn , the opposition green party 's deputy leader .
" now they bring up constitutional obstacles .
smoking should be banned in all gastronomical establishments .
period . " complex constitutional issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's largest tobacco market next week the federal cabinet , with input from the justice and interior ministries , will issue a paper outlining the terms that the states would be required to follow , a government spokesman said thursday evening . " a comprehensive smoking ban can not be put in place without cooperation from the states , " the spokesman added .
" the constitutional issues are highly complex .
we want a constitutionally sound law that protects non-smokers in germany . " chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet , however , can prohibit tobacco consumption in federal agencies and ministries , according to the newspaper handelsblatt .
but it will be up to the individual states to ban smoking in schools , hospitals , public transport , restaurants and elsewhere . germany out of step with other european states germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
several surveys recent have also shown that the majority of germans favor prohibiting smoking , but politicians remain deeply divided over a comprehensive ban . france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with its european counterparts . a further obstacle is that many germans perceive the right to light up as a cherished personal freedom and that some see the anti-smoking lobby as having been historically tainted by the nazi hostility to smoking . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on smoking ban details germany is to ban smoking in public buildings and most restaurants , after a compromise was reached friday between the country 's two ruling parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : nobel winners reflect on life after the prize daniel mcfadden : saving the world while staying grounded gerhard ertl : nobel is an amazing gift george akerlof : economics needed to solve global problems richard ernst : public more critical of nobel prize winners society -pipe- 08.12.2006 " the nobel prizes are quite narrow " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull founded the prizes in 1980 the right livelihood foundation will award its " alternative nobel prizes " in stockholm on friday .
dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .
he lectures and consults widely and has recently proposed a world future council to speak up for the interests of future generations . jabeen bhatti interviewed jakob von uexkull send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author orhan pamuk wins nobel literature prize turkish writer orhan pamuk , the author of " my name is red " and " snow , " won the 2006 nobel literature prize , the swedish academy announced on thursday .

no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable .

it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .

in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .

it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .
he lectures and consults widely and has recently proposed a world future council to speak up for the interests of future generations . jabeen bhatti interviewed jakob von uexkull send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author orhan pamuk wins nobel literature prize turkish writer orhan pamuk , the author of " my name is red " and " snow , " won the 2006 nobel literature prize , the swedish academy announced on thursday .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- europe lauds peace prize winner nobel laureate mohamed elbaradei was " shocked " and the international atomic energy agency he heads in ecstasy after being awarded the nobel peace prize .

the eu is wondering if the move is n't just a way to avert partial suspension of membership talks . " we 've told the europeans clearly that this is not up for discussion , " cypriot foreign minister george lillikas told reporters . turkey said it is ready to open one seaport and one airport to cyprus for one year to salvage its eu accession talks , but it expects a solution to the three-decade division of the island during that period . " turkey started accession talks with the european union under the condition they would realize the -lrb- customs -rrb- protocol one year later .
they have not done this , " lillikas said .
" this is a pre-planned move by turkey to make an impression and one that we expected .
this makes a mockery of the european union as it is devoid of any serious content . " the eu has been threatening to suspend turkey 's accession talks , started in oct .
2005 , over its failure to open its harbors and ports to craft from cyprus , whose government ankara does not recognize . cautious optimism european union officials voiced cautious optimism on thursday that a last-minute turkish offer may save ankara 's troubled bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier sees positive elements in the turkish proposal finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency , said turkey 's initiative was " a positive step " but warned that the eu still needed more details . " if turkey is ready for such an unconditional move , this positive step will influence ... discussions on the continuation of turkey 's eu accession process , " tumioja said . the european commission - the eu 's executive body - also described the surprise turkish initiative as a " significant move " which needed further scrutiny . " i hope that we will soon have clarification on the exact nature of this step by the turkish government , " commission president jose manuel barroso said .
" if it is confirmed , it is obviously a very important step in the direction of complete implementation of the ankara protocol . " echoing similar views , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters in berlin that turkey appeared to be showing a " cautious readiness to make concessions .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public .

" eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .

" in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport . " it is still not clear , however , if the turkish move to open up to greek cypriot traffic is an unconditional offer or if it is linked to a parallel move by the eu on northern cyprus , " an eu diplomat told dpa .
" the key will be how these different actions are sequenced . " turkey wants trade boycott lifted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is still a divided island the eu has argued that ankara 's refusal to allow greek cypriot traffic on its territory violates its legal obligation to treat all eu states equally . but turkey , which does not recognize the republic of cyprus - an eu member since 2004 - has argued that the eu must first end its trade boycott of northern turkish cyprus . the last-minute turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . germany and france have taken a tough line , but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . germany wants accession talk " review clause " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has long been a proponent of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel , backed by french president jacques chirac , has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey so that there is no automatic resumption of accession talks .
instead this would have to be approved unanimously by all eu states . the greek and cypriot governments are also taking a tough line on the issue . given the divergences , the issue is expected to dominate a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on dec .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.12.2006 germany rejects federal smoking ban on constitutional grounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individual federal states to decide on smoking ban the decision to ban smoking in public places and restaurants is now up to germany 's federal states , due to constitutional wrinkles that complicate an outright nationwide ban . after announcing plans to prohibit smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants in early december , germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the proposal on constitutional grounds , saying that an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , according to a report in germany 's business daily handelsblatt . a nationwide smoking ban might not survive a challenge from tobacco users in the courts , so the decision to ban smoking will now be up to germany 's 16 federal states , which have extensive rights that can not be overridden by berlin .
for example , the federal government can not regulate the smoker 's right to light up in local or state government offices , according to rupert scholz , a constitutional lawyer in berlin . ban withdrawal draws critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal banned smoking in most restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars the rejection of the coalition government 's original proposal , drew criticism from politicians who support a smoking ban . " what we are witnessing is the government bending to the tobacco lobby , " said social democratic parliamentarian and health expert karl lauterbach in the newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" how can it be that in the rest of europe , the rights of non-smokers are protected , but our government says that it is not possible in germany ? " carola reimann , a social democratic spokeswoman on health issues , insisted that it was legally possible to enforce a federal ban . " we can and should go ahead with the planned proposal , " she told the daily braunschweiger zeitung . but even that met with criticism , as some politicians said the original proposal did not go far enough in protecting non-smokers . " at first the ruling parties make the illogical rule that smoking would be banned in restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars , " said bärbel höhn , the opposition green party 's deputy leader .
" now they bring up constitutional obstacles .
smoking should be banned in all gastronomical establishments .
period . " complex constitutional issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's largest tobacco market next week the federal cabinet , with input from the justice and interior ministries , will issue a paper outlining the terms that the states would be required to follow , a government spokesman said thursday evening . " a comprehensive smoking ban can not be put in place without cooperation from the states , " the spokesman added .
" the constitutional issues are highly complex .

he spoke to dw-radio editor-in-chief miodrag soric about the challenges germany and the world are facing today . mr. president , you 've spent many years of your life abroad .
you also know germany from an external perspective .
how is germany perceived abroad ?
is this picture changing ? my impression is that it 's getting better .
the period immediately after wwii was marked by the nazi 's crimes and the discussion about guilt .
but nowadays people have realized that our development after the war was good , and that we play a very constructive and fair role in international organizations such as the un .
all this shows , i believe , that we can be proud of our country .
on the other hand , we should know that other responsibilities lie ahead of us , and that we ca n't run away from the duties that the international community must perform . you recently spoke about ethically-based journalism being able to contribute to cultural and religious understanding in the world .
what is the role of the media in the so-called dialog of cultures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited deutsche welle 's bonn headquarters the most important thing is information : fair , open information .
people out there are clever and critical .
you ca n't fool them .
and when we present our country as it is - its strengths and weaknesses - people will quickly realize that we are a reliable partner . i advocate basic standards in journalism .
the free press , so to speak , is the staple of democracy .
the free press must be responsible and that also means ethically and morally responsible .
in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .
i have also seen - in my political activities as well as in my private and social life - that africa is often talked about , but also that many people believe it is essentially a lost continent .
if we allow this kind of thinking to get embedded in people 's heads , we would be unfair to the efforts being pursued and the progress being made in africa .
at the same time , we would also hurt ourselves because we would be teaching our young people that there is a discrepancy between our slogans , our ethic and moral vocabulary and our political intentions , on the one hand , and the reality , on the other . deutsche welle wants to expand its presence in islamic countries .
do you think this is the right thing to do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler also spoke with dw director general erik bettermann yes .
there are big problems in the middle eastern and arab countries .
there is no doubt that peace in the middle east is possible .

he spoke to dw-radio editor-in-chief miodrag soric about the challenges germany and the world are facing today . mr. president , you 've spent many years of your life abroad .
you also know germany from an external perspective .
how is germany perceived abroad ?
is this picture changing ? my impression is that it 's getting better .
the period immediately after wwii was marked by the nazi 's crimes and the discussion about guilt .
but nowadays people have realized that our development after the war was good , and that we play a very constructive and fair role in international organizations such as the un .
all this shows , i believe , that we can be proud of our country .
on the other hand , we should know that other responsibilities lie ahead of us , and that we ca n't run away from the duties that the international community must perform . you recently spoke about ethically-based journalism being able to contribute to cultural and religious understanding in the world .
what is the role of the media in the so-called dialog of cultures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited deutsche welle 's bonn headquarters the most important thing is information : fair , open information .
people out there are clever and critical .
you ca n't fool them .
and when we present our country as it is - its strengths and weaknesses - people will quickly realize that we are a reliable partner . i advocate basic standards in journalism .
the free press , so to speak , is the staple of democracy .
the free press must be responsible and that also means ethically and morally responsible .
in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .
i have also seen - in my political activities as well as in my private and social life - that africa is often talked about , but also that many people believe it is essentially a lost continent .
if we allow this kind of thinking to get embedded in people 's heads , we would be unfair to the efforts being pursued and the progress being made in africa .
at the same time , we would also hurt ourselves because we would be teaching our young people that there is a discrepancy between our slogans , our ethic and moral vocabulary and our political intentions , on the one hand , and the reality , on the other . deutsche welle wants to expand its presence in islamic countries .
do you think this is the right thing to do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler also spoke with dw director general erik bettermann yes .
there are big problems in the middle eastern and arab countries .
there is no doubt that peace in the middle east is possible .
but a fundamental prerequisite for this is that we learn more about each other .
we know too little about the arab world , and the arab world knows too little about us .
i think , for example , that good integration of our muslim citizens is also part of a trust-building concept .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .
trade is crucial for progress on other global issues we face , such as poverty and terrorism .
germany has to naturally play an important role as leader of both the eu and the g8 next year . nathan witkop interviewed jan techau -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier heads for washington to discuss eu , g8 german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to washington , where he will meet his counterpart condoleezza rice for talks on berlin 's upcoming presidencies of the eu and the g8 .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- germany offers to aid us in building ties to syria , iran germany has said it would like to support the us in creating a dialog with iran and syria and help it meet the recommendations in the newly released us baker commission 's report on iraq .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.12.2006 germany rejects federal smoking ban on constitutional grounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individual federal states to decide on smoking ban the decision to ban smoking in public places and restaurants is now up to germany 's federal states , due to constitutional wrinkles that complicate an outright nationwide ban . after announcing plans to prohibit smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants in early december , germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the proposal on constitutional grounds , saying that an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , according to a report in germany 's business daily handelsblatt . a nationwide smoking ban might not survive a challenge from tobacco users in the courts , so the decision to ban smoking will now be up to germany 's 16 federal states , which have extensive rights that can not be overridden by berlin .
for example , the federal government can not regulate the smoker 's right to light up in local or state government offices , according to rupert scholz , a constitutional lawyer in berlin . ban withdrawal draws critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal banned smoking in most restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars the rejection of the coalition government 's original proposal , drew criticism from politicians who support a smoking ban . " what we are witnessing is the government bending to the tobacco lobby , " said social democratic parliamentarian and health expert karl lauterbach in the newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" how can it be that in the rest of europe , the rights of non-smokers are protected , but our government says that it is not possible in germany ? " carola reimann , a social democratic spokeswoman on health issues , insisted that it was legally possible to enforce a federal ban . " we can and should go ahead with the planned proposal , " she told the daily braunschweiger zeitung . but even that met with criticism , as some politicians said the original proposal did not go far enough in protecting non-smokers . " at first the ruling parties make the illogical rule that smoking would be banned in restaurants , but allowed it in pubs and bars , " said bärbel höhn , the opposition green party 's deputy leader .
" now they bring up constitutional obstacles .
smoking should be banned in all gastronomical establishments .
period . " complex constitutional issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is europe 's largest tobacco market next week the federal cabinet , with input from the justice and interior ministries , will issue a paper outlining the terms that the states would be required to follow , a government spokesman said thursday evening . " a comprehensive smoking ban can not be put in place without cooperation from the states , " the spokesman added .
" the constitutional issues are highly complex .
we want a constitutionally sound law that protects non-smokers in germany . " chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet , however , can prohibit tobacco consumption in federal agencies and ministries , according to the newspaper handelsblatt .
but it will be up to the individual states to ban smoking in schools , hospitals , public transport , restaurants and elsewhere . germany out of step with other european states germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
several surveys recent have also shown that the majority of germans favor prohibiting smoking , but politicians remain deeply divided over a comprehensive ban . france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with its european counterparts . a further obstacle is that many germans perceive the right to light up as a cherished personal freedom and that some see the anti-smoking lobby as having been historically tainted by the nazi hostility to smoking . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on smoking ban details germany is to ban smoking in public buildings and most restaurants , after a compromise was reached friday between the country 's two ruling parties .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport . " it is still not clear , however , if the turkish move to open up to greek cypriot traffic is an unconditional offer or if it is linked to a parallel move by the eu on northern cyprus , " an eu diplomat told dpa .

" turkey wants trade boycott lifted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is still a divided island the eu has argued that ankara 's refusal to allow greek cypriot traffic on its territory violates its legal obligation to treat all eu states equally . but turkey , which does not recognize the republic of cyprus - an eu member since 2004 - has argued that the eu must first end its trade boycott of northern turkish cyprus . the last-minute turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . germany and france have taken a tough line , but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . germany wants accession talk " review clause " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has long been a proponent of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel , backed by french president jacques chirac , has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey so that there is no automatic resumption of accession talks .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport . " it is still not clear , however , if the turkish move to open up to greek cypriot traffic is an unconditional offer or if it is linked to a parallel move by the eu on northern cyprus , " an eu diplomat told dpa .
" the key will be how these different actions are sequenced . " turkey wants trade boycott lifted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is still a divided island the eu has argued that ankara 's refusal to allow greek cypriot traffic on its territory violates its legal obligation to treat all eu states equally . but turkey , which does not recognize the republic of cyprus - an eu member since 2004 - has argued that the eu must first end its trade boycott of northern turkish cyprus . the last-minute turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . germany and france have taken a tough line , but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . germany wants accession talk " review clause " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has long been a proponent of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel , backed by french president jacques chirac , has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey so that there is no automatic resumption of accession talks .
instead this would have to be approved unanimously by all eu states . the greek and cypriot governments are also taking a tough line on the issue . given the divergences , the issue is expected to dominate a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on dec .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .

this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .
barroso offers support ; meps call for resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has defended his vice president meanwhile , european commission chief jose manuel barroso expressed support for his vice president . asked about the possible publication of the pictures by focus magazine , commission spokesman laitenberger said barroso expected " people 's private sphere " to be respected .
this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .
6 , " it read .
" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .
" police and prosecutors will do everything in their power to investigate these people , " he said .
" anyone who claims they intend to perpetrate violence is punishable . " chaos ensues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are fielding threatening calls but helmut rau 's decision to go public with the warning met with widespread criticism .
no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .
" it could add up to a figure it will take a lifetime to pay off , " he said .
but the regional government insisted it had acted correctly .
" there could be nothing worse for the people affected than to be kept in the dark and overwhelmed by rumors , " said baden-württemberg 's interior minister , heribert rech .
" anyone with the slightest suspicion a killing spree might take place should not be afraid to come forward , " agreed his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia , ingo wolf .
" at stake is the safety of students , teachers and the culprit themselves . " media panic-mongering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear teenagers are being corrupted by computer games inevitably , the threats have hit germany 's headlines .
but many are wondering if the media interest does not in fact serve to spur on disaffected young people rather than to deter them . " some people use the media interest to draw attention to themselves , " federal police union president wolfgang speck told the daily die welt . micha hilgers , a psychoanalyst based in aachen , agreed .
" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them . " the surfeit of intimate details encourages teenagers to identify with the culprit , " he said .

"
a german cyclist who returned home late wednesday night battered and bruised , claiming he was mugged by a gang of youths , faces criminal charges and a cold shoulder after the true events of that evening were revealed . sometimes it pays to just come clean , even when the consequences of the first misdemeanor may end up with you sleeping on the couch . everyone knows that the doghouse is far better than the courthouse .
well … nearly everyone .
one german cyclist is feeling the full weight of the law when he could have been facing the wrath of his wife . the 30-year-old man from the southern german town of schwabach is staring a court appearance and possible fine in the face after being caught lying to both the police and his wife over an alleged mugging .
the man called the local cops late wednesday night after returning home battered and bruised , claiming to have been mugged by six youths while walking home . cyclist admits fear of wife made him do it " he said he beat off two of them , and that the rest fled through bushes behind the pavement , " peter grimm , a spokesman for police said on thursday . police , however , became suspicious after finding a wire fence behind the bushes and , grimm said , the man then " admitted he had made it all up as a cover story because he was afraid of his wife . " the man , it was then revealed , had been cycling home drunk when his inebriated state led him into a crash with a lamppost .
the injuries he claimed he had sustained in the fabricated mugging had actually come from his drunken collision with the street light . the cyclist now faces charges for being drunk while in charge of a bicycle and faking a crime .
police had carried out a blood test that proved he was drunk when they first interviewed him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for bulky bicyclist , fatter was better where does a 440-pound man fall off his bike ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : nobel winners reflect on life after the prize daniel mcfadden : saving the world while staying grounded gerhard ertl : nobel is an amazing gift george akerlof : economics needed to solve global problems richard ernst : public more critical of nobel prize winners society -pipe- 08.12.2006 " the nobel prizes are quite narrow " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull founded the prizes in 1980 the right livelihood foundation will award its " alternative nobel prizes " in stockholm on friday .
dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .
he lectures and consults widely and has recently proposed a world future council to speak up for the interests of future generations . jabeen bhatti interviewed jakob von uexkull send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author orhan pamuk wins nobel literature prize turkish writer orhan pamuk , the author of " my name is red " and " snow , " won the 2006 nobel literature prize , the swedish academy announced on thursday .

" turkey wants a comprehensive settlement -lrb- to the cyprus conflict -rrb- within 12 months , " he said .
" this should happen under the patronage of the united nations , but the european union should lend its support . " the official said turkey also expects ercan airport , in the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- to be opened to international traffic . turkey , with a population of 70 million , would be the first mainly muslim country in the eu if it is admitted to the bloc .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .

for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .

he spoke to dw-radio editor-in-chief miodrag soric about the challenges germany and the world are facing today . mr. president , you 've spent many years of your life abroad .
you also know germany from an external perspective .
how is germany perceived abroad ?
is this picture changing ? my impression is that it 's getting better .
the period immediately after wwii was marked by the nazi 's crimes and the discussion about guilt .
but nowadays people have realized that our development after the war was good , and that we play a very constructive and fair role in international organizations such as the un .
all this shows , i believe , that we can be proud of our country .
on the other hand , we should know that other responsibilities lie ahead of us , and that we ca n't run away from the duties that the international community must perform . you recently spoke about ethically-based journalism being able to contribute to cultural and religious understanding in the world .
what is the role of the media in the so-called dialog of cultures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited deutsche welle 's bonn headquarters the most important thing is information : fair , open information .
people out there are clever and critical .
you ca n't fool them .
and when we present our country as it is - its strengths and weaknesses - people will quickly realize that we are a reliable partner . i advocate basic standards in journalism .
the free press , so to speak , is the staple of democracy .
the free press must be responsible and that also means ethically and morally responsible .
in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .
i have also seen - in my political activities as well as in my private and social life - that africa is often talked about , but also that many people believe it is essentially a lost continent .
if we allow this kind of thinking to get embedded in people 's heads , we would be unfair to the efforts being pursued and the progress being made in africa .
at the same time , we would also hurt ourselves because we would be teaching our young people that there is a discrepancy between our slogans , our ethic and moral vocabulary and our political intentions , on the one hand , and the reality , on the other . deutsche welle wants to expand its presence in islamic countries .
do you think this is the right thing to do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler also spoke with dw director general erik bettermann yes .
there are big problems in the middle eastern and arab countries .
there is no doubt that peace in the middle east is possible .
but a fundamental prerequisite for this is that we learn more about each other .
we know too little about the arab world , and the arab world knows too little about us .
i think , for example , that good integration of our muslim citizens is also part of a trust-building concept .
if our muslim citizens become well-integrated , if we take them in with open arms , it will also show the arab world that we have nothing against muslims .
on that basis , we could then discuss what 's important in terms of foreign policy or the fight against terrorism . over the past few months , you have voiced your opinion about several politically divisive topics .
you are thought of as a very political president .
what can we expect from the second half of your term in office ? i do n't have a policy of intervention because i am not busy enough or because i am too impatient .
i simply think that the president should contribute to the process of finding solutions for the country 's fundamental problems .
and i think that our fundamental problems are unemployment , education and integration .
if we address politically these three areas in a decisive , urgent , steady and straightforward manner , our country will have good prospects .
and i will always take part in the discussion of these topics . miodrag soric spoke to president horst köhler -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi spied on german president köhler in 1980s east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , became infamous for its surveillance operations of prominent politicians during the cold war .

" what turkey has said is not enough and of course the union will make the decision how to continue the negotiation process with turkey , " said vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of the month . progress in turkey 's membership talks with the eu has been threatened by its refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , which it is obliged to do so under a customs accord with the 25-country bloc . turkish offer throws eu into confusion vanhanen delivered his verdict after ambassadors of the eu member states ended talks in brussels friday without agreement on turkey 's offer , national officials said .
" several members wanted the offer written down , " said an eu source . the turkish proposal involved opening a mediterranean port to vessels from eu member cyprus , and possibly an airport , for a trial period of one year .
a senior turkish official said ankara would expect a solution to the 32-year division of the island of cyprus during that 12-month period . however , there was confusion over whether there were strings attached , or how close the proposal was to addressing its commitments under the " ankara protocol " accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanhanen saw positives in the turkish offer " it does not mean the full implementation of the ankara protocol but i feel that it is very positive , " vanhanen told reporters in brussels during a video conference , adding that he hoped it is a step toward compliance . turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , in brussels for separate meetings , said there was no " conditionality " attached to the turkish proposal . but he failed to clear up the confusion .
" it is a package in order to promote cooperation and to promote common understanding and by that way resolving the resolution of the cyprus problem , " he told reporters as the talks were underway . eu unsure of real nature of concession " the real question is to know to what extent it 's completely or partially conditional , " said one european source .
" the turks have made this proposition , as usual , behind a great smokescreen .
now we have to clear the fog . " until now , turkey has refused to open its harbors and ports to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a tiny state recognized only by ankara . ankara accuses nicosia of using its membership to snag turkey 's accession bid and extract concessions in the cyprus dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 cyprus , which like all eu members wields veto powers , swiftly rejected turkey 's new initiative as a " mockery . " to complicate matters further , turkey 's army chief general yasar buyukanit criticized his government 's offer in comments published friday . turkey 's army has been accused by the eu in the past of meddling in politics , but there has been no sign of military opposition to turkish foreign policy for many years . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup in nicosia seeking union with greece . turkey question likely to dominate next summit the european commission recommended last week that turkey 's accession process be slowed down by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that countries have to complete before they join europe 's rich club . eu foreign ministers are to discuss that recommendation in brussels on monday .
if they fail to make a decision , the bloc 's leaders will take up the issue at a summit that starts on thursday . no one , above all the current finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on december 14-15 , as opinions vary widely about whether the vast mainly-muslim but secular country should , or indeed can , be integrated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu envoys resume talks on turkey 's surprise cyprus bid european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc .

all this shows , i believe , that we can be proud of our country .
on the other hand , we should know that other responsibilities lie ahead of us , and that we ca n't run away from the duties that the international community must perform . you recently spoke about ethically-based journalism being able to contribute to cultural and religious understanding in the world .
what is the role of the media in the so-called dialog of cultures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited deutsche welle 's bonn headquarters the most important thing is information : fair , open information .
people out there are clever and critical .
you ca n't fool them .
and when we present our country as it is - its strengths and weaknesses - people will quickly realize that we are a reliable partner . i advocate basic standards in journalism .
the free press , so to speak , is the staple of democracy .
the free press must be responsible and that also means ethically and morally responsible .
in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .
i have also seen - in my political activities as well as in my private and social life - that africa is often talked about , but also that many people believe it is essentially a lost continent .
if we allow this kind of thinking to get embedded in people 's heads , we would be unfair to the efforts being pursued and the progress being made in africa .
at the same time , we would also hurt ourselves because we would be teaching our young people that there is a discrepancy between our slogans , our ethic and moral vocabulary and our political intentions , on the one hand , and the reality , on the other . deutsche welle wants to expand its presence in islamic countries .
do you think this is the right thing to do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler also spoke with dw director general erik bettermann yes .
there are big problems in the middle eastern and arab countries .
there is no doubt that peace in the middle east is possible .
but a fundamental prerequisite for this is that we learn more about each other .
we know too little about the arab world , and the arab world knows too little about us .
i think , for example , that good integration of our muslim citizens is also part of a trust-building concept .
if our muslim citizens become well-integrated , if we take them in with open arms , it will also show the arab world that we have nothing against muslims .
on that basis , we could then discuss what 's important in terms of foreign policy or the fight against terrorism . over the past few months , you have voiced your opinion about several politically divisive topics .
you are thought of as a very political president .
what can we expect from the second half of your term in office ? i do n't have a policy of intervention because i am not busy enough or because i am too impatient .
i simply think that the president should contribute to the process of finding solutions for the country 's fundamental problems .
and i think that our fundamental problems are unemployment , education and integration .
if we address politically these three areas in a decisive , urgent , steady and straightforward manner , our country will have good prospects .
and i will always take part in the discussion of these topics . miodrag soric spoke to president horst köhler -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi spied on german president köhler in 1980s east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , became infamous for its surveillance operations of prominent politicians during the cold war .
german president horst köhler is the latest to be revealed as a target .

" what turkey has said is not enough and of course the union will make the decision how to continue the negotiation process with turkey , " said vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of the month . progress in turkey 's membership talks with the eu has been threatened by its refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , which it is obliged to do so under a customs accord with the 25-country bloc . turkish offer throws eu into confusion vanhanen delivered his verdict after ambassadors of the eu member states ended talks in brussels friday without agreement on turkey 's offer , national officials said .
" several members wanted the offer written down , " said an eu source . the turkish proposal involved opening a mediterranean port to vessels from eu member cyprus , and possibly an airport , for a trial period of one year .
a senior turkish official said ankara would expect a solution to the 32-year division of the island of cyprus during that 12-month period . however , there was confusion over whether there were strings attached , or how close the proposal was to addressing its commitments under the " ankara protocol " accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanhanen saw positives in the turkish offer " it does not mean the full implementation of the ankara protocol but i feel that it is very positive , " vanhanen told reporters in brussels during a video conference , adding that he hoped it is a step toward compliance . turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , in brussels for separate meetings , said there was no " conditionality " attached to the turkish proposal . but he failed to clear up the confusion .
" it is a package in order to promote cooperation and to promote common understanding and by that way resolving the resolution of the cyprus problem , " he told reporters as the talks were underway . eu unsure of real nature of concession " the real question is to know to what extent it 's completely or partially conditional , " said one european source .
" the turks have made this proposition , as usual , behind a great smokescreen .
now we have to clear the fog . " until now , turkey has refused to open its harbors and ports to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a tiny state recognized only by ankara . ankara accuses nicosia of using its membership to snag turkey 's accession bid and extract concessions in the cyprus dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 cyprus , which like all eu members wields veto powers , swiftly rejected turkey 's new initiative as a " mockery . " to complicate matters further , turkey 's army chief general yasar buyukanit criticized his government 's offer in comments published friday . turkey 's army has been accused by the eu in the past of meddling in politics , but there has been no sign of military opposition to turkish foreign policy for many years . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup in nicosia seeking union with greece . turkey question likely to dominate next summit the european commission recommended last week that turkey 's accession process be slowed down by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that countries have to complete before they join europe 's rich club . eu foreign ministers are to discuss that recommendation in brussels on monday .
if they fail to make a decision , the bloc 's leaders will take up the issue at a summit that starts on thursday . no one , above all the current finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on december 14-15 , as opinions vary widely about whether the vast mainly-muslim but secular country should , or indeed can , be integrated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu envoys resume talks on turkey 's surprise cyprus bid european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc .

he spoke to dw-radio editor-in-chief miodrag soric about the challenges germany and the world are facing today . mr. president , you 've spent many years of your life abroad .
you also know germany from an external perspective .
how is germany perceived abroad ?
is this picture changing ? my impression is that it 's getting better .
the period immediately after wwii was marked by the nazi 's crimes and the discussion about guilt .
but nowadays people have realized that our development after the war was good , and that we play a very constructive and fair role in international organizations such as the un .
all this shows , i believe , that we can be proud of our country .
on the other hand , we should know that other responsibilities lie ahead of us , and that we ca n't run away from the duties that the international community must perform . you recently spoke about ethically-based journalism being able to contribute to cultural and religious understanding in the world .
what is the role of the media in the so-called dialog of cultures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited deutsche welle 's bonn headquarters the most important thing is information : fair , open information .
people out there are clever and critical .
you ca n't fool them .
and when we present our country as it is - its strengths and weaknesses - people will quickly realize that we are a reliable partner . i advocate basic standards in journalism .
the free press , so to speak , is the staple of democracy .
the free press must be responsible and that also means ethically and morally responsible .
in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .
i have also seen - in my political activities as well as in my private and social life - that africa is often talked about , but also that many people believe it is essentially a lost continent .
if we allow this kind of thinking to get embedded in people 's heads , we would be unfair to the efforts being pursued and the progress being made in africa .
at the same time , we would also hurt ourselves because we would be teaching our young people that there is a discrepancy between our slogans , our ethic and moral vocabulary and our political intentions , on the one hand , and the reality , on the other . deutsche welle wants to expand its presence in islamic countries .
do you think this is the right thing to do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler also spoke with dw director general erik bettermann yes .
there are big problems in the middle eastern and arab countries .
there is no doubt that peace in the middle east is possible .
but a fundamental prerequisite for this is that we learn more about each other .
we know too little about the arab world , and the arab world knows too little about us .
i think , for example , that good integration of our muslim citizens is also part of a trust-building concept .
if our muslim citizens become well-integrated , if we take them in with open arms , it will also show the arab world that we have nothing against muslims .
on that basis , we could then discuss what 's important in terms of foreign policy or the fight against terrorism . over the past few months , you have voiced your opinion about several politically divisive topics .
you are thought of as a very political president .
what can we expect from the second half of your term in office ? i do n't have a policy of intervention because i am not busy enough or because i am too impatient .
i simply think that the president should contribute to the process of finding solutions for the country 's fundamental problems .
and i think that our fundamental problems are unemployment , education and integration .
if we address politically these three areas in a decisive , urgent , steady and straightforward manner , our country will have good prospects .
and i will always take part in the discussion of these topics . miodrag soric spoke to president horst köhler -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi spied on german president köhler in 1980s east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , became infamous for its surveillance operations of prominent politicians during the cold war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : nobel winners reflect on life after the prize daniel mcfadden : saving the world while staying grounded gerhard ertl : nobel is an amazing gift george akerlof : economics needed to solve global problems richard ernst : public more critical of nobel prize winners society -pipe- 08.12.2006 " the nobel prizes are quite narrow " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull founded the prizes in 1980 the right livelihood foundation will award its " alternative nobel prizes " in stockholm on friday .
dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .
uexkull has served on the board of greenpeace , germany , and is currently on the council of governance of transparency international .
he lectures and consults widely and has recently proposed a world future council to speak up for the interests of future generations . jabeen bhatti interviewed jakob von uexkull send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author orhan pamuk wins nobel literature prize turkish writer orhan pamuk , the author of " my name is red " and " snow , " won the 2006 nobel literature prize , the swedish academy announced on thursday .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- europe lauds peace prize winner nobel laureate mohamed elbaradei was " shocked " and the international atomic energy agency he heads in ecstasy after being awarded the nobel peace prize .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : nobel winners reflect on life after the prize daniel mcfadden : saving the world while staying grounded gerhard ertl : nobel is an amazing gift george akerlof : economics needed to solve global problems richard ernst : public more critical of nobel prize winners society -pipe- 08.12.2006 " the nobel prizes are quite narrow " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull founded the prizes in 1980 the right livelihood foundation will award its " alternative nobel prizes " in stockholm on friday .
dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .

dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : nobel winners reflect on life after the prize daniel mcfadden : saving the world while staying grounded gerhard ertl : nobel is an amazing gift george akerlof : economics needed to solve global problems richard ernst : public more critical of nobel prize winners society -pipe- 08.12.2006 " the nobel prizes are quite narrow " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull founded the prizes in 1980 the right livelihood foundation will award its " alternative nobel prizes " in stockholm on friday .
dw-world.de spoke with their founder - jakob von uexkull - about the awards and what he hopes they will accomplish . dw-world.de : how did this award originate ? jakob von uexkull : i grew up in a politically aware family and later traveled much as a freelance journalist .
as a result , i saw a lot of problems around the world first-hand .
but i also saw that people working toward solutions were not always taken seriously .
when you get the nobel prize , you are taken seriously .
however , the nobel prizes are quite narrow .
they take the approach that most problems can be solved through western science , that technological progress can solve everything .
i wanted to challenge that notion , because i think that is not in the spirit of alfred nobel , who wanted to reward those who give the greatest benefit to humanity , whose work has relevance to the future .
but he was the inventor of dynamite and i was just a stamp dealer .
so i approached the nobel committee and asked them to create a prize for ecology and one that deals with efforts to help the poor .
i was turned down immediately .
so i started my own prize . how did you do that ? when i was a boy , my pacifist father took away my toy guns and replaced them with stamps .
i got thoroughly immersed in it as that world fascinated me , and i began collecting and developing this useful skill .
i sold my collection and used the proceeds -lrb- $ 1 million , 740,000 euros -rrb- to fund the prizes .
i still keep up with that world , with the contacts , and it is still a good way to get donations - at a berlin benefit concert for us recently , a man donated his collection worth about 10,000 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth manorama -lrb- in green -rrb- from india won this year what did you hope the right livelihood awards would accomplish ? i wanted to get a debate going about what are our greatest priorities , what work has the greatest benefit to mankind , what are those markers and what is courage - those " walking the talk " to quote the native americans .
i wanted to see those honored who are not just at risk of going to jail but whose work makes a difference on a lot of levels and across borders .
and i wanted to see that their solutions to certain problems be better known and replicated . how do others see the awards ? well , many others in high positions , and even nobel laureates and those in the nobel family are highly critical of the nobel prizes as too narrow .
one laureate even told me that " your awards are more in the spirit of alfred nobel , " that the nobel prizes are in the spirit of the last century and these are in the spirit of the new one .
for example , the nobel prizes for economics are quite ideological and might honor great advances in economics but they do n't generally reward work in sustainable economics .
others , some very high level people , have pushed for a new nobel prize to honor environmental work but so far have been rejected .
interestingly , though , there is now a feeling that the nobel peace prizes - which have recently shown more flexibility - have gone too far .
but i think that this is the right thing , that they should not just honor those who work to reduce armies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jakob von uexkull announces the winners who is awarded your prize ? about 100 nominations come in every year , and about half are truly deserving .
we reward people whose work is a work in progress , not grass roots activists but those who have already made an international impact but might be generally unknown or ignored by the media and who can really use this award to further their work .
we award this honor to people whose work has a lot of lessons for others . how does the award impact them ? in every case i have ever seen , it helps them beyond just sending them a check and a letter .
it mostly helps open doors for them , get the publicity and the recognition , and that is often more important than the money .
that is why we also have an honorary award , for those who do n't need the funds .
does it help some activists out of jail ?
no , not necessarily .
for example , in nigeria , it did not save activist ken saro-wiwa from execution on trumped-up charges , although his cellmate has said it did save some of his fellow activists from being killed .
but in latin america , for example , it led to economist manfred max-neef in chile being released from jail a few days later , because of the outpouring of attention and letters .
and in guatemala , helen mack , who fought for justice for her activist sister 's murder , was told by the chief of police that she was now " untouchable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chico whitaker ferreira -lrb- brazil -rrb- , daniel ellsberg -lrb- usa -rrb- and the international poetry festival of medellin also won this year do you have hope that such efforts can really make a difference ? i always feel hopeful , even if i am not optimistic .
the state of the world is worse now that when i started this -lrb- in 1980 -rrb- .
for me , hope just means that there are solutions that exist , but whether we implement them is another issue .
we are making it more difficult every day we delay .
when we have the right leadership , we do n't need a decade for change , sometimes only months . one problem is that the future has no organization to speak for it .
it is one of our core values that we want to leave the world better than we found it , but that value is not represented by an organization .
these have existed in the past .
for example , the tamils in pre-colonial india had a council of seers that examined the needs of future generations and had real power . still , when i see work by people such as those we honor , these pioneers , i am hopeful . born in uppsala , sweden , jakob von uexkull studied in sweden and germany before attending christ church at the university of oxford , from which he graduated with an m.a. in politics , philosophy and economics .
since then , the dual swedish and german national has been a writer , lecturer , professional philatelist and , at one time , a member of the european parliament -lrb- for germany 's green party -rrb- .
in 1980 , he sold his holdings of rare postage stamps to provide an initial endowment of about $ 1 million for the right livelihood awards , which award annual prizes worth about 270,000 euros on the day prior to the nobel prize ceremony .
additionally , he is a co-founder of the other economic summit -lrb- toes -rrb- , a former trustee of the new economics foundation in london , a patron of friends of the earth international and a member of the global commission to fund the united nations .

he spoke to dw-radio editor-in-chief miodrag soric about the challenges germany and the world are facing today . mr. president , you 've spent many years of your life abroad .
you also know germany from an external perspective .
how is germany perceived abroad ?
is this picture changing ? my impression is that it 's getting better .
the period immediately after wwii was marked by the nazi 's crimes and the discussion about guilt .
but nowadays people have realized that our development after the war was good , and that we play a very constructive and fair role in international organizations such as the un .
all this shows , i believe , that we can be proud of our country .
on the other hand , we should know that other responsibilities lie ahead of us , and that we ca n't run away from the duties that the international community must perform . you recently spoke about ethically-based journalism being able to contribute to cultural and religious understanding in the world .
what is the role of the media in the so-called dialog of cultures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited deutsche welle 's bonn headquarters the most important thing is information : fair , open information .
people out there are clever and critical .
you ca n't fool them .
and when we present our country as it is - its strengths and weaknesses - people will quickly realize that we are a reliable partner . i advocate basic standards in journalism .
the free press , so to speak , is the staple of democracy .
the free press must be responsible and that also means ethically and morally responsible .
in a certain situation , you do n't always have to say the first thing that comes to your mind , you also have to be responsible for it . you have made africa one of the focal points of your presidency .
why is africa so important to you ? i have seen need , hunger , death and conflict in africa .
i have also seen - in my political activities as well as in my private and social life - that africa is often talked about , but also that many people believe it is essentially a lost continent .
if we allow this kind of thinking to get embedded in people 's heads , we would be unfair to the efforts being pursued and the progress being made in africa .
at the same time , we would also hurt ourselves because we would be teaching our young people that there is a discrepancy between our slogans , our ethic and moral vocabulary and our political intentions , on the one hand , and the reality , on the other . deutsche welle wants to expand its presence in islamic countries .
do you think this is the right thing to do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler also spoke with dw director general erik bettermann yes .
there are big problems in the middle eastern and arab countries .
there is no doubt that peace in the middle east is possible .
but a fundamental prerequisite for this is that we learn more about each other .
we know too little about the arab world , and the arab world knows too little about us .
i think , for example , that good integration of our muslim citizens is also part of a trust-building concept .
if our muslim citizens become well-integrated , if we take them in with open arms , it will also show the arab world that we have nothing against muslims .
on that basis , we could then discuss what 's important in terms of foreign policy or the fight against terrorism . over the past few months , you have voiced your opinion about several politically divisive topics .
you are thought of as a very political president .
what can we expect from the second half of your term in office ? i do n't have a policy of intervention because i am not busy enough or because i am too impatient .
i simply think that the president should contribute to the process of finding solutions for the country 's fundamental problems .
and i think that our fundamental problems are unemployment , education and integration .
if we address politically these three areas in a decisive , urgent , steady and straightforward manner , our country will have good prospects .
and i will always take part in the discussion of these topics . miodrag soric spoke to president horst köhler -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi spied on german president köhler in 1980s east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , became infamous for its surveillance operations of prominent politicians during the cold war .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport . " it is still not clear , however , if the turkish move to open up to greek cypriot traffic is an unconditional offer or if it is linked to a parallel move by the eu on northern cyprus , " an eu diplomat told dpa .
" the key will be how these different actions are sequenced . " turkey wants trade boycott lifted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is still a divided island the eu has argued that ankara 's refusal to allow greek cypriot traffic on its territory violates its legal obligation to treat all eu states equally . but turkey , which does not recognize the republic of cyprus - an eu member since 2004 - has argued that the eu must first end its trade boycott of northern turkish cyprus . the last-minute turkish offer puts additional pressure on eu governments , which remain deeply divided on whether to partially suspend negotiations with ankara or continue the talks . germany and france have taken a tough line , but britain , backed by spain , italy , sweden and several eu newcomers , including poland , favor turkish accession . germany wants accession talk " review clause " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has long been a proponent of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " german chancellor angela merkel has said in recent weeks that the commission must provide a special turkey progress report by 2009 before any decision is taken on restarting talks . merkel , backed by french president jacques chirac , has also suggested the introduction of a " review clause " on turkey so that there is no automatic resumption of accession talks .
instead this would have to be approved unanimously by all eu states . the greek and cypriot governments are also taking a tough line on the issue . given the divergences , the issue is expected to dominate a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on dec .

" how can it be that in the rest of europe , the rights of non-smokers are protected , but our government says that it is not possible in germany ?

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .

" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .

no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .

" some people use the media interest to draw attention to themselves , " federal police union president wolfgang speck told the daily die welt . micha hilgers , a psychoanalyst based in aachen , agreed .
" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them .

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .
6 , " it read .
" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .
" police and prosecutors will do everything in their power to investigate these people , " he said .
" anyone who claims they intend to perpetrate violence is punishable . " chaos ensues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are fielding threatening calls but helmut rau 's decision to go public with the warning met with widespread criticism .
no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .
jürgen giessler from the offenburg police department predicted that the number of copycat incidents would continue to climb over the next few weeks and stressed the entailing financial burden .
" it could add up to a figure it will take a lifetime to pay off , " he said .
but the regional government insisted it had acted correctly .
" there could be nothing worse for the people affected than to be kept in the dark and overwhelmed by rumors , " said baden-württemberg 's interior minister , heribert rech .
" anyone with the slightest suspicion a killing spree might take place should not be afraid to come forward , " agreed his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia , ingo wolf .
" at stake is the safety of students , teachers and the culprit themselves . " media panic-mongering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear teenagers are being corrupted by computer games inevitably , the threats have hit germany 's headlines .
but many are wondering if the media interest does not in fact serve to spur on disaffected young people rather than to deter them . " some people use the media interest to draw attention to themselves , " federal police union president wolfgang speck told the daily die welt . micha hilgers , a psychoanalyst based in aachen , agreed .
" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them . " the surfeit of intimate details encourages teenagers to identify with the culprit , " he said .
" they think : he was as old as me , he goes to the same sort of school i do - all i need now is my grandfather 's firearm .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .
trade is crucial for progress on other global issues we face , such as poverty and terrorism .

" what turkey has said is not enough and of course the union will make the decision how to continue the negotiation process with turkey , " said vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of the month . progress in turkey 's membership talks with the eu has been threatened by its refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , which it is obliged to do so under a customs accord with the 25-country bloc . turkish offer throws eu into confusion vanhanen delivered his verdict after ambassadors of the eu member states ended talks in brussels friday without agreement on turkey 's offer , national officials said .
" several members wanted the offer written down , " said an eu source . the turkish proposal involved opening a mediterranean port to vessels from eu member cyprus , and possibly an airport , for a trial period of one year .
a senior turkish official said ankara would expect a solution to the 32-year division of the island of cyprus during that 12-month period . however , there was confusion over whether there were strings attached , or how close the proposal was to addressing its commitments under the " ankara protocol " accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanhanen saw positives in the turkish offer " it does not mean the full implementation of the ankara protocol but i feel that it is very positive , " vanhanen told reporters in brussels during a video conference , adding that he hoped it is a step toward compliance . turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , in brussels for separate meetings , said there was no " conditionality " attached to the turkish proposal . but he failed to clear up the confusion .
" it is a package in order to promote cooperation and to promote common understanding and by that way resolving the resolution of the cyprus problem , " he told reporters as the talks were underway . eu unsure of real nature of concession " the real question is to know to what extent it 's completely or partially conditional , " said one european source .
" the turks have made this proposition , as usual , behind a great smokescreen .
now we have to clear the fog . " until now , turkey has refused to open its harbors and ports to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a tiny state recognized only by ankara . ankara accuses nicosia of using its membership to snag turkey 's accession bid and extract concessions in the cyprus dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 cyprus , which like all eu members wields veto powers , swiftly rejected turkey 's new initiative as a " mockery . " to complicate matters further , turkey 's army chief general yasar buyukanit criticized his government 's offer in comments published friday . turkey 's army has been accused by the eu in the past of meddling in politics , but there has been no sign of military opposition to turkish foreign policy for many years . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup in nicosia seeking union with greece . turkey question likely to dominate next summit the european commission recommended last week that turkey 's accession process be slowed down by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that countries have to complete before they join europe 's rich club . eu foreign ministers are to discuss that recommendation in brussels on monday .
if they fail to make a decision , the bloc 's leaders will take up the issue at a summit that starts on thursday . no one , above all the current finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on december 14-15 , as opinions vary widely about whether the vast mainly-muslim but secular country should , or indeed can , be integrated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu envoys resume talks on turkey 's surprise cyprus bid european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.12.2006 eu commissioner verheugen in hot water over nudist snaps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen denies blurring the lines of private and official behavior at the commission despite official statements saying that no eu rules have been broken , european commission vice president günter verheugen is at the center of a growing scandal over nude photos of him on holiday with a female assistant . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen did not break bloc rules when he holidayed with his female cabinet director , the european commission stressed thursday , as a german magazine threatened to publish photos of the pair sunbathing nude together . " the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .
barroso offers support ; meps call for resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has defended his vice president meanwhile , european commission chief jose manuel barroso expressed support for his vice president . asked about the possible publication of the pictures by focus magazine , commission spokesman laitenberger said barroso expected " people 's private sphere " to be respected .
this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .
barroso offers support ; meps call for resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has defended his vice president meanwhile , european commission chief jose manuel barroso expressed support for his vice president . asked about the possible publication of the pictures by focus magazine , commission spokesman laitenberger said barroso expected " people 's private sphere " to be respected .
this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

" the private holidays of vice president verheugen in lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the commission , " said eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger .
the commission 's code of ethics states that commissioners should avoid conflicts of interest and act accordingly in public . " in relation to the code of conduct , the use of such pictures raises questions of the respect of the dignity of the persons concerned by those who use them rather than questions of the respect for the dignity of their function by the persons concerned , " he added . focus magazine said the photographs showed german verheugen with his cabinet chief petra erler on a nudist beach during a holiday that they have admitted taking together in lithuania this year . " we are still considering whether to publish them , " a spokesman for the magazine said in a statement . commissioner 's nude photos make front page news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the papers do n't make good reading for verheugen however , even though the photos have yet to see the light of day , the story is dominating the popular press in germany . bild , germany 's biggest selling daily , made the alleged nude pictures of verheugen and his chief-of-staff its lead story on thursday . " eu commissioner and his lovely cabinet boss - now there are nude photos ! " the main headline of the paper read . bild did not publish any of the photos , which allegedly show verheugen wearing only a white baseball cap with erler , also nude , while lying in the sun and swimming . nudist beaches are popular among germans and attract visitors of all ages . earlier this year , bild published on its front page pictures of verheugen with his arm draped around erler and another photo showing the couple holding hands while on vacation in lithuania . some reports in germany suggested the photograph of verheugen and erler strolling in lithuania in august was printed in revenge for a tirade by verheugen against eu bureaucrats whom he accused of being arrogant and having too much power .
some media rumors say the scandal was actively brought to light by some officials who were angered by verheugen 's strongly-worded attack .
nepotism allegations resurface with new scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen vehemently denied the nepotism claims the paper also republished details of verheugen promotion of erler to his chief-of-staff in april - which increased her monthly salary to 11,579 euros -lrb- $ 15,400 -rrb- from 9,045 euros . in april , german conservative mep markus ferber accused verheugen of " nepotism " in making the appointment . " in appointing frau erler it was apparently not only the professional qualifications which played a role , " said ferber . verheugen , a social democrat who has been married for 19 years , rejected the allegations . " there can be no doubts over the competence of frau dr. erler , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" she is an excellent administrator .
the allegation that private and official things are being mixed up here is absurd . " concerning the new allegations and photographs , verheugen has said the holiday was a " purely private affair " and that his wife was informed of it . he called the allegations " pure slander " and stated that " at the time of the appointment as well as today there has been no relationship which goes beyond friendship . "
but the fresh pictures could call these statements and the commissioner 's integrity into question , german papers noted .
the affair is irregular by normal standards of european media reporting on brussels , which tends to leave tabloid-type details of commissioners ' private lives out of the press .
barroso offers support ; meps call for resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has defended his vice president meanwhile , european commission chief jose manuel barroso expressed support for his vice president . asked about the possible publication of the pictures by focus magazine , commission spokesman laitenberger said barroso expected " people 's private sphere " to be respected .
this meant not using pictures taken in " private situations without the knowledge and or the consent of the persons concerned , " he added . verheugen 's conduct was a " private matter , not one of public interest , " said laitenberger . the spokesman said available information showed that verheugen 's private vacation in lithuania did not violate rules applicable to members of the european union 's executive . other meps were less charitable , with some calling for verheugen 's resignation .

european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc . the surprise offer comes a week after the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - called for a partial freeze in turkey 's membership talks following its refusal to allow greek cypriot ships and aircraft access to its territory . the commission said the eu should suspend eight negotiating areas out of 35 so-called chapters under discussion with ankara . several eu ministers have described the turkish initiative as significant and positive , but diplomats in brussels told the german dpa news agency that governments were still seeking to clarify several elements of the proposal . they were also anxious to see the turkish proposal in writing before eu foreign ministers - and then eu leaders - discuss it at meetings in brussels next week . still no official offer on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is reported to be willing to open a port to greek cypriot ships so far , however , ankara appears to have communicated its offer only orally to finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja , whose country holds the current eu presidency . eu sources say turkey has indicated an intention to provisionally open a major sea port to cypriot vessels for a year , pending the completion of united nations negotiations in late 2007 on the reunification of cyprus . ankara has also said it is willing to open one airport to greek cypriot flights . turkey has added , however , that " it looks forward " to eu moves to end the economic isolation of turkish cyprus by allowing international trade with the north via the port of famagusta and ercan airport .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .
trade is crucial for progress on other global issues we face , such as poverty and terrorism .
germany has to naturally play an important role as leader of both the eu and the g8 next year . nathan witkop interviewed jan techau -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier heads for washington to discuss eu , g8 german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to washington , where he will meet his counterpart condoleezza rice for talks on berlin 's upcoming presidencies of the eu and the g8 .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- germany offers to aid us in building ties to syria , iran germany has said it would like to support the us in creating a dialog with iran and syria and help it meet the recommendations in the newly released us baker commission 's report on iraq .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .

this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .
trade is crucial for progress on other global issues we face , such as poverty and terrorism .

is the country overreacting ? weeks after an armed 18-year-old attacked the scholl secondary school in emsdetten , wounding five people before killing himself , germany is in the grip of a security scare . the panic was unleashed wednesday when baden-württemberg 's education minister , helmut rau , sent the region 's schools a chilling e-mail . " an anonymous person has threatened a killing spree in his school in baden-württemberg on dec .

" the person has confirmed his intention is serious . " by friday , some 4,800 local schools had been placed under police protection ; many parents kept their children at home , and a spate of copycat threats had swept the country . schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , social democrat ralf stegner , announced that copycat callers would face stiff penalties .

" anyone who claims they intend to perpetrate violence is punishable . " chaos ensues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are fielding threatening calls but helmut rau 's decision to go public with the warning met with widespread criticism .
no sooner had rau 's e-mail come to public attention , than authorities started receiving dozens of warnings of violence .
three teenagers were detained by police in baden-württemberg on thursday .
another four suspected of planning attacks on their respective schools were arrested in separate incidents in north rhine-westphalia , while police across the country received numerous anonymous warnings from callers threatening attacks .
" what we have now is chaos , " said josef schneider , president of the baden-württemberg police union .
" the warning spread fear and uncertainty among the population and created a framework for copycat callers , " said ute vogt , leader of baden-württemberg 's opposition spd .

" some people use the media interest to draw attention to themselves , " federal police union president wolfgang speck told the daily die welt . micha hilgers , a psychoanalyst based in aachen , agreed .
" the enormous public attention - if not hysteria - is nothing less than balm to the damaged souls of these potential spree killers , " he said on radio station swr2 . youth violence expert adolf gallwitz pointed out in an interview with the daily tageszeitung that media revelations about characters such as the emsdetten student also prompt young people to sympathize with them .

"
a german cyclist who returned home late wednesday night battered and bruised , claiming he was mugged by a gang of youths , faces criminal charges and a cold shoulder after the true events of that evening were revealed . sometimes it pays to just come clean , even when the consequences of the first misdemeanor may end up with you sleeping on the couch . everyone knows that the doghouse is far better than the courthouse .
well … nearly everyone .
one german cyclist is feeling the full weight of the law when he could have been facing the wrath of his wife . the 30-year-old man from the southern german town of schwabach is staring a court appearance and possible fine in the face after being caught lying to both the police and his wife over an alleged mugging .
the man called the local cops late wednesday night after returning home battered and bruised , claiming to have been mugged by six youths while walking home . cyclist admits fear of wife made him do it " he said he beat off two of them , and that the rest fled through bushes behind the pavement , " peter grimm , a spokesman for police said on thursday . police , however , became suspicious after finding a wire fence behind the bushes and , grimm said , the man then " admitted he had made it all up as a cover story because he was afraid of his wife . " the man , it was then revealed , had been cycling home drunk when his inebriated state led him into a crash with a lamppost .
the injuries he claimed he had sustained in the fabricated mugging had actually come from his drunken collision with the street light . the cyclist now faces charges for being drunk while in charge of a bicycle and faking a crime .
police had carried out a blood test that proved he was drunk when they first interviewed him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for bulky bicyclist , fatter was better where does a 440-pound man fall off his bike ?

we saw -lrb- british prime minister -rrb- tony blair and president bush meeting in washington , and now it is germany 's turn .
originally the purpose of the trip was to talk about germany 's upcoming eu presidency , but now the trip has taken on added significance with the -lrb- deterioration of the current situation in iraq -rrb- . now that the baker commission report has been released , to what extent are germany and the united states seeing eye to eye ? we should not forget that germany has always been firmly on the side of america with regard to iran and its nuclear ambitions .
the two powers have clearly not seen eye to eye on iraq .
but now the us appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict , it seems that germany has a role to play there .
it is quite reassuring that steinmeier 's agenda for the washington -lrb- trip -rrb- includes iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the us -lrb- now -rrb- appears more ready to tie the iraq question into the greater middle east conflict " what about the palestinian-israeli conflict ?
steinmeier and us secretary of state condoleezza rice were both recently in the middle east .
what will they have to say to each other on this issue when they meet on friday ? what is imperative now is how the iraq question can be tied into resolving the greater middle east conflict .
it is very clear that the iraq problem can not be resolved without the iran problem , which is closely linked to the arab-israeli problem .
the americans have been very absent from the israeli-palestinian conflict throughout the entire bush presidency .
this needs to change , with the us being the key diplomatic player in the world .
if we want to see progress in the region , the us needs to be engaged a lot more .
i would expect talks between steinmeier and rice to be conducted along those lines . are there likely to be other thorny issues coming up , such as trade ?
there is speculation that it will become more difficult to secure trade deals now , with congress dominated by the democrats . yes , trade is always one of those technical issues being addressed on a regular basis in the transatlantic partnership .
europe needs to be concerned that the -lrb- shift of power -rrb- in congress is going for a much more protectionist , isolationist stand .
this is not a good sign , since germany has promised to bring new movement into the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- trade talks -lrb- after the latest doha round of negotiations stalled -rrb- .
the final attempt to save the wto will probably come during the german presidency , and the steinmeier agenda includes this question .
trade is crucial for progress on other global issues we face , such as poverty and terrorism .
germany has to naturally play an important role as leader of both the eu and the g8 next year . nathan witkop interviewed jan techau -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier heads for washington to discuss eu , g8 german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will travel to washington , where he will meet his counterpart condoleezza rice for talks on berlin 's upcoming presidencies of the eu and the g8 .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- germany offers to aid us in building ties to syria , iran germany has said it would like to support the us in creating a dialog with iran and syria and help it meet the recommendations in the newly released us baker commission 's report on iraq .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.12.2006 eu says turkey 's trade concession on cyprus is insufficient großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish concessions over port entries were not enough for the eu turkey 's offer to ease a trade dispute with cyprus is insufficient to stop the european union discussing a freeze on its membership bid , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said friday . " what turkey has said is not enough and of course the union will make the decision how to continue the negotiation process with turkey , " said vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of the month . progress in turkey 's membership talks with the eu has been threatened by its refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , which it is obliged to do so under a customs accord with the 25-country bloc . turkish offer throws eu into confusion vanhanen delivered his verdict after ambassadors of the eu member states ended talks in brussels friday without agreement on turkey 's offer , national officials said .
" several members wanted the offer written down , " said an eu source . the turkish proposal involved opening a mediterranean port to vessels from eu member cyprus , and possibly an airport , for a trial period of one year .
a senior turkish official said ankara would expect a solution to the 32-year division of the island of cyprus during that 12-month period . however , there was confusion over whether there were strings attached , or how close the proposal was to addressing its commitments under the " ankara protocol " accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanhanen saw positives in the turkish offer " it does not mean the full implementation of the ankara protocol but i feel that it is very positive , " vanhanen told reporters in brussels during a video conference , adding that he hoped it is a step toward compliance . turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , in brussels for separate meetings , said there was no " conditionality " attached to the turkish proposal . but he failed to clear up the confusion .
" it is a package in order to promote cooperation and to promote common understanding and by that way resolving the resolution of the cyprus problem , " he told reporters as the talks were underway . eu unsure of real nature of concession " the real question is to know to what extent it 's completely or partially conditional , " said one european source .
" the turks have made this proposition , as usual , behind a great smokescreen .
now we have to clear the fog . " until now , turkey has refused to open its harbors and ports to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a tiny state recognized only by ankara . ankara accuses nicosia of using its membership to snag turkey 's accession bid and extract concessions in the cyprus dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 cyprus , which like all eu members wields veto powers , swiftly rejected turkey 's new initiative as a " mockery . " to complicate matters further , turkey 's army chief general yasar buyukanit criticized his government 's offer in comments published friday . turkey 's army has been accused by the eu in the past of meddling in politics , but there has been no sign of military opposition to turkish foreign policy for many years . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup in nicosia seeking union with greece . turkey question likely to dominate next summit the european commission recommended last week that turkey 's accession process be slowed down by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that countries have to complete before they join europe 's rich club . eu foreign ministers are to discuss that recommendation in brussels on monday .
if they fail to make a decision , the bloc 's leaders will take up the issue at a summit that starts on thursday . no one , above all the current finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on december 14-15 , as opinions vary widely about whether the vast mainly-muslim but secular country should , or indeed can , be integrated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu envoys resume talks on turkey 's surprise cyprus bid european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- 08.12.2006 -rrb- eu bewildered by turkey 's eleventh-hour offer turkey made an unexpected last-minute offer thursday to ease a trade row with cyprus .
the eu is wondering if the move is n't just a way to avert partial suspension of membership talks .
-lrb- 08.12.2006 -rrb- turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .

" what turkey has said is not enough and of course the union will make the decision how to continue the negotiation process with turkey , " said vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of the month . progress in turkey 's membership talks with the eu has been threatened by its refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , which it is obliged to do so under a customs accord with the 25-country bloc . turkish offer throws eu into confusion vanhanen delivered his verdict after ambassadors of the eu member states ended talks in brussels friday without agreement on turkey 's offer , national officials said .
" several members wanted the offer written down , " said an eu source . the turkish proposal involved opening a mediterranean port to vessels from eu member cyprus , and possibly an airport , for a trial period of one year .
a senior turkish official said ankara would expect a solution to the 32-year division of the island of cyprus during that 12-month period . however , there was confusion over whether there were strings attached , or how close the proposal was to addressing its commitments under the " ankara protocol " accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanhanen saw positives in the turkish offer " it does not mean the full implementation of the ankara protocol but i feel that it is very positive , " vanhanen told reporters in brussels during a video conference , adding that he hoped it is a step toward compliance . turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , in brussels for separate meetings , said there was no " conditionality " attached to the turkish proposal . but he failed to clear up the confusion .
" it is a package in order to promote cooperation and to promote common understanding and by that way resolving the resolution of the cyprus problem , " he told reporters as the talks were underway . eu unsure of real nature of concession " the real question is to know to what extent it 's completely or partially conditional , " said one european source .
" the turks have made this proposition , as usual , behind a great smokescreen .
now we have to clear the fog . " until now , turkey has refused to open its harbors and ports to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to ease the international isolation of the divided island 's turkish community , a tiny state recognized only by ankara . ankara accuses nicosia of using its membership to snag turkey 's accession bid and extract concessions in the cyprus dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 cyprus , which like all eu members wields veto powers , swiftly rejected turkey 's new initiative as a " mockery . " to complicate matters further , turkey 's army chief general yasar buyukanit criticized his government 's offer in comments published friday . turkey 's army has been accused by the eu in the past of meddling in politics , but there has been no sign of military opposition to turkish foreign policy for many years . cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when turkish troops occupied the island 's northern third following a greek cypriot coup in nicosia seeking union with greece . turkey question likely to dominate next summit the european commission recommended last week that turkey 's accession process be slowed down by freezing eight of the 35 negotiating chapters that countries have to complete before they join europe 's rich club . eu foreign ministers are to discuss that recommendation in brussels on monday .
if they fail to make a decision , the bloc 's leaders will take up the issue at a summit that starts on thursday . no one , above all the current finnish presidency , is keen to see the issue dominate the summit on december 14-15 , as opinions vary widely about whether the vast mainly-muslim but secular country should , or indeed can , be integrated . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu envoys resume talks on turkey 's surprise cyprus bid european union officials resumed discussions friday on a turkish offer to open a port and possibly an airport to greek cypriot traffic , which could prevent the collapse of its troubled drive to join the 25-nation bloc .
-lrb- 08.12.2006 -rrb- eu bewildered by turkey 's eleventh-hour offer turkey made an unexpected last-minute offer thursday to ease a trade row with cyprus .
the eu is wondering if the move is n't just a way to avert partial suspension of membership talks .
-lrb- 08.12.2006 -rrb- turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .

it concludes that a high birth rate in poor nations contributes to poor health and education and environmental damage .
the global population is forecast to reach about nine billion by 2050 .
the all party parliamentary group on population , development and reproductive health will publish its report later this month .
the mdgs are going to be difficult or impossible to attain without a levelling out of population growth richard ottaway mp it has spent six months taking evidence from expert witnesses for the report , population growth - its impact on the mdgs .
" no country has ever raised itself out of poverty without stabilising population growth , " said the group 's vice-chairman , richard ottaway mp , at a seminar on population issues this week .
" and the mdgs are going to be difficult or impossible to attain without a levelling out of population growth in developing countries . "
dividing world over the course of the last century , the global population rose from under two billion to just over six billion .
the bulk of the growth came in developing countries .
" ethiopia had five million people in 1900 ; now it has 64 million , of whom eight million are receiving food aid , " said mr ottaway .
the projected figure for 2050 , he said , was 145 million .
the millennium goals 1 : eradicate extreme poverty and hunger 2 : achieve universal primary education 3 : promote gender equality and empower women 4 : reduce child mortality 5 : improve maternal health 6 : combat hiv / aids , malaria , and other diseases 7 : ensure environmental sustainability 8 : develop a global partnership for development growth is now levelling off in most of asia , latin america , and the middle east ; but in much of sub-saharan africa it remains very high .
whereas many asian countries are seeing birth rates of about two children per family , some african nations are still around five per family .
the un 's own report into the mdgs earlier this year noted that the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day in asia dropped by nearly a quarter of a billion people between 1990 and 2002 .
but in africa , the number in extreme poverty increased by 140 million .
easy as abc mr ottaway told the seminar , organised by the population and sustainability network , that high birth rates compromised adults and children through : poorer infant nutrition higher risk of death in pregnancy and childbirth less chance of receiving education " i would agree with that , " said dr tiziana leone , a population studies lecturer at the london school of economics who submitted evidence to the all party group .
" we do see an impact of rapid population growth on poverty and on the health of mothers and babies , " she told the bbc news website .
" but we are also seeing an impact of the abc rule -lrb- abstinence , be faithful , condoms -rrb- for funding health programmes which has shifted a lot of funds into the a and the b , and you 're seeing the price of condoms in uganda for instance going really high . "
the abc approach is encouraged by the us government , which was accused earlier this month by the un 's hiv / aids envoy stephen lewis of practising " incipient neo-colonialism " by telling african nations how to fight the disease .
on the environmental side , mr ottaway said the evidence was more equivocal .
earth too crowded for utopia population growth was not at the moment contributing to climate change , he said , because the fastest growth was seen in countries with the lowest emissions .
but it did contribute to strains on water resources , fish stocks , farmland , forests and wildlife .
earlier this year , the head of the british antarctic survey , chris rapley , said the earth was struggling to sustain current population levels .
period of doubt in the 1950s and 60s , concern about the earth 's burgeoning population was widespread among academics , including economists , said adair turner , who also spoke at the london seminar .
mr turner headed the british government 's pensions commission and is a former director of the confederation of british industry .

it concludes that a high birth rate in poor nations contributes to poor health and education and environmental damage .
the global population is forecast to reach about nine billion by 2050 .
the all party parliamentary group on population , development and reproductive health will publish its report later this month .
the mdgs are going to be difficult or impossible to attain without a levelling out of population growth richard ottaway mp it has spent six months taking evidence from expert witnesses for the report , population growth - its impact on the mdgs .
" no country has ever raised itself out of poverty without stabilising population growth , " said the group 's vice-chairman , richard ottaway mp , at a seminar on population issues this week .
" and the mdgs are going to be difficult or impossible to attain without a levelling out of population growth in developing countries . "
dividing world over the course of the last century , the global population rose from under two billion to just over six billion .
the bulk of the growth came in developing countries .
" ethiopia had five million people in 1900 ; now it has 64 million , of whom eight million are receiving food aid , " said mr ottaway .
the projected figure for 2050 , he said , was 145 million .
the millennium goals 1 : eradicate extreme poverty and hunger 2 : achieve universal primary education 3 : promote gender equality and empower women 4 : reduce child mortality 5 : improve maternal health 6 : combat hiv / aids , malaria , and other diseases 7 : ensure environmental sustainability 8 : develop a global partnership for development growth is now levelling off in most of asia , latin america , and the middle east ; but in much of sub-saharan africa it remains very high .
whereas many asian countries are seeing birth rates of about two children per family , some african nations are still around five per family .
the un 's own report into the mdgs earlier this year noted that the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day in asia dropped by nearly a quarter of a billion people between 1990 and 2002 .
but in africa , the number in extreme poverty increased by 140 million .
easy as abc mr ottaway told the seminar , organised by the population and sustainability network , that high birth rates compromised adults and children through : poorer infant nutrition higher risk of death in pregnancy and childbirth less chance of receiving education " i would agree with that , " said dr tiziana leone , a population studies lecturer at the london school of economics who submitted evidence to the all party group .
" we do see an impact of rapid population growth on poverty and on the health of mothers and babies , " she told the bbc news website .
" but we are also seeing an impact of the abc rule -lrb- abstinence , be faithful , condoms -rrb- for funding health programmes which has shifted a lot of funds into the a and the b , and you 're seeing the price of condoms in uganda for instance going really high . "
the abc approach is encouraged by the us government , which was accused earlier this month by the un 's hiv / aids envoy stephen lewis of practising " incipient neo-colonialism " by telling african nations how to fight the disease .
on the environmental side , mr ottaway said the evidence was more equivocal .
earth too crowded for utopia population growth was not at the moment contributing to climate change , he said , because the fastest growth was seen in countries with the lowest emissions .
but it did contribute to strains on water resources , fish stocks , farmland , forests and wildlife .
earlier this year , the head of the british antarctic survey , chris rapley , said the earth was struggling to sustain current population levels .
period of doubt in the 1950s and 60s , concern about the earth 's burgeoning population was widespread among academics , including economists , said adair turner , who also spoke at the london seminar .
mr turner headed the british government 's pensions commission and is a former director of the confederation of british industry .

" but we are also seeing an impact of the abc rule -lrb- abstinence , be faithful , condoms -rrb- for funding health programmes which has shifted a lot of funds into the a and the b , and you 're seeing the price of condoms in uganda for instance going really high . "
the abc approach is encouraged by the us government , which was accused earlier this month by the un 's hiv / aids envoy stephen lewis of practising " incipient neo-colonialism " by telling african nations how to fight the disease .
on the environmental side , mr ottaway said the evidence was more equivocal .
earth too crowded for utopia population growth was not at the moment contributing to climate change , he said , because the fastest growth was seen in countries with the lowest emissions .
but it did contribute to strains on water resources , fish stocks , farmland , forests and wildlife .
earlier this year , the head of the british antarctic survey , chris rapley , said the earth was struggling to sustain current population levels .
period of doubt in the 1950s and 60s , concern about the earth 's burgeoning population was widespread among academics , including economists , said adair turner , who also spoke at the london seminar .
mr turner headed the british government 's pensions commission and is a former director of the confederation of british industry .
" the economics community went through a period of doubting whether it should be addressing the issue , " he said .
" that was primarily for reasons of economic theory , although there were religious reasons in there too . "
now , he said , economists were revisiting the subject .
even in developed nations , said mr turner , going beyond a certain population density would impact economic progress .
he said the approach should be to tackle high birth rates with voluntary measures - providing education for women and making family planning available - with which richard ottaway agreed .
" we have the solution ; it 's not that difficult , " he said .
" the question is : will we go for it ? "

the death of the russian ex-spy alexander litvinenko has been linked to the presence of a " major dose " of radioactive polonium-210 in his body .
traces of the radioactive substance have since been discovered at various locations in london visited by mr litvinenko as well as in russia and on two british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- flights .
what is polonium-210 ?
it is a naturally occurring radioactive material that emits highly hazardous alpha -lrb- positively charged -rrb- particles .
it was first discovered by marie curie at the end of the 19th century .
there are very small amounts of polonium-210 in the soil and in the atmosphere , and everyone has a small amount of it in their body .
but at high doses , it damages tissues and organs .
however the substance , historically called radium f , is very hard for doctors to identify .
philip walker , professor of physics , university of surrey said : " this seems to have been a substance carefully chosen for its ability to be hard to detect in a person who has ingested it . "
what is the risk to other people from the dose mr litvinenko received ?
it can not pass through the skin , and must be ingested or inhaled into the body to cause damage .
and because the radiation has a very short range , it only harms nearby tissue .
however , there is a theoretical risk that anyone who came into contact with the urine , faeces , and possibly even sweat , of mr litvinenko could ingest a small amount of the polonium .
where does polonium-210 usually occur ?
it has industrial uses such as static control and as a heat source for satellite power supplies , but is not available in these areas in a form conducive to easy poisoning .
it is also present in tobacco .
professor dudley goodhead , medical research council radiation and genome stability unit , said : " to poison someone much larger amounts are required and this would have to be man-made , perhaps from particle accelerator or a nuclear reactor . "
where would someone obtain polonium-210 from ?
although it occurs naturally in the environment , acquiring enough of it to kill would require individuals with expertise and connections .
it would also need sophisticated lab facilities - and access to a nuclear reactor .
alternatively , it could have been obtained from a commercial supplier .
polonium-210 can either be extracted from rocks containing radioactive uranium or separated chemically from the substance radium-226 .
production of polonium from radium-226 would need sophisticated lab facilities because the latter substance produces dangerous levels of penetrating radiation .
is the public in danger from the traces of polonium-210 found in london , and on the ba flights ?
the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said monitoring in aircraft , hotels , offices and other venues had shown nothing of public health concern .
it said polonium-210 can only represent a radiation hazard if it is taken into the body , by breathing it in , taking it into the mouth or if it gets into a wound .
after seven workers at the millennium hotel 's pine bar , in london , tested positive for low levels of radioactive polonium-210 , the hpa said the risk to the general public was likely to be " very low " .
nevertheless , more than 200 people known to have visited the pine bar on the day the bar staff were working - 1 november - are to be offered tests for radiation .
as far as the bar staff were concerned there was " no health risk in the short term and in the long term the risk is judged to be very small on the basis of initial tests " , the hpa said .

there are very small amounts of polonium-210 in the soil and in the atmosphere , and everyone has a small amount of it in their body .
but at high doses , it damages tissues and organs .
however the substance , historically called radium f , is very hard for doctors to identify .
philip walker , professor of physics , university of surrey said : " this seems to have been a substance carefully chosen for its ability to be hard to detect in a person who has ingested it . "
what is the risk to other people from the dose mr litvinenko received ?
it can not pass through the skin , and must be ingested or inhaled into the body to cause damage .
and because the radiation has a very short range , it only harms nearby tissue .
however , there is a theoretical risk that anyone who came into contact with the urine , faeces , and possibly even sweat , of mr litvinenko could ingest a small amount of the polonium .
where does polonium-210 usually occur ?
it has industrial uses such as static control and as a heat source for satellite power supplies , but is not available in these areas in a form conducive to easy poisoning .
it is also present in tobacco .
professor dudley goodhead , medical research council radiation and genome stability unit , said : " to poison someone much larger amounts are required and this would have to be man-made , perhaps from particle accelerator or a nuclear reactor . "
where would someone obtain polonium-210 from ?
although it occurs naturally in the environment , acquiring enough of it to kill would require individuals with expertise and connections .
it would also need sophisticated lab facilities - and access to a nuclear reactor .
alternatively , it could have been obtained from a commercial supplier .
polonium-210 can either be extracted from rocks containing radioactive uranium or separated chemically from the substance radium-226 .
production of polonium from radium-226 would need sophisticated lab facilities because the latter substance produces dangerous levels of penetrating radiation .
is the public in danger from the traces of polonium-210 found in london , and on the ba flights ?
the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said monitoring in aircraft , hotels , offices and other venues had shown nothing of public health concern .
it said polonium-210 can only represent a radiation hazard if it is taken into the body , by breathing it in , taking it into the mouth or if it gets into a wound .
after seven workers at the millennium hotel 's pine bar , in london , tested positive for low levels of radioactive polonium-210 , the hpa said the risk to the general public was likely to be " very low " .
nevertheless , more than 200 people known to have visited the pine bar on the day the bar staff were working - 1 november - are to be offered tests for radiation .
as far as the bar staff were concerned there was " no health risk in the short term and in the long term the risk is judged to be very small on the basis of initial tests " , the hpa said .

" it is quite an early variety but you would certainly not expect them this time of year - the earliest would be january or february , but to have them out in flower now is pretty unique . "
he said the mild weather with very few frosts had confused the plant into thinking it was spring .
" the weather is changing - i have never known a spell like it .
" we 've just had an exceptionally mild autumn and that has just brought them into flower .
" climate change is a serious subject but when you see displays of daffodils at this time of year it does have one benefit - but obviously there are very serious implications .
" the problem is if flowers do come out at odd times , very often there are not the pollinators out there to set the seed which could have a major effect on the flowering plants throughout the uk .
" again if we had a serious frost it would wipe out the daffodils and again they would not produce any seed . "
although there are fewer than a dozen that have flowered , mr rankin said there could be more than 50 within a few days .

the study , published in the journal science , says the way the two diseases interact can help them spread faster .
when people with aids contract malaria , it causes a surge of hiv virus in their blood , making them more likely to infect a partner , the research says .
meanwhile people weakened by hiv are more likely to catch malaria .
the diseases are two of the biggest killers in africa .
viral surge scientists studying the rapid spread of hiv / aids in the city of kisumu in kenya found the spread of hiv was happening more quickly than they would expect just through risky sexual behaviour .
they investigated a link with malaria , which is prevalent in the area .
they believe that since malaria can multiply by 10 times the " viral-load " of hiv - the amount of hiv virus in an hiv-infected person 's blood - the virus can be transmitted to a sexual partner more easily .
" this biological co-factor induced by malaria has contributed considerably to the spread of hiv by increasing hiv transmission probability per sexual act , " said laith abu-raddad , co-author of the study , carried out by the fred hutchinson cancer research center and the university of washington .
" in turn , the weakening of the immune system by hiv infection has fuelled a rise in adult malaria-infection rates and may have facilitated the expansion of malaria in africa , " said another co-author , james kublin of the hutchinson center .
the scientists estimated that tens of thousands of hiv infections - perhaps 5 % of the total - and millions of malaria cases - perhaps 10 % of them - could be blamed on this co-infection .
the scientists said their findings had important implications for public health efforts - underlining the need for the authorities in sub-saharan africa to tackle the two diseases together .
they also said it showed how other factors could influence the spread of hiv .
dr kublin said genital herpes and tuberculosis were also suspected of increasing the likelihood of infection .

the study , published in the journal science , says the way the two diseases interact can help them spread faster .
when people with aids contract malaria , it causes a surge of hiv virus in their blood , making them more likely to infect a partner , the research says .
meanwhile people weakened by hiv are more likely to catch malaria .
the diseases are two of the biggest killers in africa .
viral surge scientists studying the rapid spread of hiv / aids in the city of kisumu in kenya found the spread of hiv was happening more quickly than they would expect just through risky sexual behaviour .
they investigated a link with malaria , which is prevalent in the area .
they believe that since malaria can multiply by 10 times the " viral-load " of hiv - the amount of hiv virus in an hiv-infected person 's blood - the virus can be transmitted to a sexual partner more easily .
" this biological co-factor induced by malaria has contributed considerably to the spread of hiv by increasing hiv transmission probability per sexual act , " said laith abu-raddad , co-author of the study , carried out by the fred hutchinson cancer research center and the university of washington .
" in turn , the weakening of the immune system by hiv infection has fuelled a rise in adult malaria-infection rates and may have facilitated the expansion of malaria in africa , " said another co-author , james kublin of the hutchinson center .
the scientists estimated that tens of thousands of hiv infections - perhaps 5 % of the total - and millions of malaria cases - perhaps 10 % of them - could be blamed on this co-infection .
the scientists said their findings had important implications for public health efforts - underlining the need for the authorities in sub-saharan africa to tackle the two diseases together .
they also said it showed how other factors could influence the spread of hiv .
dr kublin said genital herpes and tuberculosis were also suspected of increasing the likelihood of infection .

scientists warn that , coupled with the commercial hunting of gorillas , it may be enough to push them to extinction .
the study , published in the us journal science , looked at gorilla colonies in republic of congo and gabon .
ebola is also blamed for many chimpanzee deaths .
one of the most virulent viruses known , ebola has killed more than 1,000 people since it was first recorded in 1976 .
ebola causes viral haemorrhagic fever - massive internal and external bleeding - which can kill up to 90 % of those infected .
scientists are still working on a vaccine and there is no known cure .
ape-to-ape transmission the latest study , carried out by an international team , has confirmed previous concerns about how badly the virus is affecting gorillas .
ebola one of the most virulent viral diseases damages blood vessels and can cause extensive bleeding , diarrhoea and shock killed more than 240 people in the democratic republic of congo in 1995 transmitted by infected body fluids kills up to 90 % of victims , depending on the strain there is no cure " add commercial hunting to the mix , and we have a recipe for rapid ecological extinction , " the report says .
" ape species that were abundant and widely distributed a decade ago are rapidly being reduced to remnant populations . "
the researchers , led by magdalena bermejo of the university of barcelona , focused on western gorillas , one of two gorilla species .
the other is the eastern gorilla .
in 2002 and 2003 , several outbreaks of ebola flared up in human populations in gabon and congo .
the researchers found a " massive die-off " in gorillas in congo 's lossi sanctuary between 2002 and 2004 .
" the lossi outbreak killed about as many gorillas as survive in the entire eastern gorilla species , " the study says .
the researchers concluded that the apes were not only infected by other species , such as fruit bats , but were also transmitting the virus among themselves .
ebola was passing from group to group of the endangered animals , they found , and appeared to be spreading faster than in humans .
outbreaks of the disease in humans have sometimes been traced to the bushmeat trade .
according to world health organization figures , ebola killed 1,200 people between the first recorded human outbreak in 1976 and 2004 .

scientists warn that , coupled with the commercial hunting of gorillas , it may be enough to push them to extinction .
the study , published in the us journal science , looked at gorilla colonies in republic of congo and gabon .
ebola is also blamed for many chimpanzee deaths .
one of the most virulent viruses known , ebola has killed more than 1,000 people since it was first recorded in 1976 .
ebola causes viral haemorrhagic fever - massive internal and external bleeding - which can kill up to 90 % of those infected .
scientists are still working on a vaccine and there is no known cure .
ape-to-ape transmission the latest study , carried out by an international team , has confirmed previous concerns about how badly the virus is affecting gorillas .
ebola one of the most virulent viral diseases damages blood vessels and can cause extensive bleeding , diarrhoea and shock killed more than 240 people in the democratic republic of congo in 1995 transmitted by infected body fluids kills up to 90 % of victims , depending on the strain there is no cure " add commercial hunting to the mix , and we have a recipe for rapid ecological extinction , " the report says .
" ape species that were abundant and widely distributed a decade ago are rapidly being reduced to remnant populations . "
the researchers , led by magdalena bermejo of the university of barcelona , focused on western gorillas , one of two gorilla species .
the other is the eastern gorilla .
in 2002 and 2003 , several outbreaks of ebola flared up in human populations in gabon and congo .
the researchers found a " massive die-off " in gorillas in congo 's lossi sanctuary between 2002 and 2004 .
" the lossi outbreak killed about as many gorillas as survive in the entire eastern gorilla species , " the study says .
the researchers concluded that the apes were not only infected by other species , such as fruit bats , but were also transmitting the virus among themselves .
ebola was passing from group to group of the endangered animals , they found , and appeared to be spreading faster than in humans .
outbreaks of the disease in humans have sometimes been traced to the bushmeat trade .
according to world health organization figures , ebola killed 1,200 people between the first recorded human outbreak in 1976 and 2004 .

construction firm robin jones and sons wants to create a tip at parry 's quarry at altami , near buckley , despite opposition from local residents .
the company already carries out waste recycling at the site .
plans have been submitted to flintshire council .
if approved , the landfill would take over from the brookhill site a mile away , which shuts next year .
local resident john iball has lived in buckley road for more than 40 years and can see brookhill from his home .
he will also be able to see the new one , if and when it is opened .
he said : " for the past three decades we have had landfill sites within a mile of our home . "
he said the site would bring " all the attendant problems . "
gregg robins , contracts manager with robin jones and sons , confirmed the application was to carry domestic and commercial waste .
he added : " it will mean that flintshire council taxpayers will avoid the extra cost of waste being taken to landfills outside the county . "

women are drinking more , and getting violent with it .
kirsten maile is bright , attractive and eloquent .
she wants to study to be an underwater diving photographer .
she is also on probation for abh - actual bodily harm - after she rammed a bottle into a girl 's face .
nor is it the first time that she has lashed out while drunk .
she has twice been charged with common assault , and claims to have " wrapped a girl 's ponytail around my hand and smashed her face against a basin " .
kirsten has now sought help " it does n't seem that big a deal to me .
you see it on the tv , on the streets , loads of fights .
every time i have ever hit someone , i 've been drunk .
it 's easier to lash out , harder to hold on . "
she knows that it may just be a matter of time before she loses her rag again .
and if she gets caught , she 'll go to prison .
dr jon cole , of liverpool university 's school of psychology , says that while alcohol does n't make people more aggressive , it stops us making sensible choices : " you make the easiest choice , which is often aggression . "
violent women survey 9 % physically attacked by woman who seems drunk 41 % seen woman who seems drunk attack someone else 60 % say number of women getting drunk and aggressive is higher than five years ago 31 % say it 's about the same icm surveyed 1,129 people aged 18-34 in a survey for bbc three 's bashing booze birds , almost one in 10 people aged 18 to 34 say they have been physically attacked by a drunk woman .
and 41 % say they have seen a woman who appears to be drunk attack someone else .
kirsten knows alcohol triggers her short fuse , but believes there are other factors .
" i grew up watching people around me using alcohol as an escape route .
there was aggression in the house ; my father and his girlfriend physically fighting , constantly arguing .
me and my father , me and my mother arguing down the phone .
one big argument . "
kirsten has now sought help for her problems with alcohol and aggression .
binge britain part of the problem is that britons drink twice as much as in the 1950s , and are drinking more in single sittings .
among 18- to 24-year-olds , only one in four women and one in six men say they never binge , according to the institute of alcohol studies .
among 20-something women , 60 % of the alcohol they consume is in bouts of heavy drinking - more than six units a day .
nicky o 'conner , out in cardiff last month , the government launched a £ 4m campaign to stop binge and under-age drinking .
alcohol alters judgement and perception and can lead people to take risks with their health and safety that they would not normally consider .
nicky o 'conner , of cardiff , says alcohol makes her more confident - and more chippy .
" if a girl looks at you , gives you a dirty look , you stick up for yourself - ' what 's your problem ? " '
although there are no official figures on alcohol-related crime , it is estimated to cost £ 7.3bn a year .
criminologist douglas sharpe , a former police officer , says many violent offences occur close to licensed premises .
" we are constantly being told that crime is falling , and yet violent crime is rising and one of the reasons violent crime is rising is because of alcohol . "
the glasgow centre for the study of violence sent its researchers out to monitor pub fights ; women were involved in almost half of all the pub fights they observed .
according to medical research , testosterone - the hormone connected to male characteristics such as aggression and sex drive - rises in women by up to 50 % when they get drunk .
in men , it falls .
to test this theory , journalist nicky taylor got in a boxing ring sober , and after downing a bottle of wine .
before drinking , her main concern was not getting hurt -lrb- and keeping her bra straps in place -rrb- .
drunk - and with her testosterone levels up 10 % - she let fly , regardless of the consequences .
a woman 's place it is not just that more women are drinking more ; the liquor industry is courting the female pound with a vengeance , designing drinks and venues specifically to appeal to women and their increasing disposable income .
drunk in the ring the now ubiquitous all bar one chain was among the first , opening in sutton , south london , in 1994 .
two women came up with the concept for the mitchells and butlers brewery - they wanted somewhere they 'd feel comfortable going on their own .
today , the traditional boozer is an endangered species .
instead women flock to bars made-over with big windows , stylish sofas , chandeliers and posh loos .
and to drink ?
think pink .
rose dominates the wine list , and cocktails are the order of the day .
with more women in employment , there 's money to spend on going out for a good time .
but that good time can fast turn sour , as nadia , a 25-year-old mother of one , can attest .
she lost an eye when a drunk woman threw a pint glass at her .
a two-inch shard punctured her eyeball .
her attacker was sentenced to 18 months in prison , but has only served five .
nadia , meanwhile , has a glass eye and will have operations for the rest of her life .
" i hate her .
i just absolutely hate her , " she says .

this debate has now closed .
here 's a selection of your comments : i was attacked by 4 drunk teenages , which included 2 girls and 2 boys .
it was a completely unprovoked attack , and now thankfully one of the girls has been charged with affray .
unfortunaley the other three were never caught .
i do believe young woman these days get very violent when drunk , as they do n't think about what they are doing at the time and it 's like they are invinsible .
i have seen many incidents whilst out on a night in town , where young woman have been thrown out of clubs and fighting in the street .
it 's not a good look .
i think it 's bad enough to see men fighting , but women ... it 's not right rachel , its nice to be able to be a women now and have a friendly stylish place to go and enjoy a drink or get in a mess women can have fun aswell but yes , women are so agressive now its like they have to prove a point the roles have changed from back in the day its the men wanting to have fun with no worries ! and the women causing the problem .. ive even seen women throw bottles at men .. do they think thats ok because they can say they had a drink ? or i suppose they 'd say they were threatened by the mans behaviour ?
i worked in a busy bar 8 out of ten were women fighting the other 2 were men fighting over women haha lauren , liverpool i used to be bars manager in our students union so i have seen many drink fueled fights first hand , and i would tend to agree that women can be far more vicious when they fight .
dan , guildford when i have worked as a bar man in a hotel and we had a policy that large groups of women were not allowed in as they had a tendency to get violent .
groups of men were easy enough to handle but women were awful .
i have had things thrown at me if i refused to serv them and other customers would be attached for giving the girls " the eye " .
also from my nights on the town i can confidently say most the people making a scene have been women .
so much for being lady like , seeing girls in thi state is not attractive at all .
friday morning , oxford i ca n't help thinking there is nothing worse than an otherwise well-presented , well-spoken , girl totally out of her face and abusive to everyone around her ... reminds me of drunken football hooligans .
if you ca n't control yourself when drunk , the answer is simple : do n't drink ! ! !
only boring or shoallow people need to be drunk to enjoy themselves .
jason , london , uk a problem with research of this type is that they use the units that were introduced in the 80 's when we were drinking sweet german wines at 9 % and fizzy lager / beers 3.5 % .
the reality is that the problem is far worse with wine being drunk in 175/250 ml measures at 12 % and lager / beers at 5 % .
bringing these higher stength drinks in line with the unit guidelines suggests that people are drinking far moe thsan they realise .
the sooner the government looks at it from this perspective and address it with adequate funding in alcohol education and treatment services the bettr .
paul , devon uk i ca n't much be bothered to comment on binge drinking ; i 've done it and i 've grown out of it , as i expect most people will .
what does worry me is that someone can assault you , cause you to lose an eye and gets only 5 months in jail for it .
10 years , minimum .
5 months , or the original 18 months , it 's just pathetic. steve , london women getting drunk is n't a new phenomenon .
10-20 years ago when i had my " drinking years " , my male and female friends would get completely hammered almost every friday after work .
some continued through the weekend .
what i ca n't fathom though is the apparent increase in violence from women .
of course there was violence through drink in my day but it was usually men , not women , although there were exceptions .
it is puzzling to read about women becoming violent when drunk because when sober , most of us abhor all kinds of violence .
it simply is n't in our genes to either approve of , or enjoy it .
personally , i think anyone using violence when drunk should be punished in the same way as they would have been if they were sober .
drunkenness is n't an excuse and if someone knows they become violent when drunk , they should n't drink to excess .
if they do , then they are being totally irresponsible and in some ways , that makes any offence of violence even worse because it could have been avoided .
aw , south yorks there is nothing more unbecoming than a lady hurling expletives under the influence of the devil 's water .
the rising number bashing booze-hound birds is just another sad indication that society is unravelling like a big wooly jumper snagged on the exposed nail of decadence .
ace , london this is a real problem , irrespective of gender .
we do not seem to be able to break this cycle of drinking and violent behaviour simply through stricter door policies and by extending opening hours -lrb- although they are both steps in the right direction , imho -rrb- .
time to go back to the classroom and educate children about the dangers of drinking like we do about unsafe sex .
if we can make binge drinking -lrb- more -rrb- socially unacceptable , we may foster the fabled " european " approach to this type of socialising .
dave wright , cheltenham , uk gone are the days for many where the hand that rocks the cradle fails to set an example of respectable and proper behavoir .
andrew corsham , london ah. the battle for equality seems to have been won .
women are equally as stupid as men now ..
we should all be so proud .
on the plus side i can show these stories to my young daughters and explain that this is not what they want to encounter and most definately do not want to emulate .
richard , huddersfield bashing booze birds ? which came first , i wonder , the title or the actual research. julian evans , moscow is n't this article just an advertisement of the bbc 's programme on 10 december ?
is n't the bbc supposed to be anti-advertising ?
john j. , london absolutely disgraceful .
whats the point in putting yourself in danger for 1 night of drinking , especially when you have kids .
not a very good example to set for them for when they get older .
when are people going to realise that drinking alcohol is not worth it and only ruins lives ?
sarah , nottingham has anyone looked at the problems some women have in conceiving and their drinking habits prior to that ?
ivf is difficult , expensive and painful enough to go through without the need for ivf being self-inflicted .
cmm , london bashing booze birds ?
is this itv.com ? matt armes , norwich reading the above account of nadia loosing an eye , and her attacker being sentenced to 18 months , but serving a mere 5 is testament to why violent attacks are so frequent , and on the increase .
being intoxicated should never be taken as an excuse , or as a mitigating circumstance for such terrible violence being used .
until sentences reflect the gravity of the injury inflicted , a perfect example being as here when a young woman will spend the rest of her life with only one eye , then this sort of act will continue ! !
this governments wanton recklessness and utterly corrupt stupidity in bringing in 24 hour drinking to a country with nothing like a ' cafe culture ' will be reflected in accounts of violence like the one above ..
r. attenborough , nottingham in plymouth the police had a caravan where they would " deposit " drunken people to recover .
the experiment was successful , and i believe they now have a grant for a building for this purpose .
this relieves a & e departments and prosecutions , and limits the violence caused by alcohol .
should this not be a repeated exercise in other cities which have the problem of binge drinking ?
i think this could also be expanded upon to identify those with a severe alcohol problem and staff either in the new building give couselling sessions , possibly with a.a. and assist attenders in their withdrawal .
a.p.cull , totnes devon u.k. when i lived in exmouth , devon down dy the sea , yes , the town with 36 pubs , you would have more drunk women then men and they used start about 80 % of the fights.you used to see them bashing each other out in the pubs and the strand gardens.over the years a number of pubs were done over to represent goldfish bowls with pink walls and cumfy sofa 's , the women were notorious for being more violent than the men.the number of aggressive violent , drunk women / girls was shocking , they somehow see themselves better and bigger than men when their drunk.a few of the female drinkers i went out with got like this , the more they got drunk the bigger their imaginary testicles got , unbelieveable , just goes to show whatt this dump of a country is turning into .
stewart runalls , chippenham , wiltshire i think that alot of these problems have come about because of the feminist movement .
girls think that becasue they can , they have to , do everything to the same extreme as men , men not liking this think they have to go further , so the amount we drink goes up and up .
they 've taken our jobs , they 've taken our wages and now ?
now they get randy and violent when they are drunk .
is there nothing sacred anymore ? ! ?
ian hughes , carlisle i really think that its unfair to focus solely on women 's reactions to drink.the violence carried out by drunk men is taken for granted -lrb- ' boys will be boys ' -rrb- and barely commented on .
is it really one rule for ' us ' , and one for ' them ' ?
you even use the phrase ' a woman 's place ' - implying the unspoken ' is in the home ' .
it is not in the home , and drunken violence should be targeted as one issue , without this sexist focus on women . , i think this story cleraly highlights the fact that some women have lost all respect for themselves .
i enjoy a drink and going to my local pub at the weekends but never get to the point where i 'm so drunk i think i can take on the world , i think it 's embrassing to wake up in the morning thinking ' what have i done ' as for punching people and getting in fights it 's a bit sad really , it 's bad enough when guys do but when you see girls fighting it 's disgusting .
but girls are getting more aggressive and i am sometimes worried that i 'm going to be ' started on ' because i 've looked at someone funny -lrb- not meaning to -rrb- as for the girl featured in your article i 'm glad shes getting help as i would n't want to meet her on a night out !
you ca n't always blame your behaviour on your upbringing we are all capable of making the right decision .
jo , burgess hill why do stories about alcohol-related violence only make headlines when those responsible are female ?
all alcohol-related violence is a problem and should be addressed , gender is n't an issue here .
violent drunken males should be treated with equal contempt .

a.p.cull , totnes devon u.k. when i lived in exmouth , devon down dy the sea , yes , the town with 36 pubs , you would have more drunk women then men and they used start about 80 % of the fights.you used to see them bashing each other out in the pubs and the strand gardens.over the years a number of pubs were done over to represent goldfish bowls with pink walls and cumfy sofa 's , the women were notorious for being more violent than the men.the number of aggressive violent , drunk women / girls was shocking , they somehow see themselves better and bigger than men when their drunk.a few of the female drinkers i went out with got like this , the more they got drunk the bigger their imaginary testicles got , unbelieveable , just goes to show whatt this dump of a country is turning into .
stewart runalls , chippenham , wiltshire i think that alot of these problems have come about because of the feminist movement .
girls think that becasue they can , they have to , do everything to the same extreme as men , men not liking this think they have to go further , so the amount we drink goes up and up .
they 've taken our jobs , they 've taken our wages and now ?
now they get randy and violent when they are drunk .
is there nothing sacred anymore ? ! ?
ian hughes , carlisle i really think that its unfair to focus solely on women 's reactions to drink.the violence carried out by drunk men is taken for granted -lrb- ' boys will be boys ' -rrb- and barely commented on .
is it really one rule for ' us ' , and one for ' them ' ?
you even use the phrase ' a woman 's place ' - implying the unspoken ' is in the home ' .
it is not in the home , and drunken violence should be targeted as one issue , without this sexist focus on women . , i think this story cleraly highlights the fact that some women have lost all respect for themselves .
i enjoy a drink and going to my local pub at the weekends but never get to the point where i 'm so drunk i think i can take on the world , i think it 's embrassing to wake up in the morning thinking ' what have i done ' as for punching people and getting in fights it 's a bit sad really , it 's bad enough when guys do but when you see girls fighting it 's disgusting .
but girls are getting more aggressive and i am sometimes worried that i 'm going to be ' started on ' because i 've looked at someone funny -lrb- not meaning to -rrb- as for the girl featured in your article i 'm glad shes getting help as i would n't want to meet her on a night out !
you ca n't always blame your behaviour on your upbringing we are all capable of making the right decision .
jo , burgess hill why do stories about alcohol-related violence only make headlines when those responsible are female ?
all alcohol-related violence is a problem and should be addressed , gender is n't an issue here .
violent drunken males should be treated with equal contempt .
