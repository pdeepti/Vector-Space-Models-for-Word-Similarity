that 's how we could make it hard for them . what about your third opponent in the preliminaries , costa rica ? we respect costa rica , as we do all of the other teams .
they will be at the world cup , because they earned it . how far will ecuador make it at the world cup ? it depends on how well we work .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany .

in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles .

" he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .

it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .

in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

" in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2006 teenage attacker triggers debate about world cup security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one act of violence can create mayhem a 16-year-old ran amok at the opening of berlin 's new central station saturday , sparking new doubts about safety during the imminent world cup and prompting politicians to call for a stricter response to youth crime . just weeks ahead of the world cup , a teenager 's injuring of 28 people at the opening celebrations for the capital 's new station saturday provided a chilling demonstration of just how easy it is to create havoc at public gatherings . but unlike the upcoming soccer bonanza , the event at the weekend took place without police controls - an omission described with hindsight by the weekly die welt newspaper as " foolish . " speaking in berlin , cdu parliamentarian frank henkel stressed that the violent attack perpetrated was an isolated incident carried out by just one troubled individual , but conceded that 100 percent security simply can not be guaranteed . " even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .
" we will never be able to prevent these incidents , but we need to raise the bar for potential copycat occurrences . " playing safe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts worry the fan mile migth be a troublespot according to current plans , the fan mile will be fenced in and monitored by surveillance cameras .
the entrances will be guarded by private security teams stopping anyone from taking bottles or potential weapons such as baseball bats onto the premises .
they will also be allowed - but not required - to search bags . safety will be even tighter over at the adidas arena in front of the reichstag and at the olympic stadium , with even sales-people , paramedics and sponsor representatives obliged to submit to criminal police office data checks . further safety concerns include excessive alcohol consumption , which berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting has proposed tackling with a formal restriction , and the risk of radical muslim terrorism , which has been described by interior minister wolfgang schäuble as the most serious threat . getting tough with juvenile offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence is on the rise but with experts agreeing that draconian safety precautions can not be maintained at all public events across the city , many believe the solution is deterrent measures such as the introduction of stricter sentencing for juvenile offenders - especially in the light of the recent increased incidence of youth crime and gang activities .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

" in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking . " bozonnet 's decision was condemned in art circles in france , where handke lives , and by artists from further afield , including austrian nobel literature prize laureate elfriede jelinek . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed author handke awarded german literary prize controversial austrian playwright and novelist peter handke was awarded the city of düsseldorf 's heine prize for literature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 29.05.2006 world cup patriotism in black , red and gold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans soccer fans decked out in their national colors german national fervor surfaces during world cup soccer matches , but many germans still feel uncomfortable about waving the tricolor flag outside of sports events . what would freud have said about repressed national pride ?
it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?
besides wearing the flag , it is now also possible to paste it anywhere and everywhere with deutschband , a 66-meter -lrb- 217-feet -rrb- roll of packaging tape in tricolor horizontal stripes .
" this was our own personal project for the world cup , " said arne schultchen of feldmann + schultchen , whose industrial design clients include bacardi , europcar and microsoft . " the user is supposed to have fun with the tape , which is skin friendly and wo n't damage car paint .
being a designer with an awareness of branding , i wanted the flag colors to become a national brand , and seep into daily consciousness with 1001 creative uses , " said schultchen . but even the 40-year-old müller , who grew up in a generation that associated patriotism with the far right , admitted : " the only time i identify myself with being german is at the world cup .
if the german team makes it to the final , it will be a psychological boost for us , but i wo n't overestimate its importance in solving the budget deficit and unemployment .

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .
the coal is burned in a steam chamber with pure oxygen .
the resulting smoke is cleaned , separated from the carbon dioxide and liquefied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant in hesse , germany however , this technology does have a few snags .
for one , efficiency suffers during the process .
traditional coal plants turn about 45 percent of the coal used into electricity .
with the oxyfuel process , around 35 percent of the coal becomes power .
the process is also not cheap and experts estimate the costs for separating and storing a ton of co2 at from 25 to 40 euros . storing the gas is also a challenge .
at present , gas and oil fields , coal seams and salt mines are under discussion . coal stocks healthy one of the biggest advantages of the new process is the availability of coal , stocks of which in germany should last for another century . " innovative technologies are needed especially in eastern germany , where coal is firmly anchored , " chancellor merkel said .
" but the significance of this process goes beyond brandenburg .
the future of generating electricity from coal is a concern for all of germany . " such words do not sit well with environmentalists , many of whom would like to reduce any dependence on fossil fuels .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "

it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .

german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .
germany has already pledged to have resolved the issue once and for all by 2009 . path strewn with obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants a god reference in the constitution it 's an ambitious goal , and may yet land berlin in hot water .
german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .
but no one can seriously believe that the european public will be fooled just by switching a label . plassnick , meanwhile , is no doubt looking forward to the day when she can pass the buck to her successor . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles .

" he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish . " in the interview that turned into a rambling ideological debate with spiegel reporters , ahmadinejad insisted that iran 's controversial nuclear program was for peaceful purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 29.05.2006 world cup patriotism in black , red and gold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans soccer fans decked out in their national colors german national fervor surfaces during world cup soccer matches , but many germans still feel uncomfortable about waving the tricolor flag outside of sports events . what would freud have said about repressed national pride ?
it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?
besides wearing the flag , it is now also possible to paste it anywhere and everywhere with deutschband , a 66-meter -lrb- 217-feet -rrb- roll of packaging tape in tricolor horizontal stripes .
" this was our own personal project for the world cup , " said arne schultchen of feldmann + schultchen , whose industrial design clients include bacardi , europcar and microsoft . " the user is supposed to have fun with the tape , which is skin friendly and wo n't damage car paint .
being a designer with an awareness of branding , i wanted the flag colors to become a national brand , and seep into daily consciousness with 1001 creative uses , " said schultchen . but even the 40-year-old müller , who grew up in a generation that associated patriotism with the far right , admitted : " the only time i identify myself with being german is at the world cup .
if the german team makes it to the final , it will be a psychological boost for us , but i wo n't overestimate its importance in solving the budget deficit and unemployment .

" speaking in berlin , cdu parliamentarian frank henkel stressed that the violent attack perpetrated was an isolated incident carried out by just one troubled individual , but conceded that 100 percent security simply can not be guaranteed . " even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .
" we will never be able to prevent these incidents , but we need to raise the bar for potential copycat occurrences . " playing safe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts worry the fan mile migth be a troublespot according to current plans , the fan mile will be fenced in and monitored by surveillance cameras .
the entrances will be guarded by private security teams stopping anyone from taking bottles or potential weapons such as baseball bats onto the premises .
they will also be allowed - but not required - to search bags . safety will be even tighter over at the adidas arena in front of the reichstag and at the olympic stadium , with even sales-people , paramedics and sponsor representatives obliged to submit to criminal police office data checks . further safety concerns include excessive alcohol consumption , which berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting has proposed tackling with a formal restriction , and the risk of radical muslim terrorism , which has been described by interior minister wolfgang schäuble as the most serious threat . getting tough with juvenile offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence is on the rise but with experts agreeing that draconian safety precautions can not be maintained at all public events across the city , many believe the solution is deterrent measures such as the introduction of stricter sentencing for juvenile offenders - especially in the light of the recent increased incidence of youth crime and gang activities . " the minimum age for youth detention should be reduced -lrb- from 14 -rrb- to 12 , " argued martin linder from the liberal fdp .
" that does not mean that the priority is locking up young offenders but rather to take a remedial approach before they hit that slippery slope .
it 's about getting them back on the straight and narrow as early as possible . " ultimately , the real and present danger during the world cup is unlikely to originate with teenagers who 've had too much to drink or with terrorism .
recent weeks have seen rumors proliferate that hooligans are planning riots in areas such as the tiergarten park in central berlin . police say they are taking information like this very seriously , and have emphasized they are well-prepared to deal with hooligan violence . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .
the coal is burned in a steam chamber with pure oxygen .
the resulting smoke is cleaned , separated from the carbon dioxide and liquefied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant in hesse , germany however , this technology does have a few snags .
for one , efficiency suffers during the process .
traditional coal plants turn about 45 percent of the coal used into electricity .
with the oxyfuel process , around 35 percent of the coal becomes power .
the process is also not cheap and experts estimate the costs for separating and storing a ton of co2 at from 25 to 40 euros . storing the gas is also a challenge .
at present , gas and oil fields , coal seams and salt mines are under discussion . coal stocks healthy one of the biggest advantages of the new process is the availability of coal , stocks of which in germany should last for another century . " innovative technologies are needed especially in eastern germany , where coal is firmly anchored , " chancellor merkel said .
" but the significance of this process goes beyond brandenburg .
the future of generating electricity from coal is a concern for all of germany . " such words do not sit well with environmentalists , many of whom would like to reduce any dependence on fossil fuels .
on monday , protestors from the environmental group bund blew whistles and shouted slogans to stop using coal all together . but merkel said that the coal plant pilot project is attracting attention from abroad and that it , along with german know-how and technological innovation , could become a powerful export possibility .
but that could take some time .
if the technology works once the pilot plant is built , vattenfall wants to build a 300-megawatt facility by around 2015 .
estimates are that the technology could be commercially viable by around 2020 . sabine kinkartz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .
while an increase in the number of flights likely will translate into cheaper air alternatives in europe , it 's also expected to result in a positive ripple effect in the entire tourism sector . aida cama -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

" in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking . " bozonnet 's decision was condemned in art circles in france , where handke lives , and by artists from further afield , including austrian nobel literature prize laureate elfriede jelinek . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed author handke awarded german literary prize controversial austrian playwright and novelist peter handke was awarded the city of düsseldorf 's heine prize for literature .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa .

it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?
besides wearing the flag , it is now also possible to paste it anywhere and everywhere with deutschband , a 66-meter -lrb- 217-feet -rrb- roll of packaging tape in tricolor horizontal stripes .
" this was our own personal project for the world cup , " said arne schultchen of feldmann + schultchen , whose industrial design clients include bacardi , europcar and microsoft . " the user is supposed to have fun with the tape , which is skin friendly and wo n't damage car paint .
being a designer with an awareness of branding , i wanted the flag colors to become a national brand , and seep into daily consciousness with 1001 creative uses , " said schultchen . but even the 40-year-old müller , who grew up in a generation that associated patriotism with the far right , admitted : " the only time i identify myself with being german is at the world cup .
if the german team makes it to the final , it will be a psychological boost for us , but i wo n't overestimate its importance in solving the budget deficit and unemployment . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de supermodel laments lack of german patriotism german model nadja auermann has weighed in on the issue of national pride .
-lrb- may 18 , 2004 -rrb- fears of nationalism as pop pushes german pride young germans have long labored under the weight of guilt from the nation 's past but have recently pushed for more pride in their country .
however , pro-german lyrics in pop songs are causing concern .
-lrb- sept .
15 , 2004 -rrb- olympic spirit shines through as germany boosts belgium sportsmanship is one thing but taking part in an olympic discipline for the glory of another country is taking it to the extreme .
it 's not exactly what 's happened but the germans are certainly giving belgium a hand .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany .

him saying something like that is huge motivation for me .
it animates me to work more and harder , to exert myself more every day .
the world cup is soccer 's biggest showcase . what do you have planned for the world cup ? i will do my best .

i 'm training hard for it .
my goal is to show the world my talent . what do you want to achieve at the world cup ? above all , to ensure a fixed place in my club , villareal .
i would be satisfied with that . how does your experience in the spanish league benefit ecuador 's national team ? the experience has helped me , us , very much .
the chance to play with people like riquelme in villareal or other soccer greats has made me more mature as a soccer player .
i 've learned a lot from it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valencia joined villereal last year your coach has always stressed that ecuador 's strength lays in the team 's closeness .

we 've felt this way for years .
it started with our former coach , dario gomez .

it did n't go very well then , but it will be different at the world cup .
we will prepare ourselves better .
against poland we have to keep the ball flat , play good combinations , attack quickly and control the flanks .
that 's how we could make it hard for them . what about your third opponent in the preliminaries , costa rica ? we respect costa rica , as we do all of the other teams .
they will be at the world cup , because they earned it . how far will ecuador make it at the world cup ? it depends on how well we work .

i would be satisfied with that . how does your experience in the spanish league benefit ecuador 's national team ? the experience has helped me , us , very much .
the chance to play with people like riquelme in villareal or other soccer greats has made me more mature as a soccer player .
i 've learned a lot from it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valencia joined villereal last year your coach has always stressed that ecuador 's strength lays in the team 's closeness .
are you also so close off the soccer pitch ? the fact that we view ourselves as a compact unit is a great feeling , which is nothing new .
we 've felt this way for years .
it started with our former coach , dario gomez .
we learned from him how important our friendship is on and off the pitch .
coach suarez assumed this approach and carried on with it .
we stick together , that 's our capital . there 's one thing , however , that ecuador ca n't fall back on : international experience . now we will play in a world cup in which ecuador 's players can show their abilities .
there , one or two players will manage to make a step towards international soccer .
we will gain places in spanish or italian soccer clubs and lessen the lack of international experience . what can be expected of ecuador at the world cup ? personally , i have high expectations .
especially that the team does everything it can to represent our country with dignity - as we have done in the past . what do you think of your group opponent germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador sees germany as complicated we know germany is a complicated opponent whose game is very strong , fast and explosive .
we ecuadorians must be aware that we will play in a world cup and prepare for and complete the tournament appropriately .
we have to be able to draw on our best performance at the world cup , not just against germany . what do you think of the polish team ? we have played poland before .
it did n't go very well then , but it will be different at the world cup .
we will prepare ourselves better .
against poland we have to keep the ball flat , play good combinations , attack quickly and control the flanks .
that 's how we could make it hard for them . what about your third opponent in the preliminaries , costa rica ? we respect costa rica , as we do all of the other teams .
they will be at the world cup , because they earned it . how far will ecuador make it at the world cup ? it depends on how well we work .
if we continue playing as we have so far we will certainly make it quite far . do you have a message for ecuador 's fans ? you must continue to support us .
then you can expect great things from ecuador . daniel martinez interviewed antonio valencia -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de luis fernandez suarez : ecuador in the top eight luis fernando suarez enjoys a great deal of respect in latin america .
in an interview with dw-world.de , ecuador 's national coach seemed confident that his team would score international recognition at the world cup .
-lrb- may 4 , 2006 -rrb- world cup team checks : ecuador coming from south america , few people expected ecuador to make it to germany - considering the likes of brazil , argentina and uruguay .
but they made it to their second world cup finals .

" even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .
" we will never be able to prevent these incidents , but we need to raise the bar for potential copycat occurrences . " playing safe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts worry the fan mile migth be a troublespot according to current plans , the fan mile will be fenced in and monitored by surveillance cameras .
the entrances will be guarded by private security teams stopping anyone from taking bottles or potential weapons such as baseball bats onto the premises .
they will also be allowed - but not required - to search bags . safety will be even tighter over at the adidas arena in front of the reichstag and at the olympic stadium , with even sales-people , paramedics and sponsor representatives obliged to submit to criminal police office data checks . further safety concerns include excessive alcohol consumption , which berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting has proposed tackling with a formal restriction , and the risk of radical muslim terrorism , which has been described by interior minister wolfgang schäuble as the most serious threat . getting tough with juvenile offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence is on the rise but with experts agreeing that draconian safety precautions can not be maintained at all public events across the city , many believe the solution is deterrent measures such as the introduction of stricter sentencing for juvenile offenders - especially in the light of the recent increased incidence of youth crime and gang activities . " the minimum age for youth detention should be reduced -lrb- from 14 -rrb- to 12 , " argued martin linder from the liberal fdp .
" that does not mean that the priority is locking up young offenders but rather to take a remedial approach before they hit that slippery slope .
it 's about getting them back on the straight and narrow as early as possible . " ultimately , the real and present danger during the world cup is unlikely to originate with teenagers who 've had too much to drink or with terrorism .
recent weeks have seen rumors proliferate that hooligans are planning riots in areas such as the tiergarten park in central berlin . police say they are taking information like this very seriously , and have emphasized they are well-prepared to deal with hooligan violence . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

" in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .
germany has already pledged to have resolved the issue once and for all by 2009 . path strewn with obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants a god reference in the constitution it 's an ambitious goal , and may yet land berlin in hot water .
german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .
but no one can seriously believe that the european public will be fooled just by switching a label . plassnick , meanwhile , is no doubt looking forward to the day when she can pass the buck to her successor . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.05.2006 aviation treaty hoped to take flying to new heights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the aviation industry will take off once the treaty is implemented amid growing air traffic in europe 's skies , the eu has signed an agreement with southeast european nations to create a common aviation area .
it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .
the coal is burned in a steam chamber with pure oxygen .
the resulting smoke is cleaned , separated from the carbon dioxide and liquefied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant in hesse , germany however , this technology does have a few snags .
for one , efficiency suffers during the process .
traditional coal plants turn about 45 percent of the coal used into electricity .
with the oxyfuel process , around 35 percent of the coal becomes power .
the process is also not cheap and experts estimate the costs for separating and storing a ton of co2 at from 25 to 40 euros . storing the gas is also a challenge .
at present , gas and oil fields , coal seams and salt mines are under discussion . coal stocks healthy one of the biggest advantages of the new process is the availability of coal , stocks of which in germany should last for another century . " innovative technologies are needed especially in eastern germany , where coal is firmly anchored , " chancellor merkel said .
" but the significance of this process goes beyond brandenburg .
the future of generating electricity from coal is a concern for all of germany . " such words do not sit well with environmentalists , many of whom would like to reduce any dependence on fossil fuels .
on monday , protestors from the environmental group bund blew whistles and shouted slogans to stop using coal all together . but merkel said that the coal plant pilot project is attracting attention from abroad and that it , along with german know-how and technological innovation , could become a powerful export possibility .
but that could take some time .
if the technology works once the pilot plant is built , vattenfall wants to build a 300-megawatt facility by around 2015 .
estimates are that the technology could be commercially viable by around 2020 . sabine kinkartz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .

a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

" in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

" in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking .

it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?
besides wearing the flag , it is now also possible to paste it anywhere and everywhere with deutschband , a 66-meter -lrb- 217-feet -rrb- roll of packaging tape in tricolor horizontal stripes .
" this was our own personal project for the world cup , " said arne schultchen of feldmann + schultchen , whose industrial design clients include bacardi , europcar and microsoft . " the user is supposed to have fun with the tape , which is skin friendly and wo n't damage car paint .
being a designer with an awareness of branding , i wanted the flag colors to become a national brand , and seep into daily consciousness with 1001 creative uses , " said schultchen . but even the 40-year-old müller , who grew up in a generation that associated patriotism with the far right , admitted : " the only time i identify myself with being german is at the world cup .
if the german team makes it to the final , it will be a psychological boost for us , but i wo n't overestimate its importance in solving the budget deficit and unemployment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2006 opinion : re-opening a constitutional can of worms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula plassnik wants to see the eu functioning better the french and dutch rejection of the european constitution left the project in a state of acute temporary paralysis .
one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .
germany has already pledged to have resolved the issue once and for all by 2009 . path strewn with obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants a god reference in the constitution it 's an ambitious goal , and may yet land berlin in hot water .
german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .
but no one can seriously believe that the european public will be fooled just by switching a label . plassnick , meanwhile , is no doubt looking forward to the day when she can pass the buck to her successor . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?
besides wearing the flag , it is now also possible to paste it anywhere and everywhere with deutschband , a 66-meter -lrb- 217-feet -rrb- roll of packaging tape in tricolor horizontal stripes .
" this was our own personal project for the world cup , " said arne schultchen of feldmann + schultchen , whose industrial design clients include bacardi , europcar and microsoft . " the user is supposed to have fun with the tape , which is skin friendly and wo n't damage car paint .
being a designer with an awareness of branding , i wanted the flag colors to become a national brand , and seep into daily consciousness with 1001 creative uses , " said schultchen . but even the 40-year-old müller , who grew up in a generation that associated patriotism with the far right , admitted : " the only time i identify myself with being german is at the world cup .
if the german team makes it to the final , it will be a psychological boost for us , but i wo n't overestimate its importance in solving the budget deficit and unemployment .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany . " he plays football and likes the game , but i do n't know whether he will get the time to watch the games , " the spokesman replied when asked if ahmadinejad would be watching at home on television . waiting game over the news about the possibility of ahmadinejad supporting the iranian national team in person at the june 9-july 9 world cup finals raised some eyebrows , especially after the iranian president 's provocative interview for a prominent german weekly der spiegel .
in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles . ' jews should go back where they came from ' in his interview for der spiegel , ahmadinejad refused once again to acknowledge the holocaust . " i will only accept something as an absolute truth if i am fully convinced , " ahmadinejad said . " if the holocaust happened , then europe should suffer the consequences and not let palestine pay the price .
if nothing happened , then the jews should go back to where they came from . " he said five million palestinians have been " stateless " since the end of world war ii because of the creation of israel . " it is astonishing .
they have been paying for the holocaust for the past 60 years and they will do so still for another 100 years . " a notorious leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad also defends iran 's right to use nuclear energy .
here , the country 's bushehr nuclear plant ahmadinejad , who is notorious for his anti-semitic outbursts , said he believed it was wrong that modern-day germany should repent for what was done by the country 's former nazi rulers . " how long will this carry on ?
for how long will the german nation be the whipping boy of the zionists ? " he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish . " in the interview that turned into a rambling ideological debate with spiegel reporters , ahmadinejad insisted that iran 's controversial nuclear program was for peaceful purposes . " i insist again that we do not need nuclear weapons , we only want to avail ourselves of our rights .
we have not cheated anybody , " he said . europe - a big loser ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president will not be making new friends in germany this summer ahmadinejad said iran was against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and believed a neutral organization should be created to oversee global nuclear disarmament . he added that it was unjust that western nations that had nuclear weapons were trying to persuade tehran to give up parts of its nuclear program . " these countries strayed from having nuclear power merely for peaceful purposes .
they do not have the right to speak to us the way they do , " he said . he added that europe had made a mistake by siding with the us in the standoff over iran 's sensitive nuclear research , which washington believes is masking a nuclear weapons program . " europe will be the big loser , achieving nothing .
europe is losing its role in the middle east , and it is losing its influence in the rest of the world , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 preparing new incentives for iran while us talks tough the un security council 's five permanent members plus germany are to meet in london on may 19 to consider new incentives being prepared by european negotiators for iran to renounce its disputed nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2006 opinion : re-opening a constitutional can of worms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula plassnik wants to see the eu functioning better the french and dutch rejection of the european constitution left the project in a state of acute temporary paralysis .
one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .
germany has already pledged to have resolved the issue once and for all by 2009 . path strewn with obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants a god reference in the constitution it 's an ambitious goal , and may yet land berlin in hot water .
german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .
but no one can seriously believe that the european public will be fooled just by switching a label . plassnick , meanwhile , is no doubt looking forward to the day when she can pass the buck to her successor . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .

this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .
13 , but must be confirmed by düsseldorf authorities in june . a voyage to the land of political correctness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist alice schwarzer is defending the decision to honor peter handke journalist and feminist critic alice schwarzer , on the other hand , stood up in defense of the austrian writer and what she saw as handke 's courageous opposition to the political mainstream . " in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking .

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany . " he plays football and likes the game , but i do n't know whether he will get the time to watch the games , " the spokesman replied when asked if ahmadinejad would be watching at home on television . waiting game over the news about the possibility of ahmadinejad supporting the iranian national team in person at the june 9-july 9 world cup finals raised some eyebrows , especially after the iranian president 's provocative interview for a prominent german weekly der spiegel .
in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles . ' jews should go back where they came from ' in his interview for der spiegel , ahmadinejad refused once again to acknowledge the holocaust . " i will only accept something as an absolute truth if i am fully convinced , " ahmadinejad said . " if the holocaust happened , then europe should suffer the consequences and not let palestine pay the price .
if nothing happened , then the jews should go back to where they came from . " he said five million palestinians have been " stateless " since the end of world war ii because of the creation of israel . " it is astonishing .
they have been paying for the holocaust for the past 60 years and they will do so still for another 100 years . " a notorious leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad also defends iran 's right to use nuclear energy .
here , the country 's bushehr nuclear plant ahmadinejad , who is notorious for his anti-semitic outbursts , said he believed it was wrong that modern-day germany should repent for what was done by the country 's former nazi rulers . " how long will this carry on ?
for how long will the german nation be the whipping boy of the zionists ? " he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish . " in the interview that turned into a rambling ideological debate with spiegel reporters , ahmadinejad insisted that iran 's controversial nuclear program was for peaceful purposes . " i insist again that we do not need nuclear weapons , we only want to avail ourselves of our rights .
we have not cheated anybody , " he said . europe - a big loser ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president will not be making new friends in germany this summer ahmadinejad said iran was against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and believed a neutral organization should be created to oversee global nuclear disarmament . he added that it was unjust that western nations that had nuclear weapons were trying to persuade tehran to give up parts of its nuclear program .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

" in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking .

it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .

it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .
the coal is burned in a steam chamber with pure oxygen .
the resulting smoke is cleaned , separated from the carbon dioxide and liquefied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant in hesse , germany however , this technology does have a few snags .
for one , efficiency suffers during the process .
traditional coal plants turn about 45 percent of the coal used into electricity .
with the oxyfuel process , around 35 percent of the coal becomes power .
the process is also not cheap and experts estimate the costs for separating and storing a ton of co2 at from 25 to 40 euros . storing the gas is also a challenge .
at present , gas and oil fields , coal seams and salt mines are under discussion . coal stocks healthy one of the biggest advantages of the new process is the availability of coal , stocks of which in germany should last for another century . " innovative technologies are needed especially in eastern germany , where coal is firmly anchored , " chancellor merkel said .
" but the significance of this process goes beyond brandenburg .
the future of generating electricity from coal is a concern for all of germany . " such words do not sit well with environmentalists , many of whom would like to reduce any dependence on fossil fuels .
on monday , protestors from the environmental group bund blew whistles and shouted slogans to stop using coal all together . but merkel said that the coal plant pilot project is attracting attention from abroad and that it , along with german know-how and technological innovation , could become a powerful export possibility .
but that could take some time .
if the technology works once the pilot plant is built , vattenfall wants to build a 300-megawatt facility by around 2015 .
estimates are that the technology could be commercially viable by around 2020 . sabine kinkartz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

it did n't go very well then , but it will be different at the world cup .

they will be at the world cup , because they earned it . how far will ecuador make it at the world cup ? it depends on how well we work .

" speaking in berlin , cdu parliamentarian frank henkel stressed that the violent attack perpetrated was an isolated incident carried out by just one troubled individual , but conceded that 100 percent security simply can not be guaranteed . " even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .

there , one or two players will manage to make a step towards international soccer .
we will gain places in spanish or italian soccer clubs and lessen the lack of international experience . what can be expected of ecuador at the world cup ? personally , i have high expectations .
especially that the team does everything it can to represent our country with dignity - as we have done in the past . what do you think of your group opponent germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador sees germany as complicated we know germany is a complicated opponent whose game is very strong , fast and explosive .
we ecuadorians must be aware that we will play in a world cup and prepare for and complete the tournament appropriately .
we have to be able to draw on our best performance at the world cup , not just against germany . what do you think of the polish team ? we have played poland before .
it did n't go very well then , but it will be different at the world cup .
we will prepare ourselves better .
against poland we have to keep the ball flat , play good combinations , attack quickly and control the flanks .
that 's how we could make it hard for them . what about your third opponent in the preliminaries , costa rica ? we respect costa rica , as we do all of the other teams .
they will be at the world cup , because they earned it . how far will ecuador make it at the world cup ? it depends on how well we work .
if we continue playing as we have so far we will certainly make it quite far . do you have a message for ecuador 's fans ? you must continue to support us .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .

german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .
but no one can seriously believe that the european public will be fooled just by switching a label . plassnick , meanwhile , is no doubt looking forward to the day when she can pass the buck to her successor . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .
while an increase in the number of flights likely will translate into cheaper air alternatives in europe , it 's also expected to result in a positive ripple effect in the entire tourism sector . aida cama -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2006 iranian leader denies holocaust , drops plan to visit world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relentlessly unapologetic : iranian president ahmadinejad is known for his bombastic rhetoric iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has dropped plans to attend the world cup in germany .
this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany . " he plays football and likes the game , but i do n't know whether he will get the time to watch the games , " the spokesman replied when asked if ahmadinejad would be watching at home on television . waiting game over the news about the possibility of ahmadinejad supporting the iranian national team in person at the june 9-july 9 world cup finals raised some eyebrows , especially after the iranian president 's provocative interview for a prominent german weekly der spiegel .
in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles . ' jews should go back where they came from ' in his interview for der spiegel , ahmadinejad refused once again to acknowledge the holocaust . " i will only accept something as an absolute truth if i am fully convinced , " ahmadinejad said . " if the holocaust happened , then europe should suffer the consequences and not let palestine pay the price .
if nothing happened , then the jews should go back to where they came from . " he said five million palestinians have been " stateless " since the end of world war ii because of the creation of israel . " it is astonishing .
they have been paying for the holocaust for the past 60 years and they will do so still for another 100 years . " a notorious leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad also defends iran 's right to use nuclear energy .
here , the country 's bushehr nuclear plant ahmadinejad , who is notorious for his anti-semitic outbursts , said he believed it was wrong that modern-day germany should repent for what was done by the country 's former nazi rulers . " how long will this carry on ?
for how long will the german nation be the whipping boy of the zionists ? " he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish . " in the interview that turned into a rambling ideological debate with spiegel reporters , ahmadinejad insisted that iran 's controversial nuclear program was for peaceful purposes . " i insist again that we do not need nuclear weapons , we only want to avail ourselves of our rights .
we have not cheated anybody , " he said . europe - a big loser ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president will not be making new friends in germany this summer ahmadinejad said iran was against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and believed a neutral organization should be created to oversee global nuclear disarmament . he added that it was unjust that western nations that had nuclear weapons were trying to persuade tehran to give up parts of its nuclear program . " these countries strayed from having nuclear power merely for peaceful purposes .
they do not have the right to speak to us the way they do , " he said . he added that europe had made a mistake by siding with the us in the standoff over iran 's sensitive nuclear research , which washington believes is masking a nuclear weapons program .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany . " he plays football and likes the game , but i do n't know whether he will get the time to watch the games , " the spokesman replied when asked if ahmadinejad would be watching at home on television . waiting game over the news about the possibility of ahmadinejad supporting the iranian national team in person at the june 9-july 9 world cup finals raised some eyebrows , especially after the iranian president 's provocative interview for a prominent german weekly der spiegel .
in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles . ' jews should go back where they came from ' in his interview for der spiegel , ahmadinejad refused once again to acknowledge the holocaust . " i will only accept something as an absolute truth if i am fully convinced , " ahmadinejad said . " if the holocaust happened , then europe should suffer the consequences and not let palestine pay the price .
if nothing happened , then the jews should go back to where they came from . " he said five million palestinians have been " stateless " since the end of world war ii because of the creation of israel . " it is astonishing .

for how long will the german nation be the whipping boy of the zionists ? " he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish . " in the interview that turned into a rambling ideological debate with spiegel reporters , ahmadinejad insisted that iran 's controversial nuclear program was for peaceful purposes .

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .

with the oxyfuel process , around 35 percent of the coal becomes power .

the future of generating electricity from coal is a concern for all of germany . " such words do not sit well with environmentalists , many of whom would like to reduce any dependence on fossil fuels .
on monday , protestors from the environmental group bund blew whistles and shouted slogans to stop using coal all together . but merkel said that the coal plant pilot project is attracting attention from abroad and that it , along with german know-how and technological innovation , could become a powerful export possibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2006 teenage attacker triggers debate about world cup security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one act of violence can create mayhem a 16-year-old ran amok at the opening of berlin 's new central station saturday , sparking new doubts about safety during the imminent world cup and prompting politicians to call for a stricter response to youth crime . just weeks ahead of the world cup , a teenager 's injuring of 28 people at the opening celebrations for the capital 's new station saturday provided a chilling demonstration of just how easy it is to create havoc at public gatherings . but unlike the upcoming soccer bonanza , the event at the weekend took place without police controls - an omission described with hindsight by the weekly die welt newspaper as " foolish . " speaking in berlin , cdu parliamentarian frank henkel stressed that the violent attack perpetrated was an isolated incident carried out by just one troubled individual , but conceded that 100 percent security simply can not be guaranteed . " even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .
" we will never be able to prevent these incidents , but we need to raise the bar for potential copycat occurrences . " playing safe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts worry the fan mile migth be a troublespot according to current plans , the fan mile will be fenced in and monitored by surveillance cameras .
the entrances will be guarded by private security teams stopping anyone from taking bottles or potential weapons such as baseball bats onto the premises .
they will also be allowed - but not required - to search bags . safety will be even tighter over at the adidas arena in front of the reichstag and at the olympic stadium , with even sales-people , paramedics and sponsor representatives obliged to submit to criminal police office data checks . further safety concerns include excessive alcohol consumption , which berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting has proposed tackling with a formal restriction , and the risk of radical muslim terrorism , which has been described by interior minister wolfgang schäuble as the most serious threat . getting tough with juvenile offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence is on the rise but with experts agreeing that draconian safety precautions can not be maintained at all public events across the city , many believe the solution is deterrent measures such as the introduction of stricter sentencing for juvenile offenders - especially in the light of the recent increased incidence of youth crime and gang activities . " the minimum age for youth detention should be reduced -lrb- from 14 -rrb- to 12 , " argued martin linder from the liberal fdp .
" that does not mean that the priority is locking up young offenders but rather to take a remedial approach before they hit that slippery slope .
it 's about getting them back on the straight and narrow as early as possible . " ultimately , the real and present danger during the world cup is unlikely to originate with teenagers who 've had too much to drink or with terrorism .
recent weeks have seen rumors proliferate that hooligans are planning riots in areas such as the tiergarten park in central berlin . police say they are taking information like this very seriously , and have emphasized they are well-prepared to deal with hooligan violence . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .
while an increase in the number of flights likely will translate into cheaper air alternatives in europe , it 's also expected to result in a positive ripple effect in the entire tourism sector . aida cama -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

him saying something like that is huge motivation for me .
it animates me to work more and harder , to exert myself more every day .
the world cup is soccer 's biggest showcase . what do you have planned for the world cup ? i will do my best .
i wake up every day with the will to present myself in top form at the world cup .
i 'm training hard for it .
my goal is to show the world my talent . what do you want to achieve at the world cup ? above all , to ensure a fixed place in my club , villareal .
i would be satisfied with that . how does your experience in the spanish league benefit ecuador 's national team ? the experience has helped me , us , very much .
the chance to play with people like riquelme in villareal or other soccer greats has made me more mature as a soccer player .
i 've learned a lot from it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valencia joined villereal last year your coach has always stressed that ecuador 's strength lays in the team 's closeness .
are you also so close off the soccer pitch ? the fact that we view ourselves as a compact unit is a great feeling , which is nothing new .
we 've felt this way for years .
it started with our former coach , dario gomez .
we learned from him how important our friendship is on and off the pitch .
coach suarez assumed this approach and carried on with it .
we stick together , that 's our capital . there 's one thing , however , that ecuador ca n't fall back on : international experience . now we will play in a world cup in which ecuador 's players can show their abilities .
there , one or two players will manage to make a step towards international soccer .
we will gain places in spanish or italian soccer clubs and lessen the lack of international experience . what can be expected of ecuador at the world cup ? personally , i have high expectations .
especially that the team does everything it can to represent our country with dignity - as we have done in the past . what do you think of your group opponent germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador sees germany as complicated we know germany is a complicated opponent whose game is very strong , fast and explosive .
we ecuadorians must be aware that we will play in a world cup and prepare for and complete the tournament appropriately .
we have to be able to draw on our best performance at the world cup , not just against germany . what do you think of the polish team ? we have played poland before .
it did n't go very well then , but it will be different at the world cup .
we will prepare ourselves better .
against poland we have to keep the ball flat , play good combinations , attack quickly and control the flanks .
that 's how we could make it hard for them . what about your third opponent in the preliminaries , costa rica ? we respect costa rica , as we do all of the other teams .
they will be at the world cup , because they earned it . how far will ecuador make it at the world cup ? it depends on how well we work .
if we continue playing as we have so far we will certainly make it quite far . do you have a message for ecuador 's fans ? you must continue to support us .

it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?
besides wearing the flag , it is now also possible to paste it anywhere and everywhere with deutschband , a 66-meter -lrb- 217-feet -rrb- roll of packaging tape in tricolor horizontal stripes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2006 teenage attacker triggers debate about world cup security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one act of violence can create mayhem a 16-year-old ran amok at the opening of berlin 's new central station saturday , sparking new doubts about safety during the imminent world cup and prompting politicians to call for a stricter response to youth crime . just weeks ahead of the world cup , a teenager 's injuring of 28 people at the opening celebrations for the capital 's new station saturday provided a chilling demonstration of just how easy it is to create havoc at public gatherings . but unlike the upcoming soccer bonanza , the event at the weekend took place without police controls - an omission described with hindsight by the weekly die welt newspaper as " foolish . " speaking in berlin , cdu parliamentarian frank henkel stressed that the violent attack perpetrated was an isolated incident carried out by just one troubled individual , but conceded that 100 percent security simply can not be guaranteed . " even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .
" we will never be able to prevent these incidents , but we need to raise the bar for potential copycat occurrences . " playing safe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts worry the fan mile migth be a troublespot according to current plans , the fan mile will be fenced in and monitored by surveillance cameras .
the entrances will be guarded by private security teams stopping anyone from taking bottles or potential weapons such as baseball bats onto the premises .
they will also be allowed - but not required - to search bags . safety will be even tighter over at the adidas arena in front of the reichstag and at the olympic stadium , with even sales-people , paramedics and sponsor representatives obliged to submit to criminal police office data checks . further safety concerns include excessive alcohol consumption , which berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting has proposed tackling with a formal restriction , and the risk of radical muslim terrorism , which has been described by interior minister wolfgang schäuble as the most serious threat . getting tough with juvenile offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence is on the rise but with experts agreeing that draconian safety precautions can not be maintained at all public events across the city , many believe the solution is deterrent measures such as the introduction of stricter sentencing for juvenile offenders - especially in the light of the recent increased incidence of youth crime and gang activities . " the minimum age for youth detention should be reduced -lrb- from 14 -rrb- to 12 , " argued martin linder from the liberal fdp .
" that does not mean that the priority is locking up young offenders but rather to take a remedial approach before they hit that slippery slope .
it 's about getting them back on the straight and narrow as early as possible . " ultimately , the real and present danger during the world cup is unlikely to originate with teenagers who 've had too much to drink or with terrorism .
recent weeks have seen rumors proliferate that hooligans are planning riots in areas such as the tiergarten park in central berlin . police say they are taking information like this very seriously , and have emphasized they are well-prepared to deal with hooligan violence . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany .

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .
the coal is burned in a steam chamber with pure oxygen .
the resulting smoke is cleaned , separated from the carbon dioxide and liquefied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant in hesse , germany however , this technology does have a few snags .
for one , efficiency suffers during the process .
traditional coal plants turn about 45 percent of the coal used into electricity .
with the oxyfuel process , around 35 percent of the coal becomes power .
the process is also not cheap and experts estimate the costs for separating and storing a ton of co2 at from 25 to 40 euros . storing the gas is also a challenge .
at present , gas and oil fields , coal seams and salt mines are under discussion . coal stocks healthy one of the biggest advantages of the new process is the availability of coal , stocks of which in germany should last for another century . " innovative technologies are needed especially in eastern germany , where coal is firmly anchored , " chancellor merkel said .
" but the significance of this process goes beyond brandenburg .
the future of generating electricity from coal is a concern for all of germany . " such words do not sit well with environmentalists , many of whom would like to reduce any dependence on fossil fuels .
on monday , protestors from the environmental group bund blew whistles and shouted slogans to stop using coal all together . but merkel said that the coal plant pilot project is attracting attention from abroad and that it , along with german know-how and technological innovation , could become a powerful export possibility .
but that could take some time .
if the technology works once the pilot plant is built , vattenfall wants to build a 300-megawatt facility by around 2015 .
estimates are that the technology could be commercially viable by around 2020 . sabine kinkartz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .

" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?
besides wearing the flag , it is now also possible to paste it anywhere and everywhere with deutschband , a 66-meter -lrb- 217-feet -rrb- roll of packaging tape in tricolor horizontal stripes .
" this was our own personal project for the world cup , " said arne schultchen of feldmann + schultchen , whose industrial design clients include bacardi , europcar and microsoft . " the user is supposed to have fun with the tape , which is skin friendly and wo n't damage car paint .
being a designer with an awareness of branding , i wanted the flag colors to become a national brand , and seep into daily consciousness with 1001 creative uses , " said schultchen . but even the 40-year-old müller , who grew up in a generation that associated patriotism with the far right , admitted : " the only time i identify myself with being german is at the world cup .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .
while an increase in the number of flights likely will translate into cheaper air alternatives in europe , it 's also expected to result in a positive ripple effect in the entire tourism sector . aida cama -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .
while an increase in the number of flights likely will translate into cheaper air alternatives in europe , it 's also expected to result in a positive ripple effect in the entire tourism sector . aida cama -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution .

it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .

german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .

it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .
germany has already pledged to have resolved the issue once and for all by 2009 . path strewn with obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants a god reference in the constitution it 's an ambitious goal , and may yet land berlin in hot water .
german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .
but no one can seriously believe that the european public will be fooled just by switching a label . plassnick , meanwhile , is no doubt looking forward to the day when she can pass the buck to her successor . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

" in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking . " bozonnet 's decision was condemned in art circles in france , where handke lives , and by artists from further afield , including austrian nobel literature prize laureate elfriede jelinek . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed author handke awarded german literary prize controversial austrian playwright and novelist peter handke was awarded the city of düsseldorf 's heine prize for literature .

" even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .

just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .

traditional coal plants turn about 45 percent of the coal used into electricity .
with the oxyfuel process , around 35 percent of the coal becomes power .
the process is also not cheap and experts estimate the costs for separating and storing a ton of co2 at from 25 to 40 euros . storing the gas is also a challenge .
at present , gas and oil fields , coal seams and salt mines are under discussion . coal stocks healthy one of the biggest advantages of the new process is the availability of coal , stocks of which in germany should last for another century . " innovative technologies are needed especially in eastern germany , where coal is firmly anchored , " chancellor merkel said .
" but the significance of this process goes beyond brandenburg .
the future of generating electricity from coal is a concern for all of germany . " such words do not sit well with environmentalists , many of whom would like to reduce any dependence on fossil fuels .
on monday , protestors from the environmental group bund blew whistles and shouted slogans to stop using coal all together . but merkel said that the coal plant pilot project is attracting attention from abroad and that it , along with german know-how and technological innovation , could become a powerful export possibility .
but that could take some time .
if the technology works once the pilot plant is built , vattenfall wants to build a 300-megawatt facility by around 2015 .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .
while an increase in the number of flights likely will translate into cheaper air alternatives in europe , it 's also expected to result in a positive ripple effect in the entire tourism sector . aida cama -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .
while an increase in the number of flights likely will translate into cheaper air alternatives in europe , it 's also expected to result in a positive ripple effect in the entire tourism sector . aida cama -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .

german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .

this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god .

" speaking in berlin , cdu parliamentarian frank henkel stressed that the violent attack perpetrated was an isolated incident carried out by just one troubled individual , but conceded that 100 percent security simply can not be guaranteed . " even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .
" we will never be able to prevent these incidents , but we need to raise the bar for potential copycat occurrences . " playing safe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts worry the fan mile migth be a troublespot according to current plans , the fan mile will be fenced in and monitored by surveillance cameras .
the entrances will be guarded by private security teams stopping anyone from taking bottles or potential weapons such as baseball bats onto the premises .
they will also be allowed - but not required - to search bags . safety will be even tighter over at the adidas arena in front of the reichstag and at the olympic stadium , with even sales-people , paramedics and sponsor representatives obliged to submit to criminal police office data checks . further safety concerns include excessive alcohol consumption , which berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting has proposed tackling with a formal restriction , and the risk of radical muslim terrorism , which has been described by interior minister wolfgang schäuble as the most serious threat . getting tough with juvenile offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence is on the rise but with experts agreeing that draconian safety precautions can not be maintained at all public events across the city , many believe the solution is deterrent measures such as the introduction of stricter sentencing for juvenile offenders - especially in the light of the recent increased incidence of youth crime and gang activities . " the minimum age for youth detention should be reduced -lrb- from 14 -rrb- to 12 , " argued martin linder from the liberal fdp .
" that does not mean that the priority is locking up young offenders but rather to take a remedial approach before they hit that slippery slope .
it 's about getting them back on the straight and narrow as early as possible . " ultimately , the real and present danger during the world cup is unlikely to originate with teenagers who 've had too much to drink or with terrorism .
recent weeks have seen rumors proliferate that hooligans are planning riots in areas such as the tiergarten park in central berlin . police say they are taking information like this very seriously , and have emphasized they are well-prepared to deal with hooligan violence . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

dw-world.de spoke to the midfielder about his dreams and his expectations for the world cup . dw-world.de : when ecuador coach luis fernando suarez is asked which of his team 's players will play a decisive role at the world cup , he brings up your name . antonio valencia : seriously ?
him saying something like that is huge motivation for me .
it animates me to work more and harder , to exert myself more every day .
the world cup is soccer 's biggest showcase . what do you have planned for the world cup ? i will do my best .
i wake up every day with the will to present myself in top form at the world cup .
i 'm training hard for it .
my goal is to show the world my talent . what do you want to achieve at the world cup ? above all , to ensure a fixed place in my club , villareal .
i would be satisfied with that . how does your experience in the spanish league benefit ecuador 's national team ? the experience has helped me , us , very much .
the chance to play with people like riquelme in villareal or other soccer greats has made me more mature as a soccer player .
i 've learned a lot from it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valencia joined villereal last year your coach has always stressed that ecuador 's strength lays in the team 's closeness .
are you also so close off the soccer pitch ? the fact that we view ourselves as a compact unit is a great feeling , which is nothing new .
we 've felt this way for years .
it started with our former coach , dario gomez .
we learned from him how important our friendship is on and off the pitch .
coach suarez assumed this approach and carried on with it .
we stick together , that 's our capital . there 's one thing , however , that ecuador ca n't fall back on : international experience . now we will play in a world cup in which ecuador 's players can show their abilities .
there , one or two players will manage to make a step towards international soccer .
we will gain places in spanish or italian soccer clubs and lessen the lack of international experience . what can be expected of ecuador at the world cup ? personally , i have high expectations .
especially that the team does everything it can to represent our country with dignity - as we have done in the past . what do you think of your group opponent germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador sees germany as complicated we know germany is a complicated opponent whose game is very strong , fast and explosive .
we ecuadorians must be aware that we will play in a world cup and prepare for and complete the tournament appropriately .
we have to be able to draw on our best performance at the world cup , not just against germany . what do you think of the polish team ? we have played poland before .
it did n't go very well then , but it will be different at the world cup .
we will prepare ourselves better .
against poland we have to keep the ball flat , play good combinations , attack quickly and control the flanks .
that 's how we could make it hard for them . what about your third opponent in the preliminaries , costa rica ? we respect costa rica , as we do all of the other teams .
they will be at the world cup , because they earned it . how far will ecuador make it at the world cup ? it depends on how well we work .
if we continue playing as we have so far we will certainly make it quite far . do you have a message for ecuador 's fans ? you must continue to support us .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany . " he plays football and likes the game , but i do n't know whether he will get the time to watch the games , " the spokesman replied when asked if ahmadinejad would be watching at home on television . waiting game over the news about the possibility of ahmadinejad supporting the iranian national team in person at the june 9-july 9 world cup finals raised some eyebrows , especially after the iranian president 's provocative interview for a prominent german weekly der spiegel .
in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles . ' jews should go back where they came from ' in his interview for der spiegel , ahmadinejad refused once again to acknowledge the holocaust . " i will only accept something as an absolute truth if i am fully convinced , " ahmadinejad said . " if the holocaust happened , then europe should suffer the consequences and not let palestine pay the price .
if nothing happened , then the jews should go back to where they came from . " he said five million palestinians have been " stateless " since the end of world war ii because of the creation of israel . " it is astonishing .
they have been paying for the holocaust for the past 60 years and they will do so still for another 100 years . " a notorious leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad also defends iran 's right to use nuclear energy .
here , the country 's bushehr nuclear plant ahmadinejad , who is notorious for his anti-semitic outbursts , said he believed it was wrong that modern-day germany should repent for what was done by the country 's former nazi rulers . " how long will this carry on ?
for how long will the german nation be the whipping boy of the zionists ? " he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish . " in the interview that turned into a rambling ideological debate with spiegel reporters , ahmadinejad insisted that iran 's controversial nuclear program was for peaceful purposes .

we have not cheated anybody , " he said . europe - a big loser ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president will not be making new friends in germany this summer ahmadinejad said iran was against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and believed a neutral organization should be created to oversee global nuclear disarmament . he added that it was unjust that western nations that had nuclear weapons were trying to persuade tehran to give up parts of its nuclear program . " these countries strayed from having nuclear power merely for peaceful purposes .
they do not have the right to speak to us the way they do , " he said . he added that europe had made a mistake by siding with the us in the standoff over iran 's sensitive nuclear research , which washington believes is masking a nuclear weapons program .

" speaking in berlin , cdu parliamentarian frank henkel stressed that the violent attack perpetrated was an isolated incident carried out by just one troubled individual , but conceded that 100 percent security simply can not be guaranteed . " even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .
" we will never be able to prevent these incidents , but we need to raise the bar for potential copycat occurrences . " playing safe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts worry the fan mile migth be a troublespot according to current plans , the fan mile will be fenced in and monitored by surveillance cameras .
the entrances will be guarded by private security teams stopping anyone from taking bottles or potential weapons such as baseball bats onto the premises .
they will also be allowed - but not required - to search bags . safety will be even tighter over at the adidas arena in front of the reichstag and at the olympic stadium , with even sales-people , paramedics and sponsor representatives obliged to submit to criminal police office data checks . further safety concerns include excessive alcohol consumption , which berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting has proposed tackling with a formal restriction , and the risk of radical muslim terrorism , which has been described by interior minister wolfgang schäuble as the most serious threat . getting tough with juvenile offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence is on the rise but with experts agreeing that draconian safety precautions can not be maintained at all public events across the city , many believe the solution is deterrent measures such as the introduction of stricter sentencing for juvenile offenders - especially in the light of the recent increased incidence of youth crime and gang activities . " the minimum age for youth detention should be reduced -lrb- from 14 -rrb- to 12 , " argued martin linder from the liberal fdp .
" that does not mean that the priority is locking up young offenders but rather to take a remedial approach before they hit that slippery slope .
it 's about getting them back on the straight and narrow as early as possible . " ultimately , the real and present danger during the world cup is unlikely to originate with teenagers who 've had too much to drink or with terrorism .
recent weeks have seen rumors proliferate that hooligans are planning riots in areas such as the tiergarten park in central berlin . police say they are taking information like this very seriously , and have emphasized they are well-prepared to deal with hooligan violence . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany . " he plays football and likes the game , but i do n't know whether he will get the time to watch the games , " the spokesman replied when asked if ahmadinejad would be watching at home on television . waiting game over the news about the possibility of ahmadinejad supporting the iranian national team in person at the june 9-july 9 world cup finals raised some eyebrows , especially after the iranian president 's provocative interview for a prominent german weekly der spiegel .
in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles . ' jews should go back where they came from ' in his interview for der spiegel , ahmadinejad refused once again to acknowledge the holocaust . " i will only accept something as an absolute truth if i am fully convinced , " ahmadinejad said . " if the holocaust happened , then europe should suffer the consequences and not let palestine pay the price .
if nothing happened , then the jews should go back to where they came from . " he said five million palestinians have been " stateless " since the end of world war ii because of the creation of israel . " it is astonishing .
they have been paying for the holocaust for the past 60 years and they will do so still for another 100 years . " a notorious leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad also defends iran 's right to use nuclear energy .
here , the country 's bushehr nuclear plant ahmadinejad , who is notorious for his anti-semitic outbursts , said he believed it was wrong that modern-day germany should repent for what was done by the country 's former nazi rulers . " how long will this carry on ?
for how long will the german nation be the whipping boy of the zionists ? " he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish . " in the interview that turned into a rambling ideological debate with spiegel reporters , ahmadinejad insisted that iran 's controversial nuclear program was for peaceful purposes . " i insist again that we do not need nuclear weapons , we only want to avail ourselves of our rights .
we have not cheated anybody , " he said . europe - a big loser ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president will not be making new friends in germany this summer ahmadinejad said iran was against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and believed a neutral organization should be created to oversee global nuclear disarmament . he added that it was unjust that western nations that had nuclear weapons were trying to persuade tehran to give up parts of its nuclear program . " these countries strayed from having nuclear power merely for peaceful purposes .
they do not have the right to speak to us the way they do , " he said . he added that europe had made a mistake by siding with the us in the standoff over iran 's sensitive nuclear research , which washington believes is masking a nuclear weapons program .

it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?
besides wearing the flag , it is now also possible to paste it anywhere and everywhere with deutschband , a 66-meter -lrb- 217-feet -rrb- roll of packaging tape in tricolor horizontal stripes .
" this was our own personal project for the world cup , " said arne schultchen of feldmann + schultchen , whose industrial design clients include bacardi , europcar and microsoft . " the user is supposed to have fun with the tape , which is skin friendly and wo n't damage car paint .
being a designer with an awareness of branding , i wanted the flag colors to become a national brand , and seep into daily consciousness with 1001 creative uses , " said schultchen . but even the 40-year-old müller , who grew up in a generation that associated patriotism with the far right , admitted : " the only time i identify myself with being german is at the world cup .
if the german team makes it to the final , it will be a psychological boost for us , but i wo n't overestimate its importance in solving the budget deficit and unemployment .

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .
the coal is burned in a steam chamber with pure oxygen .
the resulting smoke is cleaned , separated from the carbon dioxide and liquefied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant in hesse , germany however , this technology does have a few snags .
for one , efficiency suffers during the process .
traditional coal plants turn about 45 percent of the coal used into electricity .
with the oxyfuel process , around 35 percent of the coal becomes power .
the process is also not cheap and experts estimate the costs for separating and storing a ton of co2 at from 25 to 40 euros . storing the gas is also a challenge .
at present , gas and oil fields , coal seams and salt mines are under discussion . coal stocks healthy one of the biggest advantages of the new process is the availability of coal , stocks of which in germany should last for another century . " innovative technologies are needed especially in eastern germany , where coal is firmly anchored , " chancellor merkel said .
" but the significance of this process goes beyond brandenburg .
the future of generating electricity from coal is a concern for all of germany . " such words do not sit well with environmentalists , many of whom would like to reduce any dependence on fossil fuels .
on monday , protestors from the environmental group bund blew whistles and shouted slogans to stop using coal all together . but merkel said that the coal plant pilot project is attracting attention from abroad and that it , along with german know-how and technological innovation , could become a powerful export possibility .
but that could take some time .
if the technology works once the pilot plant is built , vattenfall wants to build a 300-megawatt facility by around 2015 .
estimates are that the technology could be commercially viable by around 2020 . sabine kinkartz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2006 teenage attacker triggers debate about world cup security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one act of violence can create mayhem a 16-year-old ran amok at the opening of berlin 's new central station saturday , sparking new doubts about safety during the imminent world cup and prompting politicians to call for a stricter response to youth crime . just weeks ahead of the world cup , a teenager 's injuring of 28 people at the opening celebrations for the capital 's new station saturday provided a chilling demonstration of just how easy it is to create havoc at public gatherings . but unlike the upcoming soccer bonanza , the event at the weekend took place without police controls - an omission described with hindsight by the weekly die welt newspaper as " foolish . " speaking in berlin , cdu parliamentarian frank henkel stressed that the violent attack perpetrated was an isolated incident carried out by just one troubled individual , but conceded that 100 percent security simply can not be guaranteed . " even the most efficient security system can not prevent incidents like these , " he said , and warned against any over-hasty changes to existing security plans for the soccer games .
nonetheless , he proposed stepping up public controls in certain hotspots during major events such as the world cup , such as the " fan mile " which runs between the brandenburg gate and the victory column , and will be open every day from midday to midnight . " i believe it may well be necessary to rethink these areas to see if there might be other ways of intensifying our controls other than the random spot checks , " he said .
" we will never be able to prevent these incidents , but we need to raise the bar for potential copycat occurrences . " playing safe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts worry the fan mile migth be a troublespot according to current plans , the fan mile will be fenced in and monitored by surveillance cameras .
the entrances will be guarded by private security teams stopping anyone from taking bottles or potential weapons such as baseball bats onto the premises .
they will also be allowed - but not required - to search bags . safety will be even tighter over at the adidas arena in front of the reichstag and at the olympic stadium , with even sales-people , paramedics and sponsor representatives obliged to submit to criminal police office data checks . further safety concerns include excessive alcohol consumption , which berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting has proposed tackling with a formal restriction , and the risk of radical muslim terrorism , which has been described by interior minister wolfgang schäuble as the most serious threat . getting tough with juvenile offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence is on the rise but with experts agreeing that draconian safety precautions can not be maintained at all public events across the city , many believe the solution is deterrent measures such as the introduction of stricter sentencing for juvenile offenders - especially in the light of the recent increased incidence of youth crime and gang activities . " the minimum age for youth detention should be reduced -lrb- from 14 -rrb- to 12 , " argued martin linder from the liberal fdp .
" that does not mean that the priority is locking up young offenders but rather to take a remedial approach before they hit that slippery slope .
it 's about getting them back on the straight and narrow as early as possible . " ultimately , the real and present danger during the world cup is unlikely to originate with teenagers who 've had too much to drink or with terrorism .
recent weeks have seen rumors proliferate that hooligans are planning riots in areas such as the tiergarten park in central berlin . police say they are taking information like this very seriously , and have emphasized they are well-prepared to deal with hooligan violence . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .

" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2006 opinion : re-opening a constitutional can of worms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula plassnik wants to see the eu functioning better the french and dutch rejection of the european constitution left the project in a state of acute temporary paralysis .
one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .
germany has already pledged to have resolved the issue once and for all by 2009 . path strewn with obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants a god reference in the constitution it 's an ambitious goal , and may yet land berlin in hot water .
german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .
but no one can seriously believe that the european public will be fooled just by switching a label . plassnick , meanwhile , is no doubt looking forward to the day when she can pass the buck to her successor . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany . " he plays football and likes the game , but i do n't know whether he will get the time to watch the games , " the spokesman replied when asked if ahmadinejad would be watching at home on television . waiting game over the news about the possibility of ahmadinejad supporting the iranian national team in person at the june 9-july 9 world cup finals raised some eyebrows , especially after the iranian president 's provocative interview for a prominent german weekly der spiegel .
in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles . ' jews should go back where they came from ' in his interview for der spiegel , ahmadinejad refused once again to acknowledge the holocaust . " i will only accept something as an absolute truth if i am fully convinced , " ahmadinejad said . " if the holocaust happened , then europe should suffer the consequences and not let palestine pay the price .
if nothing happened , then the jews should go back to where they came from . " he said five million palestinians have been " stateless " since the end of world war ii because of the creation of israel . " it is astonishing .
they have been paying for the holocaust for the past 60 years and they will do so still for another 100 years . " a notorious leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad also defends iran 's right to use nuclear energy .
here , the country 's bushehr nuclear plant ahmadinejad , who is notorious for his anti-semitic outbursts , said he believed it was wrong that modern-day germany should repent for what was done by the country 's former nazi rulers . " how long will this carry on ?
for how long will the german nation be the whipping boy of the zionists ? " he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish . " in the interview that turned into a rambling ideological debate with spiegel reporters , ahmadinejad insisted that iran 's controversial nuclear program was for peaceful purposes . " i insist again that we do not need nuclear weapons , we only want to avail ourselves of our rights .
we have not cheated anybody , " he said . europe - a big loser ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president will not be making new friends in germany this summer ahmadinejad said iran was against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and believed a neutral organization should be created to oversee global nuclear disarmament . he added that it was unjust that western nations that had nuclear weapons were trying to persuade tehran to give up parts of its nuclear program . " these countries strayed from having nuclear power merely for peaceful purposes .
they do not have the right to speak to us the way they do , " he said . he added that europe had made a mistake by siding with the us in the standoff over iran 's sensitive nuclear research , which washington believes is masking a nuclear weapons program . " europe will be the big loser , achieving nothing .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany . " he plays football and likes the game , but i do n't know whether he will get the time to watch the games , " the spokesman replied when asked if ahmadinejad would be watching at home on television . waiting game over the news about the possibility of ahmadinejad supporting the iranian national team in person at the june 9-july 9 world cup finals raised some eyebrows , especially after the iranian president 's provocative interview for a prominent german weekly der spiegel .
in this interview , which was published on monday , ahmadinejad said he doubted the holocaust really happened , and repeated earlier calls for jews to leave israel and return to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has enraged the jewish community by denying that the holocaust took place reacting to ahmadinejad latest anti-semitic outburst , an international jewish human rights group had urged germany to keep ahmadinejad from attending the games " whether they say it publicly or privately , they should tell ahmadinejad that he is unwelcome to attend the world cup and that his presence there would be an affront to the millions of jews and non-jews who perished in the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles . ' jews should go back where they came from ' in his interview for der spiegel , ahmadinejad refused once again to acknowledge the holocaust . " i will only accept something as an absolute truth if i am fully convinced , " ahmadinejad said . " if the holocaust happened , then europe should suffer the consequences and not let palestine pay the price .
if nothing happened , then the jews should go back to where they came from . " he said five million palestinians have been " stateless " since the end of world war ii because of the creation of israel . " it is astonishing .
they have been paying for the holocaust for the past 60 years and they will do so still for another 100 years . " a notorious leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad also defends iran 's right to use nuclear energy .

for how long will the german nation be the whipping boy of the zionists ? " he asked . the iranian president has alternately called for the relocation and the destruction of the jewish state , warning on may 11 that israel will " one day vanish . " in the interview that turned into a rambling ideological debate with spiegel reporters , ahmadinejad insisted that iran 's controversial nuclear program was for peaceful purposes . " i insist again that we do not need nuclear weapons , we only want to avail ourselves of our rights .
we have not cheated anybody , " he said . europe - a big loser ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president will not be making new friends in germany this summer ahmadinejad said iran was against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and believed a neutral organization should be created to oversee global nuclear disarmament . he added that it was unjust that western nations that had nuclear weapons were trying to persuade tehran to give up parts of its nuclear program . " these countries strayed from having nuclear power merely for peaceful purposes .
they do not have the right to speak to us the way they do , " he said . he added that europe had made a mistake by siding with the us in the standoff over iran 's sensitive nuclear research , which washington believes is masking a nuclear weapons program .

this comes after he again denied the holocaust in an interview with a german magazine on monday . football-mad president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be travelling to germany to watch iran 's world cup clashes , his spokesman told afp monday . " no , he will not attend , " said government spokesman gholam hossein elham , putting an end to speculation that the hard-line president may be seeking to head to germany . " he plays football and likes the game , but i do n't know whether he will get the time to watch the games , " the spokesman replied when asked if ahmadinejad would be watching at home on television . waiting game over the news about the possibility of ahmadinejad supporting the iranian national team in person at the june 9-july 9 world cup finals raised some eyebrows , especially after the iranian president 's provocative interview for a prominent german weekly der spiegel .

" kuhn urged the city of düsseldorf , which sponsors the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , to overrule the decision by the jury who selected the winner . is it art ?
or is it politics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his artistic merit is not questioned , but his politics is : austrian writer peter handke the jury justified the award by saying that " in his work , peter handke obstinately follows the path to an open truth .
he sets his poetic gaze onto the world regardless of the public opinion and its rituals . " but the jury decision was not unanimous .
a member of the jury and former berlin culture senator from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , christoph stölz , openly distanced himself from handke . " handke was not my choice , " stölz said .
" i think what is happening now is good .
juries are not god . " joseph kruse , the head of the heinrich heine institute in düsseldorf , said he was torn over giving one of germany 's most prestigious literature awards to handke . handke has become " increasingly lost , " but at the same time it might be counter-productive to " treat him as though he has the plague , " kruse said . the prize is due to be awarded on dec .

" in a time of general demonization of serbia , he risked positioning himself against the one-sided allocation of blame , " schwarzer said . handke was named as the winner last week , a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays in response to his remarks at milosevic 's graveside . the administrator of the comédie-française , marcel bozonnet , said he was scandalized by handke 's eulogy and cancelled the 2007 season of " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution . "
and it 's just as well he thinks so , given that the tricky task of jumpstarting this stalled vision will be handed over to his country when germany takes over the hot seat from austria early next year . bitter debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of the referendums derailed the constitution project but so far , no solution to the constitutional crisis has even been suggested - although at least the c-word is no longer a dirty one among the bloc 's foreign ministers .
it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .
germany has already pledged to have resolved the issue once and for all by 2009 . path strewn with obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants a god reference in the constitution it 's an ambitious goal , and may yet land berlin in hot water .
german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .
but no one can seriously believe that the european public will be fooled just by switching a label . plassnick , meanwhile , is no doubt looking forward to the day when she can pass the buck to her successor . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

it is likely that the father of psychoanalysis would have regarded world cup soccer as therapeutic for a patient with an identity complex .
yes , that patient is germany , where guilt for nazi atrocities has been deeply imbedded in the collective psyche for six decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting the national colors " the idea of germany as a brand , as a nation , has always been a difficult one .
one can be wholeheartedly bavarian or swabian , european even , but not german .
the problem is that germany needs this national self-confidence to work its way out of an economic slump , " according to henrik müller , author of wirtschaftsfaktor patriotismus , a book which argues that patriotism is a key factor for success in a global economy . in the context of the world cup , however , exuberant flag-waving nationalism is not only acceptable , but encouraged .
as the 2006 host nation , germany even gets the chance to strut its national colors - black , red and gold - like a proud peacock before a global audience . black , red and gold all over ahead of the tournament , the horizontally-striped tricolor design has been featured prominently at airports , railway stations and window displays of shops everywhere .
mass market paraphernalia abounds in the form of beer mugs , umbrellas , beach towels , teddy bears , t-shirts , hats , caps and , of course , flags of all sizes . it seems one can not get enough of the german flag these days .
even designers who cringe at the word patriotism have jumped on the bandwagon to promote the black , red and gold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal eagle and tricolors as a fashion statement the official tricolor t-shirt selected for the " land of ideas " campaign , an initiative started by german president horst köhler and business leaders , is a hot seller , according to levon melikian , co-owner of the fashion firm eva gronbach gmbh .
" the demand has been enormous , beyond our expectations , " said melikan , who declined to reveal sales figures for the item . coming to terms with one 's national identity his design partner eva gronbach launched her fashion career in cologne a few years ago with her " declaration of love to germany " and " mother earth , fatherland " collections which bear the flag motif and a variation of the federal eagle . but first , gronbach had to battle her own personal demons and come to terms with what it means to be german , by living abroad along the eurostar corridor - brussels , paris and london - for six years . " i used to hate the colors of the flag , but now i find them feminine .
the flag represents positive values - freedom and democracy , " said gronbach , who emphasized that the multi-racial models wearing the cardigans , pullovers and accessories in the tricolor designs , reflect her vision of a tolerant and diverse germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will deutschband feature prominently on german suits ?
besides wearing the flag , it is now also possible to paste it anywhere and everywhere with deutschband , a 66-meter -lrb- 217-feet -rrb- roll of packaging tape in tricolor horizontal stripes .
" this was our own personal project for the world cup , " said arne schultchen of feldmann + schultchen , whose industrial design clients include bacardi , europcar and microsoft . " the user is supposed to have fun with the tape , which is skin friendly and wo n't damage car paint .
being a designer with an awareness of branding , i wanted the flag colors to become a national brand , and seep into daily consciousness with 1001 creative uses , " said schultchen . but even the 40-year-old müller , who grew up in a generation that associated patriotism with the far right , admitted : " the only time i identify myself with being german is at the world cup .
if the german team makes it to the final , it will be a psychological boost for us , but i wo n't overestimate its importance in solving the budget deficit and unemployment .

it aims to help both passengers and the aviation industry . the goal of the far-reaching treaty is to create a common aviation market for the eu and its neighboring countries by 2010 . the eu signed the agreement in early may this year with the transport ministries of eight southeast european partner countries to form a european common aviation area -lrb- ecaa -rrb- .
the treaty is expected to be officially approved by brussels on june 9 . a stepping stone to the eu experts are confident that the agreement will benefit both passengers and the aviation industry . " it 's better for both the industry and for the consumers if we have common rules and open up markets , " said johannes baur , who is responsible for aviation matters in the european commission .
if all goes according to plan , albania , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , macedonia , romania , serbia and montenegro and kosovo will be part of the ecaa by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro , which opted for independence last week , could also benefit " that means that these countries will find a link to the eu , " said baur .
" for example when it comes to keeping to the standards within the eu .
they will also be a part of the european market as complete and equal members . " ever since 2001 , air traffic between the eu and the eight southeastern european nations has increased sharply and continues to climb .
it 's expected to increase a further six percent per year in the coming years . bigger opportunities with rising competition despite the rapid growth of air traffic volume , ticket prices remain high .
for instance , passenger numbers from albania rose by 21 percent last year but the increase did n't result in lower air travel costs . agron nushaj , director of the department of transport policy at the albanian transport ministry , believes that opening up markets is still enormously important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germanwings too plans to fly to albania " when we open up the market , we give airlines the possibility of having a share in the european market without restrictions and as equal partners , " said nushaj .
" several different european airlines have offered to be operational in the albanian market .
in addition to the 13 airlines who fly from the only airport in the country , this year british airways and germanwings are coming to albania . " but nebojsa starcevic , deputy general director of the state-run serbian airline jat believes that discount airlines will not be flying to serbia for at least a year because they do n't really sense an economic opportunity there .
jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .
while an increase in the number of flights likely will translate into cheaper air alternatives in europe , it 's also expected to result in a positive ripple effect in the entire tourism sector . aida cama -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

jat wants to dominate the southeastern european market and try to unseat the leader at present , hungarian airlines malev , by offering cheaper tickets . the european commission 's bauer , however , believes that the ecaa agreement also offers big opportunities for businesses in the southeastern countries . " it 's true that it will lead to stronger competition , " baur said .
" but the aviation companies in the countries of southeastern europe have the advantage of knowing these markets really well .
so if they prepare well for the opening of the markets , they then will have a good chance of profiting from the agreement and eventually be able to compete in the future in alliance with big european airlines such as air france or lufthansa . " good news for tourism it 's not just individual aviation companies that stand to benefit from the single-skies agreement . the eu 's eastward expansion in 2004 has shown the positive effects that the entry of ten new members into the bloc has brought for both consumers as well as airlines .
while an increase in the number of flights likely will translate into cheaper air alternatives in europe , it 's also expected to result in a positive ripple effect in the entire tourism sector . aida cama -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees common airspace with neighboring states the european union on friday signed an agreement with nine countries , as well as the un mission in kosovo , to create a common aviation area in a move hailed as boosting european economic and commercial integration .

one year on , it seems to have found a second wind .
dw 's bernd riegert on the new optimism . " the constitution project is a european project , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , as a meeting of eu foreign ministers came to an end in vienna at the weekend .
the talks held in a 900-year-old austrian abbey centered around ways of making europe function better , with the general consensus appearing to be that the constitution is a key part of the process . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , for one , stressed that " there is absolutely no reason to give up the constitution .

it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .

it does n't seem so long ago that the french and the dutch were resolutely refusing to discuss this thorny issue after the shock results of their referendums last year . but plassnik , with her iron fist in a velvet glove , has managed to get even the killjoys back at the table together to discuss the project 's future . germany in the hot seat but while the mood may be more optimistic , the actual results of the weekend 's meeting are on the scanty side . everyone agrees that the bloc needs to extend the " period of reflection " launched in june 2005 for another year , allowing for more time to mull which direction it should take and only then take a new look at the constitution .
the key challenge will be extracting a " yes " from the recalcitrant parties without changing the text so painstakingly fleshed out by 15 states , while another option would be convincing these 15 states that a reworking a few clauses might not be such a bad idea after all . but for the time being , frank-walter steinmeier does n't have any answers .
he 'll have to have come up with a few by summer 2007 , when it will be his turn to try ushering the eu out of its cul-de-sac .
germany has already pledged to have resolved the issue once and for all by 2009 . path strewn with obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants a god reference in the constitution it 's an ambitious goal , and may yet land berlin in hot water .
german chancellor angela merkel 's demand that the constitution include a reference to god and christian belief will complicate her foreign minister 's job even further .
this dimension to the debate had in fact been considered down and dusted , given that france made it clear it would never agree .
by bringing the matter up again , merkel is opening a whole new can of worms . other steps forward have also been thwarted .
eu commission president jose barrosos 's suggestion that certain parts of the constitution could be adopted separately , " by stealth , " as it were , has been put on ice , while germany is reluctant to see more national responsibility handed over to brussels . some foreign ministers proposed changing the name of the constitution without actually changing a word in the document .
but no one can seriously believe that the european public will be fooled just by switching a label . plassnick , meanwhile , is no doubt looking forward to the day when she can pass the buck to her successor . bernd riegert -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

on monday in eastern germany , ground was broken on a coal-fired plant that will emit no greenhouse gases . with a turn of earth , german chancellor angela merkel and the heads of the swedish energy giant vattenfall inaugurated the construction site for the world 's first co2-free coal-fired power plant , scheduled to go into operation in 2008 . for vattenfall , which has invested 50 million euros -lrb- $ million -rrb- in the facility , the plant will be a door to a future that is increasingly under threat from global warming , which is thought to be caused by emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the plant is to be located near the border between the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony , where the energy heart of the former east germany once beat .
but the large plant which once provided the communist state its energy is but a shell now .
just next door , however , vattenfall hopes to write " coal history , " according to its ceo lars joseffson . " this investment in a new technology should pave the way and be a model of high-tech power generation on the basis of coal , " he said .
" it will be a plant with high efficiency and the latest in environmental technology . " cleaning and separating the process by which clean energy is produced from coal is called oxyfuel .
the coal is burned in a steam chamber with pure oxygen .
the resulting smoke is cleaned , separated from the carbon dioxide and liquefied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant in hesse , germany however , this technology does have a few snags .
for one , efficiency suffers during the process .
traditional coal plants turn about 45 percent of the coal used into electricity .
with the oxyfuel process , around 35 percent of the coal becomes power .
the process is also not cheap and experts estimate the costs for separating and storing a ton of co2 at from 25 to 40 euros . storing the gas is also a challenge .
at present , gas and oil fields , coal seams and salt mines are under discussion . coal stocks healthy one of the biggest advantages of the new process is the availability of coal , stocks of which in germany should last for another century . " innovative technologies are needed especially in eastern germany , where coal is firmly anchored , " chancellor merkel said .
" but the significance of this process goes beyond brandenburg .
the future of generating electricity from coal is a concern for all of germany . " such words do not sit well with environmentalists , many of whom would like to reduce any dependence on fossil fuels .
on monday , protestors from the environmental group bund blew whistles and shouted slogans to stop using coal all together . but merkel said that the coal plant pilot project is attracting attention from abroad and that it , along with german know-how and technological innovation , could become a powerful export possibility .
but that could take some time .
if the technology works once the pilot plant is built , vattenfall wants to build a 300-megawatt facility by around 2015 .
estimates are that the technology could be commercially viable by around 2020 . sabine kinkartz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

show time the net does offer ways to offset the cost of using it by making a little money on the side , but it can involve either a lot of luck or a lot of work .
luck is the hardest one to court but help could be at hand if you have a video to showcase thanks to revver .

the revver site , like rivals youtube and many others , aims to exploit the word-of-mouth effect by making it easy to upload video and get it passed around among the net 's ever-growing audience .

among other things he wants the revver site to become a forum for novice film makers to give them an audience for their creations that they would struggle to reach .
" i believe we are going to see really interesting creativity coming from very disparate places , " he said .
adverts are tagged on to the end of every clip and any money made is shared with the creator .
creators can also choose what type of advertising they want to run after their movie .
for instance , some may not want to take cash from tobacco firms .
using advertising to fund distribution of a film can make a huge difference , said mr starr citing the example of the hugely popular animated parody of woody guthrie 's " this land " that lampooned george bush and presidential hopeful john kerry .
the short film was downloaded millions of times and cartoon creator jibjab was reportedly landed with a bandwidth bill of more than $ 100,000 .

you pay good money for your computer , for net access , for domains you own and places to host them .
if you play an online game regularly or have a busy blog , you might pay for that too .
to make matters worse , others make money from your browsing habits and e-mail conversations which are used to generate adverts you might find interesting .
sometimes the websites you use are bought for huge sums of money that are never shared with the community which made that site ripe for acquisition in the first place .
show time the net does offer ways to offset the cost of using it by making a little money on the side , but it can involve either a lot of luck or a lot of work .
luck is the hardest one to court but help could be at hand if you have a video to showcase thanks to revver .
founded by movie and grassroots film veteran steven starr the site aims to be a showcase for video creators and will share any cash generated by adverts tagged on the end of any uploaded clips .
the revver site , like rivals youtube and many others , aims to exploit the word-of-mouth effect by making it easy to upload video and get it passed around among the net 's ever-growing audience .

" i believe we are going to see really interesting creativity coming from very disparate places , " he said .
adverts are tagged on to the end of every clip and any money made is shared with the creator .
creators can also choose what type of advertising they want to run after their movie .
for instance , some may not want to take cash from tobacco firms .
using advertising to fund distribution of a film can make a huge difference , said mr starr citing the example of the hugely popular animated parody of woody guthrie 's " this land " that lampooned george bush and presidential hopeful john kerry .
the short film was downloaded millions of times and cartoon creator jibjab was reportedly landed with a bandwidth bill of more than $ 100,000 .

you pay good money for your computer , for net access , for domains you own and places to host them .
if you play an online game regularly or have a busy blog , you might pay for that too .
to make matters worse , others make money from your browsing habits and e-mail conversations which are used to generate adverts you might find interesting .
sometimes the websites you use are bought for huge sums of money that are never shared with the community which made that site ripe for acquisition in the first place .
show time the net does offer ways to offset the cost of using it by making a little money on the side , but it can involve either a lot of luck or a lot of work .
luck is the hardest one to court but help could be at hand if you have a video to showcase thanks to revver .
founded by movie and grassroots film veteran steven starr the site aims to be a showcase for video creators and will share any cash generated by adverts tagged on the end of any uploaded clips .
the revver site , like rivals youtube and many others , aims to exploit the word-of-mouth effect by making it easy to upload video and get it passed around among the net 's ever-growing audience .
the jibjab us election parody cost its maker a lot to put online " i 'm deeply aware of how hard it is for creators to get their content seen by professional distribution operators , " mr starr told the bbc news website .
among other things he wants the revver site to become a forum for novice film makers to give them an audience for their creations that they would struggle to reach .
" i believe we are going to see really interesting creativity coming from very disparate places , " he said .
adverts are tagged on to the end of every clip and any money made is shared with the creator .
creators can also choose what type of advertising they want to run after their movie .
for instance , some may not want to take cash from tobacco firms .
using advertising to fund distribution of a film can make a huge difference , said mr starr citing the example of the hugely popular animated parody of woody guthrie 's " this land " that lampooned george bush and presidential hopeful john kerry .
the short film was downloaded millions of times and cartoon creator jibjab was reportedly landed with a bandwidth bill of more than $ 100,000 .
via revver that loss could have been turned into a big profit , said mr starr .
lucky break many big community sites , such as myspace , have a thriving economy attached to them of people that know the system inside out .
they make money selling little software utilities they have created to automate common tasks .
paul mutton 's site has proved popular with many amateur snappers others produce guides to help people customise the blog space they get when they sign up for myspace and many money from the adverts shown on the website hosting the information .
for many who maintain a blog or their own website , adverts served on their pages can be a very easy way to generate a little cash .
one of the easiest ways to do this is by signing up to google 's adsense program .
this analyses what you are writing about on your site and serves up small ads that are relevant to that subject .
when people click on those adverts you get a share of what was paid to google to place the ad .
a lot of people have signed up for adsense .
but google has a policy of not saying what the average return is from it but a website has to be very popular to generate a reasonable return .
only a lucky few websites win a big enough audience to generate the ad clicks and it can often be hard to work out why some sites are popular .
amateur photographer paul mutton set up a site that offers downloadable , printable blueprints for paper lens hoods for a variety of digital and slr cameras .
lens hoods might seem a bit esoteric but interest in the site has grown virally said mr mutton after he told some friends about it on net chat channels .
" before i knew it , word had spread worldwide across hundreds of internet photography forums and aggregation sites like del.icio.us and metafilter , " he said .
although unwilling to say how much he is making from the site , he said that in the first two months of its operation he had made enough money to pay for the spare time he spent putting it together and to cover his bandwidth costs .

and that , say his supporters , is in itself proof that alvaro uribe is the man to lead the country over the next four years and tackle the one problem that is - and has been for the past 40 years - uppermost in most colombian minds : violence .
when he first took office four years ago , mr uribe said he would solve the problem .
a problem that has seen something like 200,000 deaths in four decades of violence .
in 2002 alone , there were 36,000 murders .
left-wing rebels , right-wing militia and heavily armed cocaine-producing gangs treat large areas of the country as their own personal fiefdoms , leaving death and destruction in their wake .
most of the victims are innocent civilians .
hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes .
a huge armed police and army presence on the streets of colombia 's cities has made them much safer . "
we 're on the right road to solve our problems " alfredo rangel , foundation for security and democracy there has been a drop in the number of murders - 15,000 last year .
official figures say that the government disarmed and disbanded 26,000 right-wing militia last year .
and , with the help of billions of dollars from the united states , a huge campaign is underway to eliminate the coca leaf crop from which cocaine is made .
long way to go despite these advances , colombia is still one of the most dangerous countries in the world .
not everyone is convinced that the right-wing militia have stopped operating .
the cocaine industry is still thriving .
on election day , police uncovered two tonnes of the drug about to be shipped abroad .
but talk to people on the streets of bogota and they are convinced that life is more peaceful and that alvaro uribe is the man to thank for it .
horacio , a taxi driver , said : " this is a great city and uribe has been a great president , really fantastic . "
alfredo rangel , an analyst from the foundation for security and democracy , said : " we 're on the right road to solve our problems .
" i think all the factors , all the elements , are there to justify optimism in the medium and long term .
in the short term , we probably will see more violence when , after the elections , the guerrillas will want to demonstrate their military strength . "
the defence minister , camilo ospina bernal , oversaw the deployment of 220,000 police and soldiers around colombia on polling day .
in a rare interview , he told the bbc that the security forces now had control of all colombian territory .
" we can go everywhere , " he said .
" there may be places where the terrorists , more or less , have a presence .
but all national territory is under the control of the military .
there 's nowhere that military forces ca n't go . "
some may be surprised by that statement .
the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , or farc , boast something like 18,000 members .
the smaller national liberation army , or eln , also has an impact .
the defence minister said the rebel groups nowadays boasted little in the way of ideology but were financed by kidnapping and the drug trade .
drugs fight the united states has given $ 4.5bn over the past few years to finance plan colombia , equipping the colombian security forces to eliminate the coca crop and fight the drugs gangs .
despite some high-profile arrests and the destruction of millions of hectares of coca leaf plantations , the supply of cocaine to european and north american markets remains at levels similar to those of a few years ago .
the illegal trade is so lucrative that there are always plenty of young ' narcos ' waiting to fill the shoes of the bosses that are arrested and extradited to the united states .
but no one is more convinced than alvaro uribe himself that he is the man for the job , to implement what he calls " democratic security " .
the constitution was altered to allow him to run for a second term in office and there are rumours that he might even try for a third .
the economy is doing well .
but after the violence , the new government will have to deal with poor wealth distribution and growing poverty .
the government view , however , is that cocaine and the violence it engenders is at the root of nearly all of colombia 's other problems .
mr uribe 's victory will be welcomed in washington which has few allies in latin america .
president bush has seen growing anti-us feelings expressed in bolivia and venezuela and to a lesser degree in ecuador and peru .
but he has a firm friend in harvard-educated mr uribe .
the election campaign was muted and many people did not vote .
but expectations are high that president alvaro uribe , whose father was killed by rebels in a botched kidnap attempt , can reduce the violence that colombia has suffered for so many years .
he is said to be a workaholic , which may be a useful trait given the task that lies ahead .

china : rupert wingfield-hayes , beijing officially china does not censor the internet .
according to the chinese government , its internet regulation is no different from that in america , britain , or anywhere else in the world .
china says it only blocks internet sites that are damaging , such as pornographic sites , or ones promoting things like terrorism .
the reality of china 's internet is very different .
just try logging on to the bbc news website from an internet cafe in china .
you ca n't .

china probably has the most sophisticated internet monitoring and censorship system in the world .

some large , us-based computer software companies are believed to have sold beijing the sophisticated software needed to run its filtering system .
companies like google and yahoo ! have also been accused of co-operating in china 's internet censorship .
google , for example , has modified its chinese language search engine so that it does not show results for sites the chinese government deems " harmful " .
inside china there is an even larger effort to control the country 's own internet .
internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- are required by law to monitor their own websites and chat-rooms for " dangerous content " .

on top of that government employs thousands more who constantly scan the chinese web , closing down any site or blog that is considered subversive .
for those chinese who persist in using the internet to criticize communist party rule , the end result can be a prison cell .
three young men were recently sentenced to prison terms of eight to ten years for using the internet to send " sensitive " information to foreign based websites .
cuba : stephen gibbs , havana cuba has vowed to be a force to be reckoned with in the digital era .
thousands of cubans are being trained in a new school for computer technology on the outskirts of havana .
free computer clubs have been set up across the country .
even the smallest rural schools are being provided with their own terminals .
but at the same time the government is working hard to prevent its citizens from surfing the net without restraint .
shops in havana might appear to sell high-quality computers , but actually making a purchase is impossible for cubans without special approval , which is rarely granted .
similar restrictions are in place for anyone who might want to open up an account with the state internet service provider .
exceptions include senior government officials , academic researchers , and foreigners .
the authorities say these regulations are in place in order to ensure the internet in cuba is used for " social and collective use . "
' prioritising ' although all cuban media is rigorously state controlled , the government rejects accusations that it is censoring the net .
it concedes that some sites are blocked , but say these are " terrorist , xenophobic , or pornographic " .
websites based in the us which publish articles by dissidents from within cuba are generally inaccessible .
the government says that what it is doing is " prioritising " the internet , for use by sectors such as education and health .
essential , it says , given cuba 's limited resources , and limited bandwidth .
the bandwidth problem is blamed on the united states .
as a result of the us trade embargo , cuba can not link up to the web via a direct fibre optic line .
instead it has to use more expensive satellite links .
thousands of cubans get around their governments restrictions and access the internet via the black market .
user ids and passwords are sold by state employees whose jobs give them legal access .
some log on via home made computers built from smuggled parts .
a legal alternative is to go to one of the cyber cafes that are being set up across the country .
but these have another barrier - cost .
half an hour surfing the web costs around $ 3 .
that might be comparable to the price in other parts of the world , but in cuba , where the average salary is $ 15 a month , it is substantial .
united arab emirates : julia wheeler , dubai in the united arab emirates , internet censorship centres on two distinct areas ; pornography and the criticism of gulf governments .
while the majority of the multi-national population welcomes the blocking of pornography sites , the same can not be said for the more politically motivated cases .
from the uae , attempting to access sites like www.uaeprison.com or www.arabtimes.com -lrb- published in the united states -rrb- brings up an apology for the site being blocked and an explanation ; it is " due to its content being inconsistent with the religious , cultural , political and moral values of the united arab emirates . "
it is not clear how the monopoly internet provider , etisilat , determines what contravenes the country 's values .
there is a right of reply on any blocked site message though , allowing surfers to suggest it be made accessible .
for many , the censorship of sites which question , discuss or oppose the ruling families of the gulf states and their absolute power , is anachronistic .
the uae is one of the fastest developing countries in the world , but this development is far more economic than political .
satirical blogs , parodying the city and its residents , such as secretdubai.blogspot.com , www.dubaienquirer.com and onebigconstructionsite.blogspot.com can be found .
internet users in dubai 's commercial free zones - like dubai internet city , dubai media city and knowledge village - are able to sidestep the strict state censorship by using a different proxy .
the more technically savvy users in other parts of the country are also finding ways to access the banned sites they want to view .
in march , there were reports internet cafe users could have their personal details recorded and kept on file .
the explanation from the authorities was that this was to curb " cyber crime " including hacking and sending spam emails , but it has brought into focus questions of personal privacy .
the opening-up of the telecoms sector which is due to allow another state-run company , du , to operate from later this year is unlikely to change the position on blocked sites .
perhaps one of the biggest annoyances for the mostly expatriate population in the emirates is the inaccessibility of internet telephony sites like www.skype.com.
this is widely seen as economic censorship ; the state wanting to ensure continuing large profits through migrant workers making international telephone calls .

google , for example , has modified its chinese language search engine so that it does not show results for sites the chinese government deems " harmful " .
inside china there is an even larger effort to control the country 's own internet .
internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- are required by law to monitor their own websites and chat-rooms for " dangerous content " .
every isp in china has its own staff of " web police " .
on top of that government employs thousands more who constantly scan the chinese web , closing down any site or blog that is considered subversive .
for those chinese who persist in using the internet to criticize communist party rule , the end result can be a prison cell .
three young men were recently sentenced to prison terms of eight to ten years for using the internet to send " sensitive " information to foreign based websites .
cuba : stephen gibbs , havana cuba has vowed to be a force to be reckoned with in the digital era .
thousands of cubans are being trained in a new school for computer technology on the outskirts of havana .
free computer clubs have been set up across the country .
even the smallest rural schools are being provided with their own terminals .
cuba 's licensed internet terminals are meant only for tourists but at the same time the government is working hard to prevent its citizens from surfing the net without restraint .
shops in havana might appear to sell high-quality computers , but actually making a purchase is impossible for cubans without special approval , which is rarely granted .
similar restrictions are in place for anyone who might want to open up an account with the state internet service provider .
exceptions include senior government officials , academic researchers , and foreigners .
the authorities say these regulations are in place in order to ensure the internet in cuba is used for " social and collective use . "
' prioritising ' although all cuban media is rigorously state controlled , the government rejects accusations that it is censoring the net .
it concedes that some sites are blocked , but say these are " terrorist , xenophobic , or pornographic " .
websites based in the us which publish articles by dissidents from within cuba are generally inaccessible .
the government says that what it is doing is " prioritising " the internet , for use by sectors such as education and health .
essential , it says , given cuba 's limited resources , and limited bandwidth .
the bandwidth problem is blamed on the united states .
as a result of the us trade embargo , cuba can not link up to the web via a direct fibre optic line .
instead it has to use more expensive satellite links .
thousands of cubans get around their governments restrictions and access the internet via the black market .
user ids and passwords are sold by state employees whose jobs give them legal access .
some log on via home made computers built from smuggled parts .
a legal alternative is to go to one of the cyber cafes that are being set up across the country .
but these have another barrier - cost .
half an hour surfing the web costs around $ 3 .
that might be comparable to the price in other parts of the world , but in cuba , where the average salary is $ 15 a month , it is substantial .
united arab emirates : julia wheeler , dubai in the united arab emirates , internet censorship centres on two distinct areas ; pornography and the criticism of gulf governments .
while the majority of the multi-national population welcomes the blocking of pornography sites , the same can not be said for the more politically motivated cases .
the uae is one of the fastest developing countries in the world from the uae , attempting to access sites like www.uaeprison.com or www.arabtimes.com -lrb- published in the united states -rrb- brings up an apology for the site being blocked and an explanation ; it is " due to its content being inconsistent with the religious , cultural , political and moral values of the united arab emirates . "
it is not clear how the monopoly internet provider , etisilat , determines what contravenes the country 's values .
there is a right of reply on any blocked site message though , allowing surfers to suggest it be made accessible .
for many , the censorship of sites which question , discuss or oppose the ruling families of the gulf states and their absolute power , is anachronistic .
the uae is one of the fastest developing countries in the world , but this development is far more economic than political .
satirical blogs , parodying the city and its residents , such as secretdubai.blogspot.com , www.dubaienquirer.com and onebigconstructionsite.blogspot.com can be found .
internet users in dubai 's commercial free zones - like dubai internet city , dubai media city and knowledge village - are able to sidestep the strict state censorship by using a different proxy .

in march , there were reports internet cafe users could have their personal details recorded and kept on file .
the explanation from the authorities was that this was to curb " cyber crime " including hacking and sending spam emails , but it has brought into focus questions of personal privacy .
the opening-up of the telecoms sector which is due to allow another state-run company , du , to operate from later this year is unlikely to change the position on blocked sites .
perhaps one of the biggest annoyances for the mostly expatriate population in the emirates is the inaccessibility of internet telephony sites like www.skype.com.
this is widely seen as economic censorship ; the state wanting to ensure continuing large profits through migrant workers making international telephone calls .

free computer clubs have been set up across the country .
even the smallest rural schools are being provided with their own terminals .
cuba 's licensed internet terminals are meant only for tourists but at the same time the government is working hard to prevent its citizens from surfing the net without restraint .
shops in havana might appear to sell high-quality computers , but actually making a purchase is impossible for cubans without special approval , which is rarely granted .
similar restrictions are in place for anyone who might want to open up an account with the state internet service provider .
exceptions include senior government officials , academic researchers , and foreigners .
the authorities say these regulations are in place in order to ensure the internet in cuba is used for " social and collective use . "
' prioritising ' although all cuban media is rigorously state controlled , the government rejects accusations that it is censoring the net .
it concedes that some sites are blocked , but say these are " terrorist , xenophobic , or pornographic " .
websites based in the us which publish articles by dissidents from within cuba are generally inaccessible .
the government says that what it is doing is " prioritising " the internet , for use by sectors such as education and health .
essential , it says , given cuba 's limited resources , and limited bandwidth .
the bandwidth problem is blamed on the united states .
as a result of the us trade embargo , cuba can not link up to the web via a direct fibre optic line .
instead it has to use more expensive satellite links .
thousands of cubans get around their governments restrictions and access the internet via the black market .
user ids and passwords are sold by state employees whose jobs give them legal access .
some log on via home made computers built from smuggled parts .
a legal alternative is to go to one of the cyber cafes that are being set up across the country .
but these have another barrier - cost .
half an hour surfing the web costs around $ 3 .
that might be comparable to the price in other parts of the world , but in cuba , where the average salary is $ 15 a month , it is substantial .
united arab emirates : julia wheeler , dubai in the united arab emirates , internet censorship centres on two distinct areas ; pornography and the criticism of gulf governments .
while the majority of the multi-national population welcomes the blocking of pornography sites , the same can not be said for the more politically motivated cases .
the uae is one of the fastest developing countries in the world from the uae , attempting to access sites like www.uaeprison.com or www.arabtimes.com -lrb- published in the united states -rrb- brings up an apology for the site being blocked and an explanation ; it is " due to its content being inconsistent with the religious , cultural , political and moral values of the united arab emirates . "
it is not clear how the monopoly internet provider , etisilat , determines what contravenes the country 's values .
there is a right of reply on any blocked site message though , allowing surfers to suggest it be made accessible .
for many , the censorship of sites which question , discuss or oppose the ruling families of the gulf states and their absolute power , is anachronistic .
the uae is one of the fastest developing countries in the world , but this development is far more economic than political .
satirical blogs , parodying the city and its residents , such as secretdubai.blogspot.com , www.dubaienquirer.com and onebigconstructionsite.blogspot.com can be found .
internet users in dubai 's commercial free zones - like dubai internet city , dubai media city and knowledge village - are able to sidestep the strict state censorship by using a different proxy .
the more technically savvy users in other parts of the country are also finding ways to access the banned sites they want to view .
in march , there were reports internet cafe users could have their personal details recorded and kept on file .
the explanation from the authorities was that this was to curb " cyber crime " including hacking and sending spam emails , but it has brought into focus questions of personal privacy .
the opening-up of the telecoms sector which is due to allow another state-run company , du , to operate from later this year is unlikely to change the position on blocked sites .
perhaps one of the biggest annoyances for the mostly expatriate population in the emirates is the inaccessibility of internet telephony sites like www.skype.com.
this is widely seen as economic censorship ; the state wanting to ensure continuing large profits through migrant workers making international telephone calls .

west yorkshire police say more assaults happen around sporting events , particularly when drink is involved .
a car with a detective and a domestic violence co-ordinator is attending all domestic violence incidents in the city so better evidence can be collected .
det ch insp chris thompson said the force wanted to increase the number of offenders taken to court .
' tough approach ' he said : " we want to send a clear message to offenders that if they are involved in domestic violence we will arrest them , and if we do n't arrest them at the time the offence is committed we will continue to look for them until we find them .
" we are also identifying and arresting outstanding domestic violence suspects and prolific offenders and doing bail checks .
" in the run up to , and during the world cup , we will have extra resources to deal with domestic violence incidents and are taking a tough approach towards offenders in order to improve the quality of life for people living in the district . "
wakefield police deals with around 500 reports of domestic violence every month , he said .
