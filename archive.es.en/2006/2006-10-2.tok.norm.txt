the organization , however , declined klinsmann 's request , saying the new position should go to someone with a soccer background .

merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

" germany : a summer 's tale " allows audiences to listen in on the coach 's pre-match motivational speeches , as the team went to exceed all expectations at the world cup . wortmann - whose previous work includes " the miracle of bern " about germany 's victory in the 1954 world cup - himself played lower-division professional soccer , and his love of the game shows .
journalists given the chance to preview the film have been wildly enthusiastic about it . as a special treat , the film reveals one of the most hotly debated secrets from the 2006 world cup - the contents of the note sheet used by goalkeeper jens lehmann during the penalty shoot-out that led to germany 's dramatic victory over argentina . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 02.10.2006 germans sink their teeth into mctooth dental chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pretty smile , does n't always have to be expensive dental care in germany costs an arm and a leg but the new mctooth chain promises it wo n't cost patients their teeth .
costs are kept low by outsourcing the lab work to china and germans are cautiously taking the bait . the roughly 90 percent of germans insured under the statutory health system have after recent reforms been forced to pay much more of doctors ' bills out of their own pockets .
this is because the statutory insurers only meet about half of the total costs , and the patients have to pay the rest . the amount the patient has to pay can vary , depending on treatment .
patient-footed bills are particularly high for dental treatment , where the statutory health insurance only covers the run of the mill procedures .
germans who need crowns , bridges , implants or dentures are thus stuck with paying a hefty bill . it 's against this background that a dental discount chain called mczahn - or mctooth - has started operations in germany . mctooth plans nationwide expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies do n't cover all the costs for dental treatment the mctooth dental discount chain started up operations in the western german town of krefeld and is poised to have a total of some 30 branches throughout the country by the end of the year .
it keeps laboratory costs to a minimum by outsourcing all precision work on crowns , bridges and the like to china . for patients , the cheaper cost is the main factor for them to go to mctooth .
dirk frank , one of the discounter 's first patients in germany , said he had been considering seeking dental treatment in poland , where the costs are also considerably lower than in germany . " i ’ d been thinking about going to poland to get my teeth fixed , but then i had doubts about the quality of the dentists ' work there , " frank said .
" and i also knew that follow-up treatment would be a bit tricky .
i have no problem with the mctooth concept . " " the laboratory work is done in china keeping overall costs much lower .
but the quality will be acceptable , because the material for the lab work comes from germany , " he added . another patient , simone kleber , said she was n't sure whether she 'd be satisfied with the treatment .
but she freely admitted that if she did n't give mctooth a try , she 'd never know . " if i 'm not satisfied with the end result , i can easily go back to my old dentist , " she said .
" but it 's worth a try , and you have the same sort of warranty for the chinese lab work .
if anything falls apart , i 'll be back again in no time , believe you me ! " experts fear a decrease in quality care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things might not get this bad but you never know michael knittel from the german dentists ' association believes individual dental care is going to suffer .
" it is essential that the dentist and patient can discuss openly and frankly what sort of treatment would be proper and sensible in each individual case .
this is something patients should remember before jumping at mctooth 's offer . " knittel is referring to the conditions under which dentists join the mctooth chain .
they have to buy into it and become share-holders .
as the scheme is based on the sale of false teeth and dentures , doctors may be overly inclined to talk patients into getting replacements for their natural teeth when in fact alternative treatment would suffice . practitioner 's queuing to join franchise , says chief but mctooth boss werner brandenbusch argues that his dentists are responsible enough to refrain from such practices . and he is delighted with the response he is getting from the dental profession . " the list of dentists wanting to join us is endless , " he said .
" and i 'm not talking about newcomers , but well-established dentists .
they are telling us that they would be afraid of this new powerful competition .
so rather than living their lives in fear , they decide to jump aboard and be part of this exciting new scheme .
we have applicants from all german regions and cities . ” for mctooth customers like dirk frank the chain is a success in terms of savings .
" i have to pay around 1,000 euros for implants , " he said .
" that means altogether i will have saved between 500 and 1,000 euros . "
and the china-made implants are sitting just fine . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online dentistry : health care takes to the net in the search for more affordable dental care , some germans are letting dentists bid at online auction sites for the chance to work in their mouths .

it is similar to the booker prize in britain , but for novels written in the german language . a contemporary love story in " the have-nots " hacker uses 9/11 as the starting-point for a story about a chance encounter .
a world gone crazy provides the backdrop to this love story about a privileged young couple who have everything but achieve nothing . " i was dealing with the question of how we live , how we should live our lives properly .
whether we can be happy , and how much we should become involved , " said hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of sept .
11 is the background for hacker 's book the author explained that she 'd written the book out of concern for her well-to-do contemporaries .
she wondered why their life style disturbed her so much and was also concerned about her own involvement .
personal responsibility is a central issue to hacker . in " the have-nots " a couple meets at a party in berlin on the day of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
they split up but later the couple meets again by chance in a bar .
they marry , almost in haste , and follow their careers in london . it 's a tense time , in the run-up to the invasion of iraq .

it is similar to the booker prize in britain , but for novels written in the german language . a contemporary love story in " the have-nots " hacker uses 9/11 as the starting-point for a story about a chance encounter .
a world gone crazy provides the backdrop to this love story about a privileged young couple who have everything but achieve nothing . " i was dealing with the question of how we live , how we should live our lives properly .
whether we can be happy , and how much we should become involved , " said hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.10.2006 siemens the fall guy in benq insolvency scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq employees feel betrayed by siemens german benq employees and politicians have been putting the blame on siemens for its former mobile phone division 's insolvency , but determining whether the fault lies in munich or taipeh seems to be a matter of opinion . chancellor angela merkel has n't so far pointed any fingers , but she did single out siemens as being responsible for the 3,000 employees who will be out of a job when benq mobile closes shop in germany .
merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .
the paper wrote that investigators had decided against prosecuting the green party for hanging a flag adorned with a swastika in protest against the stuttgart ruling on the facade their national headquarters in berlin . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol .

director sönke wortmann 's eagerly anticipated documentary film " germany : a summer 's tale " premiers on tuesday in berlin , and soccer fans around the country are expected to pack cinemas . wortmann spent two years with the german national squad making the film , enjoying unprecedented access to players and coaches .
the 108-minute documentary has been edited down from more than 100 hours of footage and offers an intimate , behind-the-scenes view of the host nation 's world cup campaign . the film , much of which was shot with a hand-held camera , shows the players in their hotel rooms , on the team bus , on the practice field and in the locker room .
wortmann captures the team 's elation after beating mighty argentina in the tournament 's quarterfinals - and the players ' tears after crashing out against italy in the semis . " i had the feeling that i was so assimilated no one even noticed i was there , " wortmann recalled ahead of the film 's premier oct .
3 . klinsmann as hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german national coach jürgen klinsmann inspired a young and inexperienced squad .
as might be expected , wortmann focuses on the german national squad 's former coach jürgen klinsmann .
when klinsmann took over after the team 's disastrous performance in the 2004 european championship , many germans feared that the squad would embarrass itself on its home soil at the world cup . klinsmann , who lives in california , shook up the team with state-of-the-art fitness training methods and a decidedly american belief in the power of positive thinking .
" germany : a summer 's tale " allows audiences to listen in on the coach 's pre-match motivational speeches , as the team went to exceed all expectations at the world cup . wortmann - whose previous work includes " the miracle of bern " about germany 's victory in the 1954 world cup - himself played lower-division professional soccer , and his love of the game shows .
journalists given the chance to preview the film have been wildly enthusiastic about it . as a special treat , the film reveals one of the most hotly debated secrets from the 2006 world cup - the contents of the note sheet used by goalkeeper jens lehmann during the penalty shoot-out that led to germany 's dramatic victory over argentina . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

the 108-minute documentary has been edited down from more than 100 hours of footage and offers an intimate , behind-the-scenes view of the host nation 's world cup campaign . the film , much of which was shot with a hand-held camera , shows the players in their hotel rooms , on the team bus , on the practice field and in the locker room .
wortmann captures the team 's elation after beating mighty argentina in the tournament 's quarterfinals - and the players ' tears after crashing out against italy in the semis . " i had the feeling that i was so assimilated no one even noticed i was there , " wortmann recalled ahead of the film 's premier oct .

when klinsmann took over after the team 's disastrous performance in the 2004 european championship , many germans feared that the squad would embarrass itself on its home soil at the world cup . klinsmann , who lives in california , shook up the team with state-of-the-art fitness training methods and a decidedly american belief in the power of positive thinking .
" germany : a summer 's tale " allows audiences to listen in on the coach 's pre-match motivational speeches , as the team went to exceed all expectations at the world cup . wortmann - whose previous work includes " the miracle of bern " about germany 's victory in the 1954 world cup - himself played lower-division professional soccer , and his love of the game shows .
journalists given the chance to preview the film have been wildly enthusiastic about it . as a special treat , the film reveals one of the most hotly debated secrets from the 2006 world cup - the contents of the note sheet used by goalkeeper jens lehmann during the penalty shoot-out that led to germany 's dramatic victory over argentina . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .
the paper wrote that investigators had decided against prosecuting the green party for hanging a flag adorned with a swastika in protest against the stuttgart ruling on the facade their national headquarters in berlin . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol .

while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .

director sönke wortmann 's eagerly anticipated documentary film " germany : a summer 's tale " premiers on tuesday in berlin , and soccer fans around the country are expected to pack cinemas . wortmann spent two years with the german national squad making the film , enjoying unprecedented access to players and coaches .
the 108-minute documentary has been edited down from more than 100 hours of footage and offers an intimate , behind-the-scenes view of the host nation 's world cup campaign . the film , much of which was shot with a hand-held camera , shows the players in their hotel rooms , on the team bus , on the practice field and in the locker room .
wortmann captures the team 's elation after beating mighty argentina in the tournament 's quarterfinals - and the players ' tears after crashing out against italy in the semis . " i had the feeling that i was so assimilated no one even noticed i was there , " wortmann recalled ahead of the film 's premier oct .
3 . klinsmann as hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german national coach jürgen klinsmann inspired a young and inexperienced squad .
as might be expected , wortmann focuses on the german national squad 's former coach jürgen klinsmann .
when klinsmann took over after the team 's disastrous performance in the 2004 european championship , many germans feared that the squad would embarrass itself on its home soil at the world cup . klinsmann , who lives in california , shook up the team with state-of-the-art fitness training methods and a decidedly american belief in the power of positive thinking .
" germany : a summer 's tale " allows audiences to listen in on the coach 's pre-match motivational speeches , as the team went to exceed all expectations at the world cup . wortmann - whose previous work includes " the miracle of bern " about germany 's victory in the 1954 world cup - himself played lower-division professional soccer , and his love of the game shows .
journalists given the chance to preview the film have been wildly enthusiastic about it . as a special treat , the film reveals one of the most hotly debated secrets from the 2006 world cup - the contents of the note sheet used by goalkeeper jens lehmann during the penalty shoot-out that led to germany 's dramatic victory over argentina . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 02.10.2006 germans sink their teeth into mctooth dental chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pretty smile , does n't always have to be expensive dental care in germany costs an arm and a leg but the new mctooth chain promises it wo n't cost patients their teeth .
costs are kept low by outsourcing the lab work to china and germans are cautiously taking the bait . the roughly 90 percent of germans insured under the statutory health system have after recent reforms been forced to pay much more of doctors ' bills out of their own pockets .
this is because the statutory insurers only meet about half of the total costs , and the patients have to pay the rest . the amount the patient has to pay can vary , depending on treatment .
patient-footed bills are particularly high for dental treatment , where the statutory health insurance only covers the run of the mill procedures .
germans who need crowns , bridges , implants or dentures are thus stuck with paying a hefty bill . it 's against this background that a dental discount chain called mczahn - or mctooth - has started operations in germany . mctooth plans nationwide expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies do n't cover all the costs for dental treatment the mctooth dental discount chain started up operations in the western german town of krefeld and is poised to have a total of some 30 branches throughout the country by the end of the year .
it keeps laboratory costs to a minimum by outsourcing all precision work on crowns , bridges and the like to china . for patients , the cheaper cost is the main factor for them to go to mctooth .
dirk frank , one of the discounter 's first patients in germany , said he had been considering seeking dental treatment in poland , where the costs are also considerably lower than in germany . " i ’ d been thinking about going to poland to get my teeth fixed , but then i had doubts about the quality of the dentists ' work there , " frank said .
" and i also knew that follow-up treatment would be a bit tricky .
i have no problem with the mctooth concept . " " the laboratory work is done in china keeping overall costs much lower .
but the quality will be acceptable , because the material for the lab work comes from germany , " he added . another patient , simone kleber , said she was n't sure whether she 'd be satisfied with the treatment .
but she freely admitted that if she did n't give mctooth a try , she 'd never know . " if i 'm not satisfied with the end result , i can easily go back to my old dentist , " she said .
" but it 's worth a try , and you have the same sort of warranty for the chinese lab work .
if anything falls apart , i 'll be back again in no time , believe you me ! " experts fear a decrease in quality care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things might not get this bad but you never know michael knittel from the german dentists ' association believes individual dental care is going to suffer .
" it is essential that the dentist and patient can discuss openly and frankly what sort of treatment would be proper and sensible in each individual case .
this is something patients should remember before jumping at mctooth 's offer . " knittel is referring to the conditions under which dentists join the mctooth chain .
they have to buy into it and become share-holders .
as the scheme is based on the sale of false teeth and dentures , doctors may be overly inclined to talk patients into getting replacements for their natural teeth when in fact alternative treatment would suffice . practitioner 's queuing to join franchise , says chief but mctooth boss werner brandenbusch argues that his dentists are responsible enough to refrain from such practices . and he is delighted with the response he is getting from the dental profession . " the list of dentists wanting to join us is endless , " he said .
" and i 'm not talking about newcomers , but well-established dentists .
they are telling us that they would be afraid of this new powerful competition .
so rather than living their lives in fear , they decide to jump aboard and be part of this exciting new scheme .
we have applicants from all german regions and cities . ” for mctooth customers like dirk frank the chain is a success in terms of savings .
" i have to pay around 1,000 euros for implants , " he said .
" that means altogether i will have saved between 500 and 1,000 euros . "
and the china-made implants are sitting just fine . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online dentistry : health care takes to the net in the search for more affordable dental care , some germans are letting dentists bid at online auction sites for the chance to work in their mouths .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.10.2006 siemens the fall guy in benq insolvency scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq employees feel betrayed by siemens german benq employees and politicians have been putting the blame on siemens for its former mobile phone division 's insolvency , but determining whether the fault lies in munich or taipeh seems to be a matter of opinion . chancellor angela merkel has n't so far pointed any fingers , but she did single out siemens as being responsible for the 3,000 employees who will be out of a job when benq mobile closes shop in germany .
merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .

merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .

it is similar to the booker prize in britain , but for novels written in the german language . a contemporary love story in " the have-nots " hacker uses 9/11 as the starting-point for a story about a chance encounter .
a world gone crazy provides the backdrop to this love story about a privileged young couple who have everything but achieve nothing . " i was dealing with the question of how we live , how we should live our lives properly .
whether we can be happy , and how much we should become involved , " said hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of sept .
11 is the background for hacker 's book the author explained that she 'd written the book out of concern for her well-to-do contemporaries .
she wondered why their life style disturbed her so much and was also concerned about her own involvement .
personal responsibility is a central issue to hacker . in " the have-nots " a couple meets at a party in berlin on the day of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
they split up but later the couple meets again by chance in a bar .
they marry , almost in haste , and follow their careers in london . it 's a tense time , in the run-up to the invasion of iraq .
and the couple , seemingly so successful , can only watch as their lives fall apart .
this is the portrait of a generation with no aims . the jury praised hacker for showing how world events can affect the lives of individuals , and how an inability to sympathise and make decisions can clash with a need for ' existential ' experience . frankfurt-born hacker , who is a graduate in philosophy and jewish studies and lived in israel from 1990 until 1996 , currently makes her home in berlin . she first aroused international attention with her novels " the lifeguard " and " morpheus " . german authors dealing with big issues six authors were still in the running when the jury , nominees , press and who ’ s who of germany ’ s literary scene as well as the national book trade gathered for the award ceremony in frankfurt ’ s römer city hall on the night of oct .
2 . the announcement of the winner was carefully timed for the eve of the frankfurt book fair .
all of the shortlisted works dealt with intense issues : terrorism , the division of germany , the bosnian war , the business world , and encounters with foreign cultures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german book prize was founded in 2005 see the link below for a complete list of the shortlisted works and other works by the shortlisted authors that have been published in english . this year ’ s german book prize jury included authors john von düffel and terezia mora , literary critics volker hage , elmar krekeler and pia reinacher , as well as the tv literary editor denis scheck and bookseller stephan samtleben . they had the daunting task of selecting the best novel published in germany , austria and switzerland between oct .
1 , 2005 and sept .
12 , 2006 . " we have read our way through a mountain of novels and even asked for more titles in addition to those nominated by the publishing companies since we did n't want to be limited to the initial choices , " said jury spokesman hage . award in its second year this high-profile fiction competition was founded in 2005 by the german booksellers and publishers association to give contemporary german literature a boost in an increasingly tough overseas market .

director sönke wortmann 's eagerly anticipated documentary film " germany : a summer 's tale " premiers on tuesday in berlin , and soccer fans around the country are expected to pack cinemas . wortmann spent two years with the german national squad making the film , enjoying unprecedented access to players and coaches .
the 108-minute documentary has been edited down from more than 100 hours of footage and offers an intimate , behind-the-scenes view of the host nation 's world cup campaign . the film , much of which was shot with a hand-held camera , shows the players in their hotel rooms , on the team bus , on the practice field and in the locker room .
wortmann captures the team 's elation after beating mighty argentina in the tournament 's quarterfinals - and the players ' tears after crashing out against italy in the semis . " i had the feeling that i was so assimilated no one even noticed i was there , " wortmann recalled ahead of the film 's premier oct .
3 . klinsmann as hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german national coach jürgen klinsmann inspired a young and inexperienced squad .
as might be expected , wortmann focuses on the german national squad 's former coach jürgen klinsmann .
when klinsmann took over after the team 's disastrous performance in the 2004 european championship , many germans feared that the squad would embarrass itself on its home soil at the world cup . klinsmann , who lives in california , shook up the team with state-of-the-art fitness training methods and a decidedly american belief in the power of positive thinking .
" germany : a summer 's tale " allows audiences to listen in on the coach 's pre-match motivational speeches , as the team went to exceed all expectations at the world cup . wortmann - whose previous work includes " the miracle of bern " about germany 's victory in the 1954 world cup - himself played lower-division professional soccer , and his love of the game shows .
journalists given the chance to preview the film have been wildly enthusiastic about it . as a special treat , the film reveals one of the most hotly debated secrets from the 2006 world cup - the contents of the note sheet used by goalkeeper jens lehmann during the penalty shoot-out that led to germany 's dramatic victory over argentina . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

director sönke wortmann 's eagerly anticipated documentary film " germany : a summer 's tale " premiers on tuesday in berlin , and soccer fans around the country are expected to pack cinemas . wortmann spent two years with the german national squad making the film , enjoying unprecedented access to players and coaches .
the 108-minute documentary has been edited down from more than 100 hours of footage and offers an intimate , behind-the-scenes view of the host nation 's world cup campaign . the film , much of which was shot with a hand-held camera , shows the players in their hotel rooms , on the team bus , on the practice field and in the locker room .
wortmann captures the team 's elation after beating mighty argentina in the tournament 's quarterfinals - and the players ' tears after crashing out against italy in the semis . " i had the feeling that i was so assimilated no one even noticed i was there , " wortmann recalled ahead of the film 's premier oct .

as might be expected , wortmann focuses on the german national squad 's former coach jürgen klinsmann .
when klinsmann took over after the team 's disastrous performance in the 2004 european championship , many germans feared that the squad would embarrass itself on its home soil at the world cup . klinsmann , who lives in california , shook up the team with state-of-the-art fitness training methods and a decidedly american belief in the power of positive thinking .
" germany : a summer 's tale " allows audiences to listen in on the coach 's pre-match motivational speeches , as the team went to exceed all expectations at the world cup . wortmann - whose previous work includes " the miracle of bern " about germany 's victory in the 1954 world cup - himself played lower-division professional soccer , and his love of the game shows .
journalists given the chance to preview the film have been wildly enthusiastic about it . as a special treat , the film reveals one of the most hotly debated secrets from the 2006 world cup - the contents of the note sheet used by goalkeeper jens lehmann during the penalty shoot-out that led to germany 's dramatic victory over argentina . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .
the paper wrote that investigators had decided against prosecuting the green party for hanging a flag adorned with a swastika in protest against the stuttgart ruling on the facade their national headquarters in berlin . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol .

but her well-earned reputation comes from her high musical standards , not from the novelty of being a female conductor . at the age of 25 , tali founded the estonian-finnish symphony orchestra -lrb- now called the nordic symphony orchestra -rrb- with her twin sister kadri .
their goal ?
to promote cultural understanding between the two countries and cooperation between the world 's leading young musicians . the orchestra gives itself an innovative edge by thematicizing it program each year - this season is all about " legends . " nso 's audiences are young , said tali , in an interview with the beethoven festival .
" we in estonia are trying to find a slightly different way to access the audience . " self-supporting orchestras can survive while in countries like germany the arts are almost entirely funded by the state , the tali twins have managed to finance their orchestra for the last eight years entirely with sponsorships and donations - a precursor of european orchestras in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's beethoven festival is arleady history , but classical music is n't violinist maxim vengerov qualifies as a representative of classical music 's up-and-coming , not only because he 's not yet over the hill himself but also because he 's personally committed to working with children . after being named " ambassador for music " by unicef in 1997 - the first classical musician to get the job - he playing for abducted child-soldiers in uganda , disadvantaged children in harlem , child drug addicts in thailand and kids on both sides of the kosovan ethnic divide . being different is nothing new sunday 's program appeared rather traditional - at first glance .
prokofiev 's symphony no. 1 , mozart 's violin concerto no. 4 , and beethoven 's symphony no. 2 .
for the 21st century , post-post-modern audience it 's easy to forget that these guys were also rebels of sorts . prokofiev 's first symphony -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , dubbed symphonie classique , is a parody of the classical symphony .
the young russian composer , 26 years old at the time , monkeyed with traditional harmonies in some passages , toyed with the form and provoked chuckles from a audience that had lived through the october russian revolution just months before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's bones -lrb- reconstructed here -rrb- are healthier than they may look beethoven 's second symphony was written early in his musical development .
his drastic musical innovations would come a bit later , but the background of the piece is humanly relevant to any generation . the composer was " a great man entering a huge crisis but writing light-hearted , affirmative music - and that while beginning to grow deaf ! " said anu tali .
" people have found memos of his that mention the possibility of suicide but never reached the public eye .
taken altogether , i find it adds up to a very powerful story . " triple overtime for team beethoven tali 's conducting sunday was youthful and energetic but so professional that it 's easy to excuse the parts that may have been a bit too well choreographed , too pre-meditated .
just as for the seasoned center , the spontaneous slam-dunk comes with maturity and experience . with their innovative tendencies , vigor and entrepreneurship , musicians like anu tali , maxim vengerov , and their budding colleagues around the world prove that classical music is alive and well - and not just for its own sake .
the music still has something to say and there are still a few talented individuals who will do anything to say it . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rattle rattles some with a novel approach berlin once welcomed british conductor sir simon rattle enthusiastically as a breath of fresh air .

merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .

the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .

there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm .

while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.10.2006 siemens the fall guy in benq insolvency scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq employees feel betrayed by siemens german benq employees and politicians have been putting the blame on siemens for its former mobile phone division 's insolvency , but determining whether the fault lies in munich or taipeh seems to be a matter of opinion . chancellor angela merkel has n't so far pointed any fingers , but she did single out siemens as being responsible for the 3,000 employees who will be out of a job when benq mobile closes shop in germany .
merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .
the paper wrote that investigators had decided against prosecuting the green party for hanging a flag adorned with a swastika in protest against the stuttgart ruling on the facade their national headquarters in berlin . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .
the paper wrote that investigators had decided against prosecuting the green party for hanging a flag adorned with a swastika in protest against the stuttgart ruling on the facade their national headquarters in berlin . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol .

" after reviewing about half a dozen popular seafood dishes , including fried plaice , swordfish or tuna steaks and paella , the conservation group warned that stocks of the basic ingredients were either threatened by over-fishing or were often fished in a manner that produced huge collateral damage . " think carefully before you go and eat cod , swordfish or tuna or plaice , " woolford said . wasteful fishing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a major problem with fishing is waste wwf said that up to 80 percent of some plaice catches in the north sea were thrown back overboard dead or dying , partly because the fish netted were too small . depletion of northern cod stocks , a rival favorite for local dinner tables , has already led to official restrictions on fishing .
the eu has also set about trying to downsize member nations ' fishing fleets . woolford said reforms to the common fisheries policy in the european union outlined three years ago were " rather promising . "
at the same time he said it was ' ' rather alarming " from the wwf 's point of view that there 's still quite a trail of waste and destruction behind european fisheries . the wwf claimed earlier this month that some types of tuna in the mediterranean sea are being illegally fished in excess of international quotas . not enough fish to meet demands woolford , said such a buoyant market has encouraged unsustainable fishing practices . " there are too many boats chasing too few fish , subsidies maintaining the existing size of the european fleet , and a large degree of illegal fishing - we 've seen this with blue-fin tuna in the mediterranean and cod in the baltic , " woolford said . " certainly fish is now much more popular and fashionable than it used to be , " he said .
' ' sixty percent of what 's on european dinner plates comes from outside european waters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fish is appearing more and more on the european plate the report also pointed to illegal driftnet fishing in morocco , which targets swordfish for the european market and catches one swordfish for every two sharks , needlessly killing an estimated 100,000 sharks per year . eu attempts to revive declining fish stocks on sept .
2 , the eu commission proposed a 15 percent cut in quotas on cod fishing in the baltic sea in an attempt to replenish stocks .
european fisheries ministers are due to examine the proposal at a meeting in october . two hundred european boats will be allowed to fish in the region subject to a new two-year ceiling on some types of catches , in exchange for 86 million euros -lrb- 109 million dollars -rrb- in grants for mauritania , including funding for the north african country 's fishing industry . the wwf said consumers should look for fish with a marine stewardship council label , which certifies that the fish has come from a sustainable and well-managed fishery .

25 meeting between the pope and 22 muslim envoys in an effort to patch up diplomatic relations and reiterate his desire for inter-faith dialogue .
but the meeting merely served to confirm that benedict does not see dialogue in the same way as his predecessor , analysts charge . meeting with muslim leaders underlines point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's meeting with muslim leaders did n't help the day after this very formal audience - which lasted barely half an hour - the organization of islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- issued a statement still calling for the head of the roman catholic church to " retract or redress " his comments . " the pope 's address reinforced in the muslim world the impression that they can expect nothing from the west , " french academic olivier roy , author of " globalized islam , " told reporters . " his speech also shrank the room given to christian minorities in the east who live among a muslim majority -lrb- when -rrb- john paul ii knew how to put across the idea that not all christians align themselves with the policies of -lrb- us president -rrb- george -lrb- w. -rrb-
bush . " middle east unrest should be taken into account bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's speech only inflamed muslim anger for jean-jacques perennes , secretary general of the dominican institute for oriental studies -lrb- ideo -rrb- in cairo , " the hyper-sensitivity of mentalities has to be taken into account , " particularly in light of events in iraq , lebanon and between israel and the palestinians .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .

the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .

while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .

it is similar to the booker prize in britain , but for novels written in the german language . a contemporary love story in " the have-nots " hacker uses 9/11 as the starting-point for a story about a chance encounter .
a world gone crazy provides the backdrop to this love story about a privileged young couple who have everything but achieve nothing . " i was dealing with the question of how we live , how we should live our lives properly .
whether we can be happy , and how much we should become involved , " said hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of sept .
11 is the background for hacker 's book the author explained that she 'd written the book out of concern for her well-to-do contemporaries .

personal responsibility is a central issue to hacker . in " the have-nots " a couple meets at a party in berlin on the day of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
they split up but later the couple meets again by chance in a bar .
they marry , almost in haste , and follow their careers in london . it 's a tense time , in the run-up to the invasion of iraq .
and the couple , seemingly so successful , can only watch as their lives fall apart .
this is the portrait of a generation with no aims . the jury praised hacker for showing how world events can affect the lives of individuals , and how an inability to sympathise and make decisions can clash with a need for ' existential ' experience . frankfurt-born hacker , who is a graduate in philosophy and jewish studies and lived in israel from 1990 until 1996 , currently makes her home in berlin . she first aroused international attention with her novels " the lifeguard " and " morpheus " . german authors dealing with big issues six authors were still in the running when the jury , nominees , press and who ’ s who of germany ’ s literary scene as well as the national book trade gathered for the award ceremony in frankfurt ’ s römer city hall on the night of oct .
2 . the announcement of the winner was carefully timed for the eve of the frankfurt book fair .
all of the shortlisted works dealt with intense issues : terrorism , the division of germany , the bosnian war , the business world , and encounters with foreign cultures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german book prize was founded in 2005 see the link below for a complete list of the shortlisted works and other works by the shortlisted authors that have been published in english . this year ’ s german book prize jury included authors john von düffel and terezia mora , literary critics volker hage , elmar krekeler and pia reinacher , as well as the tv literary editor denis scheck and bookseller stephan samtleben . they had the daunting task of selecting the best novel published in germany , austria and switzerland between oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 02.10.2006 a fly-on-the-wall look at germany 's world cup campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director sönke wortmann spent two years with the german national team sönke wortmann 's " germany : a summer 's tale " tells the story of how former german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took a team in disarray to a third-place finish in the world cup . it 's only two-and-a-half months since the 2006 world cup came to an end , but german moviegoers are already getting the chance to relive the excitement .
director sönke wortmann 's eagerly anticipated documentary film " germany : a summer 's tale " premiers on tuesday in berlin , and soccer fans around the country are expected to pack cinemas . wortmann spent two years with the german national squad making the film , enjoying unprecedented access to players and coaches .
the 108-minute documentary has been edited down from more than 100 hours of footage and offers an intimate , behind-the-scenes view of the host nation 's world cup campaign . the film , much of which was shot with a hand-held camera , shows the players in their hotel rooms , on the team bus , on the practice field and in the locker room .
wortmann captures the team 's elation after beating mighty argentina in the tournament 's quarterfinals - and the players ' tears after crashing out against italy in the semis . " i had the feeling that i was so assimilated no one even noticed i was there , " wortmann recalled ahead of the film 's premier oct .
3 . klinsmann as hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german national coach jürgen klinsmann inspired a young and inexperienced squad .
as might be expected , wortmann focuses on the german national squad 's former coach jürgen klinsmann .
when klinsmann took over after the team 's disastrous performance in the 2004 european championship , many germans feared that the squad would embarrass itself on its home soil at the world cup . klinsmann , who lives in california , shook up the team with state-of-the-art fitness training methods and a decidedly american belief in the power of positive thinking .
" germany : a summer 's tale " allows audiences to listen in on the coach 's pre-match motivational speeches , as the team went to exceed all expectations at the world cup . wortmann - whose previous work includes " the miracle of bern " about germany 's victory in the 1954 world cup - himself played lower-division professional soccer , and his love of the game shows .
journalists given the chance to preview the film have been wildly enthusiastic about it . as a special treat , the film reveals one of the most hotly debated secrets from the 2006 world cup - the contents of the note sheet used by goalkeeper jens lehmann during the penalty shoot-out that led to germany 's dramatic victory over argentina . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.10.2006 siemens the fall guy in benq insolvency scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq employees feel betrayed by siemens german benq employees and politicians have been putting the blame on siemens for its former mobile phone division 's insolvency , but determining whether the fault lies in munich or taipeh seems to be a matter of opinion . chancellor angela merkel has n't so far pointed any fingers , but she did single out siemens as being responsible for the 3,000 employees who will be out of a job when benq mobile closes shop in germany .
merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .

siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .

siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .
the paper wrote that investigators had decided against prosecuting the green party for hanging a flag adorned with a swastika in protest against the stuttgart ruling on the facade their national headquarters in berlin . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 02.10.2006 germans sink their teeth into mctooth dental chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pretty smile , does n't always have to be expensive dental care in germany costs an arm and a leg but the new mctooth chain promises it wo n't cost patients their teeth .
costs are kept low by outsourcing the lab work to china and germans are cautiously taking the bait . the roughly 90 percent of germans insured under the statutory health system have after recent reforms been forced to pay much more of doctors ' bills out of their own pockets .
this is because the statutory insurers only meet about half of the total costs , and the patients have to pay the rest . the amount the patient has to pay can vary , depending on treatment .
patient-footed bills are particularly high for dental treatment , where the statutory health insurance only covers the run of the mill procedures .
germans who need crowns , bridges , implants or dentures are thus stuck with paying a hefty bill . it 's against this background that a dental discount chain called mczahn - or mctooth - has started operations in germany . mctooth plans nationwide expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies do n't cover all the costs for dental treatment the mctooth dental discount chain started up operations in the western german town of krefeld and is poised to have a total of some 30 branches throughout the country by the end of the year .
it keeps laboratory costs to a minimum by outsourcing all precision work on crowns , bridges and the like to china . for patients , the cheaper cost is the main factor for them to go to mctooth .
dirk frank , one of the discounter 's first patients in germany , said he had been considering seeking dental treatment in poland , where the costs are also considerably lower than in germany . " i ’ d been thinking about going to poland to get my teeth fixed , but then i had doubts about the quality of the dentists ' work there , " frank said .
" and i also knew that follow-up treatment would be a bit tricky .
i have no problem with the mctooth concept . " " the laboratory work is done in china keeping overall costs much lower .
but the quality will be acceptable , because the material for the lab work comes from germany , " he added . another patient , simone kleber , said she was n't sure whether she 'd be satisfied with the treatment .
but she freely admitted that if she did n't give mctooth a try , she 'd never know . " if i 'm not satisfied with the end result , i can easily go back to my old dentist , " she said .
" but it 's worth a try , and you have the same sort of warranty for the chinese lab work .
if anything falls apart , i 'll be back again in no time , believe you me ! " experts fear a decrease in quality care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things might not get this bad but you never know michael knittel from the german dentists ' association believes individual dental care is going to suffer .
" it is essential that the dentist and patient can discuss openly and frankly what sort of treatment would be proper and sensible in each individual case .
this is something patients should remember before jumping at mctooth 's offer . " knittel is referring to the conditions under which dentists join the mctooth chain .
they have to buy into it and become share-holders .
as the scheme is based on the sale of false teeth and dentures , doctors may be overly inclined to talk patients into getting replacements for their natural teeth when in fact alternative treatment would suffice . practitioner 's queuing to join franchise , says chief but mctooth boss werner brandenbusch argues that his dentists are responsible enough to refrain from such practices . and he is delighted with the response he is getting from the dental profession . " the list of dentists wanting to join us is endless , " he said .
" and i 'm not talking about newcomers , but well-established dentists .
they are telling us that they would be afraid of this new powerful competition .
so rather than living their lives in fear , they decide to jump aboard and be part of this exciting new scheme .
we have applicants from all german regions and cities . ” for mctooth customers like dirk frank the chain is a success in terms of savings .
" i have to pay around 1,000 euros for implants , " he said .
" that means altogether i will have saved between 500 and 1,000 euros . "
and the china-made implants are sitting just fine . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online dentistry : health care takes to the net in the search for more affordable dental care , some germans are letting dentists bid at online auction sites for the chance to work in their mouths .

it is similar to the booker prize in britain , but for novels written in the german language . a contemporary love story in " the have-nots " hacker uses 9/11 as the starting-point for a story about a chance encounter .
a world gone crazy provides the backdrop to this love story about a privileged young couple who have everything but achieve nothing . " i was dealing with the question of how we live , how we should live our lives properly .
whether we can be happy , and how much we should become involved , " said hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of sept .
11 is the background for hacker 's book the author explained that she 'd written the book out of concern for her well-to-do contemporaries .

this is the portrait of a generation with no aims . the jury praised hacker for showing how world events can affect the lives of individuals , and how an inability to sympathise and make decisions can clash with a need for ' existential ' experience . frankfurt-born hacker , who is a graduate in philosophy and jewish studies and lived in israel from 1990 until 1996 , currently makes her home in berlin . she first aroused international attention with her novels " the lifeguard " and " morpheus " . german authors dealing with big issues six authors were still in the running when the jury , nominees , press and who ’ s who of germany ’ s literary scene as well as the national book trade gathered for the award ceremony in frankfurt ’ s römer city hall on the night of oct .

1 , 2005 and sept .
12 , 2006 . " we have read our way through a mountain of novels and even asked for more titles in addition to those nominated by the publishing companies since we did n't want to be limited to the initial choices , " said jury spokesman hage . award in its second year this high-profile fiction competition was founded in 2005 by the german booksellers and publishers association to give contemporary german literature a boost in an increasingly tough overseas market . " the presentation of the german book prize has helped to boost confidence in the quality of contemporary german literature , aroused expectations for the continuation and increased the appetite for new literary discoveries , " said gottfried honnefelder , president of the german booksellers association and chairman of the german book prize academy . last year austrian novelist arno geiger received the prize for his epic family saga " es geht uns gut " -lrb- " we are doing fine " -rrb- , published by hanser . deutsche welle supports the german book prize primarily with media activities abroad . kate cox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finalists announced for german book prize the search for this year 's best german language novel is underway .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .

merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 02.10.2006 beethoven 's not just rolling over - he 's alive and well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conductor anu tali has the talent and the initiative to keep classical music alive beethoven and mozart are n't just names on your grandmother 's record shelf and it was no coincidence that this year 's beethoven festival closed sunday with performances by the next generation of classical musicians . anu tali from estonia conducted the closing concert for the 2006 beethoven festival with the kind of sincerity and raw energy that only comes from someone standing at the threshold of her career . after all , college basketball is popular for the very same reason .
those boys love their game with heart and soul and want more than anything to make it big . conductor anu tali and violin soloist maxim vengerov , both under 35 years and with old-school training , are not there to preserve a half-dead musical tradition .
they 're recreating one that breathes new life into the classics instead of exchanging beethoven and friends for the hip avant-garde . " it 's good to be different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim vengerov performed mozart 's concerto no. 4 with finely chiseled tones but new still means different - at least in some ways . " perhaps it 's even simpler being a woman because one if different , " said the conductor , who is petit in stature with cropped blond hair .
" and it 's always good to be different . " nevertheless , she downplays her femininity , taking up the baton sunday evening in a tuxedo complete with tails and a cummerbund .
but her well-earned reputation comes from her high musical standards , not from the novelty of being a female conductor . at the age of 25 , tali founded the estonian-finnish symphony orchestra -lrb- now called the nordic symphony orchestra -rrb- with her twin sister kadri .
their goal ?
to promote cultural understanding between the two countries and cooperation between the world 's leading young musicians . the orchestra gives itself an innovative edge by thematicizing it program each year - this season is all about " legends . " nso 's audiences are young , said tali , in an interview with the beethoven festival .
" we in estonia are trying to find a slightly different way to access the audience . " self-supporting orchestras can survive while in countries like germany the arts are almost entirely funded by the state , the tali twins have managed to finance their orchestra for the last eight years entirely with sponsorships and donations - a precursor of european orchestras in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's beethoven festival is arleady history , but classical music is n't violinist maxim vengerov qualifies as a representative of classical music 's up-and-coming , not only because he 's not yet over the hill himself but also because he 's personally committed to working with children . after being named " ambassador for music " by unicef in 1997 - the first classical musician to get the job - he playing for abducted child-soldiers in uganda , disadvantaged children in harlem , child drug addicts in thailand and kids on both sides of the kosovan ethnic divide . being different is nothing new sunday 's program appeared rather traditional - at first glance .
prokofiev 's symphony no. 1 , mozart 's violin concerto no. 4 , and beethoven 's symphony no. 2 .
for the 21st century , post-post-modern audience it 's easy to forget that these guys were also rebels of sorts . prokofiev 's first symphony -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , dubbed symphonie classique , is a parody of the classical symphony .
the young russian composer , 26 years old at the time , monkeyed with traditional harmonies in some passages , toyed with the form and provoked chuckles from a audience that had lived through the october russian revolution just months before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's bones -lrb- reconstructed here -rrb- are healthier than they may look beethoven 's second symphony was written early in his musical development .
his drastic musical innovations would come a bit later , but the background of the piece is humanly relevant to any generation . the composer was " a great man entering a huge crisis but writing light-hearted , affirmative music - and that while beginning to grow deaf ! " said anu tali .
" people have found memos of his that mention the possibility of suicide but never reached the public eye .
taken altogether , i find it adds up to a very powerful story . " triple overtime for team beethoven tali 's conducting sunday was youthful and energetic but so professional that it 's easy to excuse the parts that may have been a bit too well choreographed , too pre-meditated .
just as for the seasoned center , the spontaneous slam-dunk comes with maturity and experience . with their innovative tendencies , vigor and entrepreneurship , musicians like anu tali , maxim vengerov , and their budding colleagues around the world prove that classical music is alive and well - and not just for its own sake .
the music still has something to say and there are still a few talented individuals who will do anything to say it . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rattle rattles some with a novel approach berlin once welcomed british conductor sir simon rattle enthusiastically as a breath of fresh air .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 02.10.2006 beethoven 's not just rolling over - he 's alive and well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conductor anu tali has the talent and the initiative to keep classical music alive beethoven and mozart are n't just names on your grandmother 's record shelf and it was no coincidence that this year 's beethoven festival closed sunday with performances by the next generation of classical musicians . anu tali from estonia conducted the closing concert for the 2006 beethoven festival with the kind of sincerity and raw energy that only comes from someone standing at the threshold of her career . after all , college basketball is popular for the very same reason .
those boys love their game with heart and soul and want more than anything to make it big . conductor anu tali and violin soloist maxim vengerov , both under 35 years and with old-school training , are not there to preserve a half-dead musical tradition .
they 're recreating one that breathes new life into the classics instead of exchanging beethoven and friends for the hip avant-garde . " it 's good to be different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim vengerov performed mozart 's concerto no. 4 with finely chiseled tones but new still means different - at least in some ways . " perhaps it 's even simpler being a woman because one if different , " said the conductor , who is petit in stature with cropped blond hair .
" and it 's always good to be different . " nevertheless , she downplays her femininity , taking up the baton sunday evening in a tuxedo complete with tails and a cummerbund .
but her well-earned reputation comes from her high musical standards , not from the novelty of being a female conductor . at the age of 25 , tali founded the estonian-finnish symphony orchestra -lrb- now called the nordic symphony orchestra -rrb- with her twin sister kadri .
their goal ?
to promote cultural understanding between the two countries and cooperation between the world 's leading young musicians . the orchestra gives itself an innovative edge by thematicizing it program each year - this season is all about " legends . " nso 's audiences are young , said tali , in an interview with the beethoven festival .
" we in estonia are trying to find a slightly different way to access the audience . " self-supporting orchestras can survive while in countries like germany the arts are almost entirely funded by the state , the tali twins have managed to finance their orchestra for the last eight years entirely with sponsorships and donations - a precursor of european orchestras in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's beethoven festival is arleady history , but classical music is n't violinist maxim vengerov qualifies as a representative of classical music 's up-and-coming , not only because he 's not yet over the hill himself but also because he 's personally committed to working with children . after being named " ambassador for music " by unicef in 1997 - the first classical musician to get the job - he playing for abducted child-soldiers in uganda , disadvantaged children in harlem , child drug addicts in thailand and kids on both sides of the kosovan ethnic divide . being different is nothing new sunday 's program appeared rather traditional - at first glance .
prokofiev 's symphony no. 1 , mozart 's violin concerto no. 4 , and beethoven 's symphony no. 2 .
for the 21st century , post-post-modern audience it 's easy to forget that these guys were also rebels of sorts . prokofiev 's first symphony -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , dubbed symphonie classique , is a parody of the classical symphony .
the young russian composer , 26 years old at the time , monkeyed with traditional harmonies in some passages , toyed with the form and provoked chuckles from a audience that had lived through the october russian revolution just months before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's bones -lrb- reconstructed here -rrb- are healthier than they may look beethoven 's second symphony was written early in his musical development .
his drastic musical innovations would come a bit later , but the background of the piece is humanly relevant to any generation . the composer was " a great man entering a huge crisis but writing light-hearted , affirmative music - and that while beginning to grow deaf ! " said anu tali .
" people have found memos of his that mention the possibility of suicide but never reached the public eye .
taken altogether , i find it adds up to a very powerful story . " triple overtime for team beethoven tali 's conducting sunday was youthful and energetic but so professional that it 's easy to excuse the parts that may have been a bit too well choreographed , too pre-meditated .
just as for the seasoned center , the spontaneous slam-dunk comes with maturity and experience . with their innovative tendencies , vigor and entrepreneurship , musicians like anu tali , maxim vengerov , and their budding colleagues around the world prove that classical music is alive and well - and not just for its own sake .
the music still has something to say and there are still a few talented individuals who will do anything to say it . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rattle rattles some with a novel approach berlin once welcomed british conductor sir simon rattle enthusiastically as a breath of fresh air .

it is similar to the booker prize in britain , but for novels written in the german language . a contemporary love story in " the have-nots " hacker uses 9/11 as the starting-point for a story about a chance encounter .
a world gone crazy provides the backdrop to this love story about a privileged young couple who have everything but achieve nothing . " i was dealing with the question of how we live , how we should live our lives properly .
whether we can be happy , and how much we should become involved , " said hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of sept .
11 is the background for hacker 's book the author explained that she 'd written the book out of concern for her well-to-do contemporaries .
she wondered why their life style disturbed her so much and was also concerned about her own involvement .
personal responsibility is a central issue to hacker . in " the have-nots " a couple meets at a party in berlin on the day of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
they split up but later the couple meets again by chance in a bar .
they marry , almost in haste , and follow their careers in london . it 's a tense time , in the run-up to the invasion of iraq .
and the couple , seemingly so successful , can only watch as their lives fall apart .

" after reviewing about half a dozen popular seafood dishes , including fried plaice , swordfish or tuna steaks and paella , the conservation group warned that stocks of the basic ingredients were either threatened by over-fishing or were often fished in a manner that produced huge collateral damage . " think carefully before you go and eat cod , swordfish or tuna or plaice , " woolford said . wasteful fishing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a major problem with fishing is waste wwf said that up to 80 percent of some plaice catches in the north sea were thrown back overboard dead or dying , partly because the fish netted were too small . depletion of northern cod stocks , a rival favorite for local dinner tables , has already led to official restrictions on fishing .
the eu has also set about trying to downsize member nations ' fishing fleets . woolford said reforms to the common fisheries policy in the european union outlined three years ago were " rather promising . "
at the same time he said it was ' ' rather alarming " from the wwf 's point of view that there 's still quite a trail of waste and destruction behind european fisheries . the wwf claimed earlier this month that some types of tuna in the mediterranean sea are being illegally fished in excess of international quotas . not enough fish to meet demands woolford , said such a buoyant market has encouraged unsustainable fishing practices . " there are too many boats chasing too few fish , subsidies maintaining the existing size of the european fleet , and a large degree of illegal fishing - we 've seen this with blue-fin tuna in the mediterranean and cod in the baltic , " woolford said . " certainly fish is now much more popular and fashionable than it used to be , " he said .
' ' sixty percent of what 's on european dinner plates comes from outside european waters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fish is appearing more and more on the european plate the report also pointed to illegal driftnet fishing in morocco , which targets swordfish for the european market and catches one swordfish for every two sharks , needlessly killing an estimated 100,000 sharks per year . eu attempts to revive declining fish stocks on sept .
2 , the eu commission proposed a 15 percent cut in quotas on cod fishing in the baltic sea in an attempt to replenish stocks .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.10.2006 siemens the fall guy in benq insolvency scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq employees feel betrayed by siemens german benq employees and politicians have been putting the blame on siemens for its former mobile phone division 's insolvency , but determining whether the fault lies in munich or taipeh seems to be a matter of opinion . chancellor angela merkel has n't so far pointed any fingers , but she did single out siemens as being responsible for the 3,000 employees who will be out of a job when benq mobile closes shop in germany .
merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

" it is always good to listen to advice from outside and to have someone neutral who does not just have soccer glasses on , " bierhoff said , adding that peters is well regarded for his ability to motivate players . löw should be able to make good use of peters ' skill of dealing with developing players as the soccer coach said he remains committed to the team of young players he helped put together for the world cup . focusing on the next generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw set a goal of winning the 2008 european championships german soccer fans can also expect the trend of new faces in national team jerseys to continue , löw added , saying a fresh team would increase germany 's chances of winning the 2008 european championships in austria and switzerland . löw said he and his scouts are watching a group of 15 to 20 young players and developing performance profiles to track their skills . " we will be making it clear to them that we want to improve them as future national team players in two to four years , " he said . lofty goals for peters ' regional league team peters , 46 , is standing down as german field hockey coach after the 2006 men 's hockey world cup , ending a 22-year association with the german hockey federation that saw him win back-to-back hockey world cup titles with the team in 2002 and 2006 . on oct .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 02.10.2006 a fly-on-the-wall look at germany 's world cup campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director sönke wortmann spent two years with the german national team sönke wortmann 's " germany : a summer 's tale " tells the story of how former german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took a team in disarray to a third-place finish in the world cup . it 's only two-and-a-half months since the 2006 world cup came to an end , but german moviegoers are already getting the chance to relive the excitement .
director sönke wortmann 's eagerly anticipated documentary film " germany : a summer 's tale " premiers on tuesday in berlin , and soccer fans around the country are expected to pack cinemas . wortmann spent two years with the german national squad making the film , enjoying unprecedented access to players and coaches .
the 108-minute documentary has been edited down from more than 100 hours of footage and offers an intimate , behind-the-scenes view of the host nation 's world cup campaign . the film , much of which was shot with a hand-held camera , shows the players in their hotel rooms , on the team bus , on the practice field and in the locker room .
wortmann captures the team 's elation after beating mighty argentina in the tournament 's quarterfinals - and the players ' tears after crashing out against italy in the semis . " i had the feeling that i was so assimilated no one even noticed i was there , " wortmann recalled ahead of the film 's premier oct .
3 . klinsmann as hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german national coach jürgen klinsmann inspired a young and inexperienced squad .
as might be expected , wortmann focuses on the german national squad 's former coach jürgen klinsmann .

those boys love their game with heart and soul and want more than anything to make it big . conductor anu tali and violin soloist maxim vengerov , both under 35 years and with old-school training , are not there to preserve a half-dead musical tradition .
they 're recreating one that breathes new life into the classics instead of exchanging beethoven and friends for the hip avant-garde . " it 's good to be different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim vengerov performed mozart 's concerto no. 4 with finely chiseled tones but new still means different - at least in some ways . " perhaps it 's even simpler being a woman because one if different , " said the conductor , who is petit in stature with cropped blond hair .
" and it 's always good to be different . " nevertheless , she downplays her femininity , taking up the baton sunday evening in a tuxedo complete with tails and a cummerbund .
but her well-earned reputation comes from her high musical standards , not from the novelty of being a female conductor . at the age of 25 , tali founded the estonian-finnish symphony orchestra -lrb- now called the nordic symphony orchestra -rrb- with her twin sister kadri .
their goal ?
to promote cultural understanding between the two countries and cooperation between the world 's leading young musicians . the orchestra gives itself an innovative edge by thematicizing it program each year - this season is all about " legends . " nso 's audiences are young , said tali , in an interview with the beethoven festival .
" we in estonia are trying to find a slightly different way to access the audience . " self-supporting orchestras can survive while in countries like germany the arts are almost entirely funded by the state , the tali twins have managed to finance their orchestra for the last eight years entirely with sponsorships and donations - a precursor of european orchestras in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's beethoven festival is arleady history , but classical music is n't violinist maxim vengerov qualifies as a representative of classical music 's up-and-coming , not only because he 's not yet over the hill himself but also because he 's personally committed to working with children . after being named " ambassador for music " by unicef in 1997 - the first classical musician to get the job - he playing for abducted child-soldiers in uganda , disadvantaged children in harlem , child drug addicts in thailand and kids on both sides of the kosovan ethnic divide . being different is nothing new sunday 's program appeared rather traditional - at first glance .
prokofiev 's symphony no. 1 , mozart 's violin concerto no. 4 , and beethoven 's symphony no. 2 .
for the 21st century , post-post-modern audience it 's easy to forget that these guys were also rebels of sorts . prokofiev 's first symphony -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , dubbed symphonie classique , is a parody of the classical symphony .
the young russian composer , 26 years old at the time , monkeyed with traditional harmonies in some passages , toyed with the form and provoked chuckles from a audience that had lived through the october russian revolution just months before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's bones -lrb- reconstructed here -rrb- are healthier than they may look beethoven 's second symphony was written early in his musical development .
his drastic musical innovations would come a bit later , but the background of the piece is humanly relevant to any generation . the composer was " a great man entering a huge crisis but writing light-hearted , affirmative music - and that while beginning to grow deaf ! " said anu tali .
" people have found memos of his that mention the possibility of suicide but never reached the public eye .
taken altogether , i find it adds up to a very powerful story . " triple overtime for team beethoven tali 's conducting sunday was youthful and energetic but so professional that it 's easy to excuse the parts that may have been a bit too well choreographed , too pre-meditated .
just as for the seasoned center , the spontaneous slam-dunk comes with maturity and experience . with their innovative tendencies , vigor and entrepreneurship , musicians like anu tali , maxim vengerov , and their budding colleagues around the world prove that classical music is alive and well - and not just for its own sake .
the music still has something to say and there are still a few talented individuals who will do anything to say it . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rattle rattles some with a novel approach berlin once welcomed british conductor sir simon rattle enthusiastically as a breath of fresh air .

merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

costs are kept low by outsourcing the lab work to china and germans are cautiously taking the bait . the roughly 90 percent of germans insured under the statutory health system have after recent reforms been forced to pay much more of doctors ' bills out of their own pockets .
this is because the statutory insurers only meet about half of the total costs , and the patients have to pay the rest . the amount the patient has to pay can vary , depending on treatment .
patient-footed bills are particularly high for dental treatment , where the statutory health insurance only covers the run of the mill procedures .
germans who need crowns , bridges , implants or dentures are thus stuck with paying a hefty bill . it 's against this background that a dental discount chain called mczahn - or mctooth - has started operations in germany . mctooth plans nationwide expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies do n't cover all the costs for dental treatment the mctooth dental discount chain started up operations in the western german town of krefeld and is poised to have a total of some 30 branches throughout the country by the end of the year .
it keeps laboratory costs to a minimum by outsourcing all precision work on crowns , bridges and the like to china . for patients , the cheaper cost is the main factor for them to go to mctooth .
dirk frank , one of the discounter 's first patients in germany , said he had been considering seeking dental treatment in poland , where the costs are also considerably lower than in germany . " i ’ d been thinking about going to poland to get my teeth fixed , but then i had doubts about the quality of the dentists ' work there , " frank said .
" and i also knew that follow-up treatment would be a bit tricky .
i have no problem with the mctooth concept . " " the laboratory work is done in china keeping overall costs much lower .
but the quality will be acceptable , because the material for the lab work comes from germany , " he added . another patient , simone kleber , said she was n't sure whether she 'd be satisfied with the treatment .
but she freely admitted that if she did n't give mctooth a try , she 'd never know . " if i 'm not satisfied with the end result , i can easily go back to my old dentist , " she said .
" but it 's worth a try , and you have the same sort of warranty for the chinese lab work .
if anything falls apart , i 'll be back again in no time , believe you me ! " experts fear a decrease in quality care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things might not get this bad but you never know michael knittel from the german dentists ' association believes individual dental care is going to suffer .
" it is essential that the dentist and patient can discuss openly and frankly what sort of treatment would be proper and sensible in each individual case .
this is something patients should remember before jumping at mctooth 's offer . " knittel is referring to the conditions under which dentists join the mctooth chain .
they have to buy into it and become share-holders .
as the scheme is based on the sale of false teeth and dentures , doctors may be overly inclined to talk patients into getting replacements for their natural teeth when in fact alternative treatment would suffice . practitioner 's queuing to join franchise , says chief but mctooth boss werner brandenbusch argues that his dentists are responsible enough to refrain from such practices . and he is delighted with the response he is getting from the dental profession . " the list of dentists wanting to join us is endless , " he said .
" and i 'm not talking about newcomers , but well-established dentists .
they are telling us that they would be afraid of this new powerful competition .
so rather than living their lives in fear , they decide to jump aboard and be part of this exciting new scheme .
we have applicants from all german regions and cities . ” for mctooth customers like dirk frank the chain is a success in terms of savings .
" i have to pay around 1,000 euros for implants , " he said .
" that means altogether i will have saved between 500 and 1,000 euros . "
and the china-made implants are sitting just fine . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online dentistry : health care takes to the net in the search for more affordable dental care , some germans are letting dentists bid at online auction sites for the chance to work in their mouths .

" after reviewing about half a dozen popular seafood dishes , including fried plaice , swordfish or tuna steaks and paella , the conservation group warned that stocks of the basic ingredients were either threatened by over-fishing or were often fished in a manner that produced huge collateral damage . " think carefully before you go and eat cod , swordfish or tuna or plaice , " woolford said . wasteful fishing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a major problem with fishing is waste wwf said that up to 80 percent of some plaice catches in the north sea were thrown back overboard dead or dying , partly because the fish netted were too small . depletion of northern cod stocks , a rival favorite for local dinner tables , has already led to official restrictions on fishing .
the eu has also set about trying to downsize member nations ' fishing fleets . woolford said reforms to the common fisheries policy in the european union outlined three years ago were " rather promising . "
at the same time he said it was ' ' rather alarming " from the wwf 's point of view that there 's still quite a trail of waste and destruction behind european fisheries . the wwf claimed earlier this month that some types of tuna in the mediterranean sea are being illegally fished in excess of international quotas . not enough fish to meet demands woolford , said such a buoyant market has encouraged unsustainable fishing practices . " there are too many boats chasing too few fish , subsidies maintaining the existing size of the european fleet , and a large degree of illegal fishing - we 've seen this with blue-fin tuna in the mediterranean and cod in the baltic , " woolford said . " certainly fish is now much more popular and fashionable than it used to be , " he said .
' ' sixty percent of what 's on european dinner plates comes from outside european waters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fish is appearing more and more on the european plate the report also pointed to illegal driftnet fishing in morocco , which targets swordfish for the european market and catches one swordfish for every two sharks , needlessly killing an estimated 100,000 sharks per year . eu attempts to revive declining fish stocks on sept .
2 , the eu commission proposed a 15 percent cut in quotas on cod fishing in the baltic sea in an attempt to replenish stocks .
european fisheries ministers are due to examine the proposal at a meeting in october . two hundred european boats will be allowed to fish in the region subject to a new two-year ceiling on some types of catches , in exchange for 86 million euros -lrb- 109 million dollars -rrb- in grants for mauritania , including funding for the north african country 's fishing industry . the wwf said consumers should look for fish with a marine stewardship council label , which certifies that the fish has come from a sustainable and well-managed fishery .
some european retailers have begun using the label . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania : the fragile danube delta is under increasing threat before the danube empties into the black sea in romania , the river splits and spreads out , forming the danube delta .

" after reviewing about half a dozen popular seafood dishes , including fried plaice , swordfish or tuna steaks and paella , the conservation group warned that stocks of the basic ingredients were either threatened by over-fishing or were often fished in a manner that produced huge collateral damage . " think carefully before you go and eat cod , swordfish or tuna or plaice , " woolford said . wasteful fishing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a major problem with fishing is waste wwf said that up to 80 percent of some plaice catches in the north sea were thrown back overboard dead or dying , partly because the fish netted were too small . depletion of northern cod stocks , a rival favorite for local dinner tables , has already led to official restrictions on fishing .
the eu has also set about trying to downsize member nations ' fishing fleets . woolford said reforms to the common fisheries policy in the european union outlined three years ago were " rather promising . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 02.10.2006 beethoven 's not just rolling over - he 's alive and well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conductor anu tali has the talent and the initiative to keep classical music alive beethoven and mozart are n't just names on your grandmother 's record shelf and it was no coincidence that this year 's beethoven festival closed sunday with performances by the next generation of classical musicians . anu tali from estonia conducted the closing concert for the 2006 beethoven festival with the kind of sincerity and raw energy that only comes from someone standing at the threshold of her career . after all , college basketball is popular for the very same reason .
those boys love their game with heart and soul and want more than anything to make it big . conductor anu tali and violin soloist maxim vengerov , both under 35 years and with old-school training , are not there to preserve a half-dead musical tradition .
they 're recreating one that breathes new life into the classics instead of exchanging beethoven and friends for the hip avant-garde . " it 's good to be different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim vengerov performed mozart 's concerto no. 4 with finely chiseled tones but new still means different - at least in some ways . " perhaps it 's even simpler being a woman because one if different , " said the conductor , who is petit in stature with cropped blond hair .
" and it 's always good to be different . " nevertheless , she downplays her femininity , taking up the baton sunday evening in a tuxedo complete with tails and a cummerbund .
but her well-earned reputation comes from her high musical standards , not from the novelty of being a female conductor . at the age of 25 , tali founded the estonian-finnish symphony orchestra -lrb- now called the nordic symphony orchestra -rrb- with her twin sister kadri .
their goal ?
to promote cultural understanding between the two countries and cooperation between the world 's leading young musicians . the orchestra gives itself an innovative edge by thematicizing it program each year - this season is all about " legends . " nso 's audiences are young , said tali , in an interview with the beethoven festival .
" we in estonia are trying to find a slightly different way to access the audience . " self-supporting orchestras can survive while in countries like germany the arts are almost entirely funded by the state , the tali twins have managed to finance their orchestra for the last eight years entirely with sponsorships and donations - a precursor of european orchestras in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's beethoven festival is arleady history , but classical music is n't violinist maxim vengerov qualifies as a representative of classical music 's up-and-coming , not only because he 's not yet over the hill himself but also because he 's personally committed to working with children . after being named " ambassador for music " by unicef in 1997 - the first classical musician to get the job - he playing for abducted child-soldiers in uganda , disadvantaged children in harlem , child drug addicts in thailand and kids on both sides of the kosovan ethnic divide . being different is nothing new sunday 's program appeared rather traditional - at first glance .
prokofiev 's symphony no. 1 , mozart 's violin concerto no. 4 , and beethoven 's symphony no. 2 .
for the 21st century , post-post-modern audience it 's easy to forget that these guys were also rebels of sorts . prokofiev 's first symphony -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , dubbed symphonie classique , is a parody of the classical symphony .
the young russian composer , 26 years old at the time , monkeyed with traditional harmonies in some passages , toyed with the form and provoked chuckles from a audience that had lived through the october russian revolution just months before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's bones -lrb- reconstructed here -rrb- are healthier than they may look beethoven 's second symphony was written early in his musical development .
his drastic musical innovations would come a bit later , but the background of the piece is humanly relevant to any generation . the composer was " a great man entering a huge crisis but writing light-hearted , affirmative music - and that while beginning to grow deaf ! " said anu tali .
" people have found memos of his that mention the possibility of suicide but never reached the public eye .
taken altogether , i find it adds up to a very powerful story . " triple overtime for team beethoven tali 's conducting sunday was youthful and energetic but so professional that it 's easy to excuse the parts that may have been a bit too well choreographed , too pre-meditated .
just as for the seasoned center , the spontaneous slam-dunk comes with maturity and experience . with their innovative tendencies , vigor and entrepreneurship , musicians like anu tali , maxim vengerov , and their budding colleagues around the world prove that classical music is alive and well - and not just for its own sake .
the music still has something to say and there are still a few talented individuals who will do anything to say it . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rattle rattles some with a novel approach berlin once welcomed british conductor sir simon rattle enthusiastically as a breath of fresh air .

those boys love their game with heart and soul and want more than anything to make it big . conductor anu tali and violin soloist maxim vengerov , both under 35 years and with old-school training , are not there to preserve a half-dead musical tradition .
they 're recreating one that breathes new life into the classics instead of exchanging beethoven and friends for the hip avant-garde . " it 's good to be different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim vengerov performed mozart 's concerto no. 4 with finely chiseled tones but new still means different - at least in some ways . " perhaps it 's even simpler being a woman because one if different , " said the conductor , who is petit in stature with cropped blond hair .
" and it 's always good to be different . " nevertheless , she downplays her femininity , taking up the baton sunday evening in a tuxedo complete with tails and a cummerbund .
but her well-earned reputation comes from her high musical standards , not from the novelty of being a female conductor . at the age of 25 , tali founded the estonian-finnish symphony orchestra -lrb- now called the nordic symphony orchestra -rrb- with her twin sister kadri .
their goal ?
to promote cultural understanding between the two countries and cooperation between the world 's leading young musicians . the orchestra gives itself an innovative edge by thematicizing it program each year - this season is all about " legends . " nso 's audiences are young , said tali , in an interview with the beethoven festival .
" we in estonia are trying to find a slightly different way to access the audience . " self-supporting orchestras can survive while in countries like germany the arts are almost entirely funded by the state , the tali twins have managed to finance their orchestra for the last eight years entirely with sponsorships and donations - a precursor of european orchestras in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's beethoven festival is arleady history , but classical music is n't violinist maxim vengerov qualifies as a representative of classical music 's up-and-coming , not only because he 's not yet over the hill himself but also because he 's personally committed to working with children . after being named " ambassador for music " by unicef in 1997 - the first classical musician to get the job - he playing for abducted child-soldiers in uganda , disadvantaged children in harlem , child drug addicts in thailand and kids on both sides of the kosovan ethnic divide . being different is nothing new sunday 's program appeared rather traditional - at first glance .
prokofiev 's symphony no. 1 , mozart 's violin concerto no. 4 , and beethoven 's symphony no. 2 .
for the 21st century , post-post-modern audience it 's easy to forget that these guys were also rebels of sorts . prokofiev 's first symphony -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , dubbed symphonie classique , is a parody of the classical symphony .
the young russian composer , 26 years old at the time , monkeyed with traditional harmonies in some passages , toyed with the form and provoked chuckles from a audience that had lived through the october russian revolution just months before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's bones -lrb- reconstructed here -rrb- are healthier than they may look beethoven 's second symphony was written early in his musical development .
his drastic musical innovations would come a bit later , but the background of the piece is humanly relevant to any generation . the composer was " a great man entering a huge crisis but writing light-hearted , affirmative music - and that while beginning to grow deaf ! " said anu tali .
" people have found memos of his that mention the possibility of suicide but never reached the public eye .
taken altogether , i find it adds up to a very powerful story . " triple overtime for team beethoven tali 's conducting sunday was youthful and energetic but so professional that it 's easy to excuse the parts that may have been a bit too well choreographed , too pre-meditated .
just as for the seasoned center , the spontaneous slam-dunk comes with maturity and experience . with their innovative tendencies , vigor and entrepreneurship , musicians like anu tali , maxim vengerov , and their budding colleagues around the world prove that classical music is alive and well - and not just for its own sake .
the music still has something to say and there are still a few talented individuals who will do anything to say it . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rattle rattles some with a novel approach berlin once welcomed british conductor sir simon rattle enthusiastically as a breath of fresh air .

merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.10.2006 siemens the fall guy in benq insolvency scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq employees feel betrayed by siemens german benq employees and politicians have been putting the blame on siemens for its former mobile phone division 's insolvency , but determining whether the fault lies in munich or taipeh seems to be a matter of opinion . chancellor angela merkel has n't so far pointed any fingers , but she did single out siemens as being responsible for the 3,000 employees who will be out of a job when benq mobile closes shop in germany .
merkel had telephoned with siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld on sunday . " i have made clear to siemens that this traditional firm has a special responsibility , " merkel told bild-zeitung daily .
" in view of this overall responsibility , i would welcome it if siemens does everything -lrb- it can -rrb- to give as many employees as possible a future perspective . " siemens said it would set up a 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- fund to help out employees at benq mobile who will likely be jobless come january 1 .
siemens ' managing board also decided to cancel a much-criticized 30 percent pay hike that would have put 5 million more euros into the top executives ' pockets .
the money would instead go into the fund , which would be spent on re-education and further training as well as being paid out in cash to siemens ' former staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld " if benq leaves employees standing in the rain , we want to actively help - and quickly , " kleinfeld told bild , in an effort to save face .
he said the pay hikes for top managers had been warranted but that the situation had changed . " … we want give the people a show of solidarity , " he added .
siemens responsible ?
siemens had paid benq to take over its struggling cell phone division last year , agreeing to pump around 700 million euros into the company .
a siemens spokesman said part of the reason the company sealed the deal with benq was that the asian firm had explicitly shown interest in keeping german locations open .
other interested firms would have closed the munich headquarters and the plants in kamp-linfort and bocholt in north rhine-westphalia , the spokesman said . he stressed that siemens had not gotten rid of the ailing mobile division just to abscond from responsibility for it .
" from today 's point of view , it would have cost us 250-300 million euros to close the german locations . "
handing the division to benq had instead cost siemens 413 million euros , he said . benq mobile declared insolvency on friday , after the taiwanese parent company cut off further investment in the german subsidiary .
ready to bail out ?
a report on monday suggested that benq had consciously planned the mobile division 's demise .
two weeks ago , negotiators for benq had requested that siemens transfer at least 50 million euros in outstanding payments directly to the firm 's taipeh headquarters rather than to the siemens-benq subsidiary in germany as originally intended , süddeutsche zeitung daily wrote .
the negotiators claimed that the payment was necessary due to benq 's overall financial weaknesses .
siemens apparently agreed to advance the payment but not to transfer it to taiwan .
subsequently , benq lost interest in the payment , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq had shown an interest in keeping germany work sites , siemens said but as german politicians from all parties lambasted siemens for the expected loss of 3,000 jobs , the company did n't necessarily deserve all the blame .
there has been widespread agreement that siemens ran its mobile division into the ground through bad management .
the company failed to pick up on market trends , and although siemens mobile was the fifth-biggest hand-set manufacturer in the world in 2005 , it turned in one quarterly loss after another by the time ceo kleinfeld called it quits .
only 100 days into his new position as chief executive , kleinfeld announced in april last year that the search had begun for a way to improve the mobile unit 's fortunes , which he said did not involve selling or scrapping it .
less than six months later , benq became the division 's sole owner .
three months to go however , benq took charge of the mobile unit , and as the financial times deutschland pointed out : " bought is bought . "
benq 's real mistake was allowing siemens to palm off the division on it , the paper wrote .
but by laying the blame on former owner siemens , politicians were giving employees false hopes , since neither benq nor siemens could rescue the cell phone company , it added . insolvency administrator martin prager said over the weekend production at benq mobile would continue until at least the end of the year .
but if the company was not profitable by then , business could not be continued , he added . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nowhere to hide for siemens as hail of criticism increases engineering and electronics giant siemens is facing heavy criticism from all quarters in germany amid accusations it let its mobile phone division die while handing hefty pay rises to top managers .

director sönke wortmann 's eagerly anticipated documentary film " germany : a summer 's tale " premiers on tuesday in berlin , and soccer fans around the country are expected to pack cinemas . wortmann spent two years with the german national squad making the film , enjoying unprecedented access to players and coaches .
the 108-minute documentary has been edited down from more than 100 hours of footage and offers an intimate , behind-the-scenes view of the host nation 's world cup campaign . the film , much of which was shot with a hand-held camera , shows the players in their hotel rooms , on the team bus , on the practice field and in the locker room .
wortmann captures the team 's elation after beating mighty argentina in the tournament 's quarterfinals - and the players ' tears after crashing out against italy in the semis . " i had the feeling that i was so assimilated no one even noticed i was there , " wortmann recalled ahead of the film 's premier oct .
3 . klinsmann as hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german national coach jürgen klinsmann inspired a young and inexperienced squad .
as might be expected , wortmann focuses on the german national squad 's former coach jürgen klinsmann .
when klinsmann took over after the team 's disastrous performance in the 2004 european championship , many germans feared that the squad would embarrass itself on its home soil at the world cup . klinsmann , who lives in california , shook up the team with state-of-the-art fitness training methods and a decidedly american belief in the power of positive thinking .
" germany : a summer 's tale " allows audiences to listen in on the coach 's pre-match motivational speeches , as the team went to exceed all expectations at the world cup . wortmann - whose previous work includes " the miracle of bern " about germany 's victory in the 1954 world cup - himself played lower-division professional soccer , and his love of the game shows .
journalists given the chance to preview the film have been wildly enthusiastic about it . as a special treat , the film reveals one of the most hotly debated secrets from the 2006 world cup - the contents of the note sheet used by goalkeeper jens lehmann during the penalty shoot-out that led to germany 's dramatic victory over argentina . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

the law banning the use of " unconstitutional symbols " needed to be revised , the justice minister told die tageszeitung daily on monday .
should germany 's highest court uphold friday 's ruling by a regional court in stuttgart , there was " something wrong " in the law itself , she said , and the government would be forced to change the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said the government must take action jürgen kamm , the 32-year-old owner of mail order company nix gut versand was fined 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,600 -rrb- for selling anti-nazi t-shirts and badges , a decision he plans to appeal .
the judge ordered the seizure of 16,000 items of merchandise , as well as brochures and flyers bearing the crossed-out swastika logo .
though the items are printed with the swastika , the symbol either has a large red line through it or a fist is shown smashing the symbol .
the logos are popular among left-wing activists and anti-nazi campaigners .
anti-symbol makes swastika acceptable ?
there was a risk that the merchandise could make the swastika socially acceptable again , said district attorney bernhard häussler , the prosecutor in the case against kamm . " all that came to pass under that symbol of nazism was so terrible that any use of it should remain banned from politics , and it should also not be allowed to become a fashion article , " he said .

director sönke wortmann 's eagerly anticipated documentary film " germany : a summer 's tale " premiers on tuesday in berlin , and soccer fans around the country are expected to pack cinemas . wortmann spent two years with the german national squad making the film , enjoying unprecedented access to players and coaches .
the 108-minute documentary has been edited down from more than 100 hours of footage and offers an intimate , behind-the-scenes view of the host nation 's world cup campaign . the film , much of which was shot with a hand-held camera , shows the players in their hotel rooms , on the team bus , on the practice field and in the locker room .
wortmann captures the team 's elation after beating mighty argentina in the tournament 's quarterfinals - and the players ' tears after crashing out against italy in the semis . " i had the feeling that i was so assimilated no one even noticed i was there , " wortmann recalled ahead of the film 's premier oct .
3 . klinsmann as hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german national coach jürgen klinsmann inspired a young and inexperienced squad .
as might be expected , wortmann focuses on the german national squad 's former coach jürgen klinsmann .
when klinsmann took over after the team 's disastrous performance in the 2004 european championship , many germans feared that the squad would embarrass itself on its home soil at the world cup . klinsmann , who lives in california , shook up the team with state-of-the-art fitness training methods and a decidedly american belief in the power of positive thinking .
" germany : a summer 's tale " allows audiences to listen in on the coach 's pre-match motivational speeches , as the team went to exceed all expectations at the world cup . wortmann - whose previous work includes " the miracle of bern " about germany 's victory in the 1954 world cup - himself played lower-division professional soccer , and his love of the game shows .
journalists given the chance to preview the film have been wildly enthusiastic about it . as a special treat , the film reveals one of the most hotly debated secrets from the 2006 world cup - the contents of the note sheet used by goalkeeper jens lehmann during the penalty shoot-out that led to germany 's dramatic victory over argentina . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamm must have thought he was taking steps against neo-nazis under german laws , giving the hitler salute , wearing nazi uniforms or displaying the swastika carries a penalty of up to three years in prison . the court ruling caused a public outcry , including a vehement response from mainstream political leaders . social democratic party chief volker beck said he found it incomprehensible that the rejection of nazi symbols would be equated with the propagation of them .
while independence of the judiciary must be maintained , citizens expected that the legal means by which right-wing extremism can be combated will be taken advantage of , he said on saturday .
berlin demurs green party leader claudia roth , who purposefully provoked a legal investigation into herself for wearing an anti-nazi lapel pin , concurred with zypries that the legislation may need amending .
she said once it became clear how the next court would decide kamm 's case , lawmakers should quickly work to clarify the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth even filed a complaint against herself within the legal community too , there was disagreement with the stuttgart ruling .
berlin will not prosecute the use of the swastika in anti-nazi symbols , the city-state 's senior district attorney , jörg raupach , told the tagesspiegel am sonntag weekly .
the paper wrote that investigators had decided against prosecuting the green party for hanging a flag adorned with a swastika in protest against the stuttgart ruling on the facade their national headquarters in berlin . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol .

those boys love their game with heart and soul and want more than anything to make it big . conductor anu tali and violin soloist maxim vengerov , both under 35 years and with old-school training , are not there to preserve a half-dead musical tradition .
they 're recreating one that breathes new life into the classics instead of exchanging beethoven and friends for the hip avant-garde . " it 's good to be different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim vengerov performed mozart 's concerto no. 4 with finely chiseled tones but new still means different - at least in some ways . " perhaps it 's even simpler being a woman because one if different , " said the conductor , who is petit in stature with cropped blond hair .
" and it 's always good to be different . " nevertheless , she downplays her femininity , taking up the baton sunday evening in a tuxedo complete with tails and a cummerbund .
but her well-earned reputation comes from her high musical standards , not from the novelty of being a female conductor . at the age of 25 , tali founded the estonian-finnish symphony orchestra -lrb- now called the nordic symphony orchestra -rrb- with her twin sister kadri .
their goal ?
to promote cultural understanding between the two countries and cooperation between the world 's leading young musicians . the orchestra gives itself an innovative edge by thematicizing it program each year - this season is all about " legends . " nso 's audiences are young , said tali , in an interview with the beethoven festival .
" we in estonia are trying to find a slightly different way to access the audience . " self-supporting orchestras can survive while in countries like germany the arts are almost entirely funded by the state , the tali twins have managed to finance their orchestra for the last eight years entirely with sponsorships and donations - a precursor of european orchestras in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's beethoven festival is arleady history , but classical music is n't violinist maxim vengerov qualifies as a representative of classical music 's up-and-coming , not only because he 's not yet over the hill himself but also because he 's personally committed to working with children . after being named " ambassador for music " by unicef in 1997 - the first classical musician to get the job - he playing for abducted child-soldiers in uganda , disadvantaged children in harlem , child drug addicts in thailand and kids on both sides of the kosovan ethnic divide . being different is nothing new sunday 's program appeared rather traditional - at first glance .
prokofiev 's symphony no. 1 , mozart 's violin concerto no. 4 , and beethoven 's symphony no. 2 .
for the 21st century , post-post-modern audience it 's easy to forget that these guys were also rebels of sorts . prokofiev 's first symphony -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , dubbed symphonie classique , is a parody of the classical symphony .
the young russian composer , 26 years old at the time , monkeyed with traditional harmonies in some passages , toyed with the form and provoked chuckles from a audience that had lived through the october russian revolution just months before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's bones -lrb- reconstructed here -rrb- are healthier than they may look beethoven 's second symphony was written early in his musical development .
his drastic musical innovations would come a bit later , but the background of the piece is humanly relevant to any generation . the composer was " a great man entering a huge crisis but writing light-hearted , affirmative music - and that while beginning to grow deaf ! " said anu tali .
" people have found memos of his that mention the possibility of suicide but never reached the public eye .
taken altogether , i find it adds up to a very powerful story . " triple overtime for team beethoven tali 's conducting sunday was youthful and energetic but so professional that it 's easy to excuse the parts that may have been a bit too well choreographed , too pre-meditated .
just as for the seasoned center , the spontaneous slam-dunk comes with maturity and experience . with their innovative tendencies , vigor and entrepreneurship , musicians like anu tali , maxim vengerov , and their budding colleagues around the world prove that classical music is alive and well - and not just for its own sake .
the music still has something to say and there are still a few talented individuals who will do anything to say it . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rattle rattles some with a novel approach berlin once welcomed british conductor sir simon rattle enthusiastically as a breath of fresh air .

it is similar to the booker prize in britain , but for novels written in the german language . a contemporary love story in " the have-nots " hacker uses 9/11 as the starting-point for a story about a chance encounter .
a world gone crazy provides the backdrop to this love story about a privileged young couple who have everything but achieve nothing . " i was dealing with the question of how we live , how we should live our lives properly .
whether we can be happy , and how much we should become involved , " said hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of sept .
11 is the background for hacker 's book the author explained that she 'd written the book out of concern for her well-to-do contemporaries .
she wondered why their life style disturbed her so much and was also concerned about her own involvement .
personal responsibility is a central issue to hacker . in " the have-nots " a couple meets at a party in berlin on the day of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
they split up but later the couple meets again by chance in a bar .

costs are kept low by outsourcing the lab work to china and germans are cautiously taking the bait . the roughly 90 percent of germans insured under the statutory health system have after recent reforms been forced to pay much more of doctors ' bills out of their own pockets .
this is because the statutory insurers only meet about half of the total costs , and the patients have to pay the rest . the amount the patient has to pay can vary , depending on treatment .
patient-footed bills are particularly high for dental treatment , where the statutory health insurance only covers the run of the mill procedures .
germans who need crowns , bridges , implants or dentures are thus stuck with paying a hefty bill . it 's against this background that a dental discount chain called mczahn - or mctooth - has started operations in germany . mctooth plans nationwide expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies do n't cover all the costs for dental treatment the mctooth dental discount chain started up operations in the western german town of krefeld and is poised to have a total of some 30 branches throughout the country by the end of the year .
it keeps laboratory costs to a minimum by outsourcing all precision work on crowns , bridges and the like to china . for patients , the cheaper cost is the main factor for them to go to mctooth .
dirk frank , one of the discounter 's first patients in germany , said he had been considering seeking dental treatment in poland , where the costs are also considerably lower than in germany . " i ’ d been thinking about going to poland to get my teeth fixed , but then i had doubts about the quality of the dentists ' work there , " frank said .
" and i also knew that follow-up treatment would be a bit tricky .
i have no problem with the mctooth concept . " " the laboratory work is done in china keeping overall costs much lower .
but the quality will be acceptable , because the material for the lab work comes from germany , " he added . another patient , simone kleber , said she was n't sure whether she 'd be satisfied with the treatment .
but she freely admitted that if she did n't give mctooth a try , she 'd never know . " if i 'm not satisfied with the end result , i can easily go back to my old dentist , " she said .
" but it 's worth a try , and you have the same sort of warranty for the chinese lab work .
if anything falls apart , i 'll be back again in no time , believe you me ! " experts fear a decrease in quality care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things might not get this bad but you never know michael knittel from the german dentists ' association believes individual dental care is going to suffer .
" it is essential that the dentist and patient can discuss openly and frankly what sort of treatment would be proper and sensible in each individual case .
this is something patients should remember before jumping at mctooth 's offer . " knittel is referring to the conditions under which dentists join the mctooth chain .
they have to buy into it and become share-holders .
as the scheme is based on the sale of false teeth and dentures , doctors may be overly inclined to talk patients into getting replacements for their natural teeth when in fact alternative treatment would suffice . practitioner 's queuing to join franchise , says chief but mctooth boss werner brandenbusch argues that his dentists are responsible enough to refrain from such practices . and he is delighted with the response he is getting from the dental profession . " the list of dentists wanting to join us is endless , " he said .
" and i 'm not talking about newcomers , but well-established dentists .
they are telling us that they would be afraid of this new powerful competition .
so rather than living their lives in fear , they decide to jump aboard and be part of this exciting new scheme .
we have applicants from all german regions and cities . ” for mctooth customers like dirk frank the chain is a success in terms of savings .
" i have to pay around 1,000 euros for implants , " he said .
" that means altogether i will have saved between 500 and 1,000 euros . "

the opposition insists he must go . hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany has called for a vote of confidence in the country 's parliament on friday .
but he insisted he would not step down after voters sent his socialist party to a crushing defeat in sunday 's local elections . the election was widely viewed as a referendum on gyurcsany 's government , and the voters spoke loudly and clearly .
the opposition center-right party fidesz defeated gyurcsany 's socialists in 18 out of 19 counties .
the fact that gyurcsany 's junior coalition partners , the free democrats , managed to hold on to the mayor 's office in budapest was small consolation in what amounted to a political debacle . hungary 's independent president laszlo solyom welcomed the decision to call for the vote of confidence .
" things must change , " solyom said .
" now the parliamentary majority has to decide on the future of the prime minister . " the opposition continues to insist that ferenc must leave office . gyurcsany is hoping that a positive vote in the hungarian parliament , where he and his coalition partners have a majority , will allow him to survive politically .
" i also hear the voice of those who believe it is necessary for the parliamentary majority to confirm its trust in the government and in its programme , " gyurcsany said .
" i believe it 's necessary for this political trust to become an authorization . " admission of lying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turn-out was high after gyurcsany admitted lying gyurcsany is unpopular among many hungarians because his government has pursued an austerity program aimed at cutting hungary 's budget deficit from 10.1 to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product by the year 2009 .
but the seeds of his party 's electoral defeat last sunday were really sown in mid-september when a tape recording in which gyurcsany admitted he had lied about the state of the country 's economy was leaked to the press . " we lied , " gyurcsany is heard saying on the tape , " morning , noon and night " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors set cars on fire to express their rage at the government that admission , which was aired repeatedly by the media inside and outside hungary , sparked two weeks of angry and sometimes violent protests outside the parliament building in budapest , with demonstrators demanding that gyurcsany resign . fidesz claims victory fidesz leader and former hungarian prime minister viktor orban said the results of sunday 's vote indicated that hungarians wanted a change in the national government .
" hungarian citizens have replaced the prime minister , " orban claimed after the first vote counts were announced . orban had threatened to call for further mass demonstrations in budapest , if parliament were not given the opportunity to replace the prime minister .
with gyurcsany 's decision to call for a vote of confidence , those plans would now seem to have been put on hold . but should parliament confirm gyurcsany in office , as he expects it to , there may very well be angry protestors back on the streets of budapest . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu warns of " painful " times ahead for hungary hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany rejected opposition calls to quit on tuesday even as the european commission warned that measures required to bring hungary 's ailing economy under control would be " painful .

it is similar to the booker prize in britain , but for novels written in the german language . a contemporary love story in " the have-nots " hacker uses 9/11 as the starting-point for a story about a chance encounter .
a world gone crazy provides the backdrop to this love story about a privileged young couple who have everything but achieve nothing . " i was dealing with the question of how we live , how we should live our lives properly .
whether we can be happy , and how much we should become involved , " said hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of sept .
11 is the background for hacker 's book the author explained that she 'd written the book out of concern for her well-to-do contemporaries .
she wondered why their life style disturbed her so much and was also concerned about her own involvement .
personal responsibility is a central issue to hacker . in " the have-nots " a couple meets at a party in berlin on the day of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
they split up but later the couple meets again by chance in a bar .
they marry , almost in haste , and follow their careers in london . it 's a tense time , in the run-up to the invasion of iraq .
and the couple , seemingly so successful , can only watch as their lives fall apart .
this is the portrait of a generation with no aims . the jury praised hacker for showing how world events can affect the lives of individuals , and how an inability to sympathise and make decisions can clash with a need for ' existential ' experience . frankfurt-born hacker , who is a graduate in philosophy and jewish studies and lived in israel from 1990 until 1996 , currently makes her home in berlin . she first aroused international attention with her novels " the lifeguard " and " morpheus " . german authors dealing with big issues six authors were still in the running when the jury , nominees , press and who ’ s who of germany ’ s literary scene as well as the national book trade gathered for the award ceremony in frankfurt ’ s römer city hall on the night of oct .
2 . the announcement of the winner was carefully timed for the eve of the frankfurt book fair .
all of the shortlisted works dealt with intense issues : terrorism , the division of germany , the bosnian war , the business world , and encounters with foreign cultures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german book prize was founded in 2005 see the link below for a complete list of the shortlisted works and other works by the shortlisted authors that have been published in english . this year ’ s german book prize jury included authors john von düffel and terezia mora , literary critics volker hage , elmar krekeler and pia reinacher , as well as the tv literary editor denis scheck and bookseller stephan samtleben . they had the daunting task of selecting the best novel published in germany , austria and switzerland between oct .
1 , 2005 and sept .
12 , 2006 . " we have read our way through a mountain of novels and even asked for more titles in addition to those nominated by the publishing companies since we did n't want to be limited to the initial choices , " said jury spokesman hage . award in its second year this high-profile fiction competition was founded in 2005 by the german booksellers and publishers association to give contemporary german literature a boost in an increasingly tough overseas market . " the presentation of the german book prize has helped to boost confidence in the quality of contemporary german literature , aroused expectations for the continuation and increased the appetite for new literary discoveries , " said gottfried honnefelder , president of the german booksellers association and chairman of the german book prize academy . last year austrian novelist arno geiger received the prize for his epic family saga " es geht uns gut " -lrb- " we are doing fine " -rrb- , published by hanser . deutsche welle supports the german book prize primarily with media activities abroad . kate cox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : finalists announced for german book prize the search for this year 's best german language novel is underway .

those boys love their game with heart and soul and want more than anything to make it big . conductor anu tali and violin soloist maxim vengerov , both under 35 years and with old-school training , are not there to preserve a half-dead musical tradition .
they 're recreating one that breathes new life into the classics instead of exchanging beethoven and friends for the hip avant-garde . " it 's good to be different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim vengerov performed mozart 's concerto no. 4 with finely chiseled tones but new still means different - at least in some ways . " perhaps it 's even simpler being a woman because one if different , " said the conductor , who is petit in stature with cropped blond hair .
" and it 's always good to be different . " nevertheless , she downplays her femininity , taking up the baton sunday evening in a tuxedo complete with tails and a cummerbund .
but her well-earned reputation comes from her high musical standards , not from the novelty of being a female conductor . at the age of 25 , tali founded the estonian-finnish symphony orchestra -lrb- now called the nordic symphony orchestra -rrb- with her twin sister kadri .
their goal ?
to promote cultural understanding between the two countries and cooperation between the world 's leading young musicians . the orchestra gives itself an innovative edge by thematicizing it program each year - this season is all about " legends . " nso 's audiences are young , said tali , in an interview with the beethoven festival .
" we in estonia are trying to find a slightly different way to access the audience . " self-supporting orchestras can survive while in countries like germany the arts are almost entirely funded by the state , the tali twins have managed to finance their orchestra for the last eight years entirely with sponsorships and donations - a precursor of european orchestras in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's beethoven festival is arleady history , but classical music is n't violinist maxim vengerov qualifies as a representative of classical music 's up-and-coming , not only because he 's not yet over the hill himself but also because he 's personally committed to working with children . after being named " ambassador for music " by unicef in 1997 - the first classical musician to get the job - he playing for abducted child-soldiers in uganda , disadvantaged children in harlem , child drug addicts in thailand and kids on both sides of the kosovan ethnic divide . being different is nothing new sunday 's program appeared rather traditional - at first glance .
prokofiev 's symphony no. 1 , mozart 's violin concerto no. 4 , and beethoven 's symphony no. 2 .
for the 21st century , post-post-modern audience it 's easy to forget that these guys were also rebels of sorts . prokofiev 's first symphony -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , dubbed symphonie classique , is a parody of the classical symphony .
the young russian composer , 26 years old at the time , monkeyed with traditional harmonies in some passages , toyed with the form and provoked chuckles from a audience that had lived through the october russian revolution just months before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's bones -lrb- reconstructed here -rrb- are healthier than they may look beethoven 's second symphony was written early in his musical development .
his drastic musical innovations would come a bit later , but the background of the piece is humanly relevant to any generation . the composer was " a great man entering a huge crisis but writing light-hearted , affirmative music - and that while beginning to grow deaf ! " said anu tali .
" people have found memos of his that mention the possibility of suicide but never reached the public eye .
taken altogether , i find it adds up to a very powerful story . " triple overtime for team beethoven tali 's conducting sunday was youthful and energetic but so professional that it 's easy to excuse the parts that may have been a bit too well choreographed , too pre-meditated .
just as for the seasoned center , the spontaneous slam-dunk comes with maturity and experience . with their innovative tendencies , vigor and entrepreneurship , musicians like anu tali , maxim vengerov , and their budding colleagues around the world prove that classical music is alive and well - and not just for its own sake .
the music still has something to say and there are still a few talented individuals who will do anything to say it . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : rattle rattles some with a novel approach berlin once welcomed british conductor sir simon rattle enthusiastically as a breath of fresh air .

the government has warned doctors some vaccines may not arrive until december due to a production problem and the need to give the most needy jabs first .
the over 65s and people with conditions such as heart disease and diabetes normally get the jab in the autumn .
it is the third year running there have been problems but the government said it was better than first expected .
i am writing to patricia hewitt asking her to issue guidance to gps on how to protect their patients if a flu epidemic strikes and we do not have enough vaccines available andrew lansley , shadow health secretary medical notes : flu the department of health said there should be enough doses in the long-term but some patients would have to wait and that some surgeries in england would have to share stocks .
the same shortage applies to scotland , wales and northern ireland .
but the warning coincides with the start of a national advertising campaign reminding people at risk to get their flu jab .
in the past two years , supplies have run short because of excess demand .
it was particularly acute last year - possibly because of fears over bird flu - and meant some at risk groups did not receive their jabs until after christmas .
cold weather can kill up to 20,000 people a year - a figure which can double in particularly bad winters .
a new flu vaccine has to be produced each year because the virus constantly mutates .
this year there was a problem growing one of the strains which makes up the vaccine , meaning suppliers could not get the vaccine out as quickly as normal .
however , the government has ordered 15.2m doses of the vaccine - a million more than last year when supplies ran out possibly because demand was fuelled by fears over bird flu .
in june , the uk vaccine industry group warned there may be european-wide delays and even shortages due to difficulties growing one of the strains .
dr david salisbury , head of immunisation at the department of health , said at one point it was even thought the production problems could lead to a shortage of vaccines .
at risk groups those aged 65 and over those with a chronic respiratory disease like asthma those with chronic heart disease those with chronic renal disease those with chronic liver disease those with diabetes those with a compromised immune system and those living in long-stay residential care homes or long-stay facilities " while the overall national picture is more positive than we had first thought , the initial delay in production means that delivery of vaccine will be spread over a longer period , " he said .
dr salisbury said in future it be necessary to look at new ways to make the vaccine available .
at present , 97 % of uk supplies go to the nhs , with a small proportion available through retail outlets .
paul rayner , chairman of the uk vaccine industry group , said : " while most surgeries have already received details of their revised delivery schedules , the group advises any surgeries who have not yet received this information to contact their supplier as soon as possible to confirm arrangements . "
' prioritise ' but dr hamish meldrum , chairman of the british medical association 's gps committee , warned that the vulnerable could be put at risk by the delay .
" obviously , the at-risk period for flu outbreaks tends to run from november to march or even april , so even not getting an immunisation until the new year will still help .
" you 're really in the lap of the gods as to whether there might be a flu outbreak in your area before that . "
have your say you 'd think by now that department of health and the flu vacation manufacturers would have got their acts together clive , dartford , kent send us your comments it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against flu .
however , dr meldrum advised patients to wait until they heard from their gp practice , rather than phoning for updates .
shadow health secretary andrew lansley added : " i asked ministers two weeks ago for an update on the supply of flu vaccines for this year , and was assured that 15 million doses would be available .
now we learn that they are not .
" i am writing to patricia hewitt asking her to issue guidance to gps on how to protect their patients if a flu epidemic strikes and we do not have enough vaccines available . "
charities also expressed concern that at-risk groups would not be able to get their jab early .
dr lorna layward , research manager at help the aged , said : " if an older person develops flu before they can get their jabs , the consequences could be potentially life-threatening .
" the government needs to act urgently to ensure that the most vulnerable people get their vaccinations early in order to prevent unnecessary deaths . "

the government has warned doctors some vaccines may not arrive until december due to a production problem and the need to give the most needy jabs first .
the over 65s and people with conditions such as heart disease and diabetes normally get the jab in the autumn .
it is the third year running there have been problems but the government said it was better than first expected .

the same shortage applies to scotland , wales and northern ireland .
but the warning coincides with the start of a national advertising campaign reminding people at risk to get their flu jab .
in the past two years , supplies have run short because of excess demand .
it was particularly acute last year - possibly because of fears over bird flu - and meant some at risk groups did not receive their jabs until after christmas .
cold weather can kill up to 20,000 people a year - a figure which can double in particularly bad winters .
a new flu vaccine has to be produced each year because the virus constantly mutates .
this year there was a problem growing one of the strains which makes up the vaccine , meaning suppliers could not get the vaccine out as quickly as normal .
however , the government has ordered 15.2m doses of the vaccine - a million more than last year when supplies ran out possibly because demand was fuelled by fears over bird flu .
in june , the uk vaccine industry group warned there may be european-wide delays and even shortages due to difficulties growing one of the strains .
dr david salisbury , head of immunisation at the department of health , said at one point it was even thought the production problems could lead to a shortage of vaccines .
at risk groups those aged 65 and over those with a chronic respiratory disease like asthma those with chronic heart disease those with chronic renal disease those with chronic liver disease those with diabetes those with a compromised immune system and those living in long-stay residential care homes or long-stay facilities " while the overall national picture is more positive than we had first thought , the initial delay in production means that delivery of vaccine will be spread over a longer period , " he said .
dr salisbury said in future it be necessary to look at new ways to make the vaccine available .
at present , 97 % of uk supplies go to the nhs , with a small proportion available through retail outlets .
paul rayner , chairman of the uk vaccine industry group , said : " while most surgeries have already received details of their revised delivery schedules , the group advises any surgeries who have not yet received this information to contact their supplier as soon as possible to confirm arrangements . "
' prioritise ' but dr hamish meldrum , chairman of the british medical association 's gps committee , warned that the vulnerable could be put at risk by the delay .
" obviously , the at-risk period for flu outbreaks tends to run from november to march or even april , so even not getting an immunisation until the new year will still help .

however , dr meldrum advised patients to wait until they heard from their gp practice , rather than phoning for updates .

the pittsburgh university team created two baby mice from a fully matured blood cell that itself is incapable of making more of its own kind .
it had been thought only immature stem cells , which can become many types of other cell , were capable of doing this .
a uk expert said the nature genetics study disproved the idea that only immature cells were of use for cloning .
alternative routes somatic cell nuclear transfer -lrb- scnt -rrb- - the scientific term for cloning - is creating an embryo by taking the nucleus , which houses the genetic material of a cell , from one cell and putting it into an unfertilised egg that has had its own genetic material removed .
the resulting embryo is then an exact genetic copy of the cell from the animal or person that donated the nucleus .
types of stem cells embryonic stem cells - derived from embryos that develop from eggs that have been fertilized adult stem cells - immature cells that have yet to fully develop , and found in tissue and organs stem cells are still at an early stage of development , and retain the potential to turn into many different types of cell that make up tissues and organs , which is why experts have heralded their promise for treating a variety of genetic diseases .
but experiments using adult stem cells taken from mature tissue to make early stage embryos have yielded disappointing results , with success rates of 1-5 % .
dr tao cheng and colleagues tested whether a fully matured type of white blood cell , called a granulocyte , could propagate early embryos .
not only was this successful , the granulocyte was far better at this than its immature ancestor cells destined to become granulocytes .
challenging convention between 35 % and 39 % of the mature granulocytes yielded early stage embryos called blastocysts .
in comparison , only 4 % of the immature stem cells could produce blastocysts .
and only the mature , or " differentiated " , granulocytes were able to produce two live cloned mice pups , although both of these died within a few hours of birth .
to check the success of the findings , the scientists also tried cloning using embryonic stem cells - cells taken from blastocysts , rather than using mature tissue to find the donor cells .
up until this the conventional wisdom was that the less mature a cell , the more likely it is to be reprogrammed .
this work suggests the contrary dr stephen minger , from king 's college london nearly 50 % of these yielded blastocysts and 18 cloned pups were born .
however , the use of embryonic stem cells is controversial because opponents argue that all embryos , whether created in the lab or not , are fully fledged humans , and as such it is morally wrong to experiment on them .
scientists have been looking for successful alternatives to embryonic stem cells .
dr cheng said the results clearly showed there was no advantage in using adult stem cells over mature fully differentiated cells .
" we can say with near certainty that a fully differentiated cell such as a granulocyte retains the genetic capacity for becoming like a seed that can give rise to all cell types necessary for the development of an entire organism . "
stem cell expert dr stephen minger , from king 's college london , said : " the findings are quite surprising .
" up until this -lsb- point -rsb- , the conventional wisdom was that the less mature a cell , the more likely it is to be reprogrammed .
this work suggests the contrary .
" certain types of mature cells could be much easier to reprogramme than expected .
" but of course this has only been done in mice and there could be a big difference when it comes to humans .
it would be interesting to see whether the same is found with human cells . "

alternative routes somatic cell nuclear transfer -lrb- scnt -rrb- - the scientific term for cloning - is creating an embryo by taking the nucleus , which houses the genetic material of a cell , from one cell and putting it into an unfertilised egg that has had its own genetic material removed .
the resulting embryo is then an exact genetic copy of the cell from the animal or person that donated the nucleus .
types of stem cells embryonic stem cells - derived from embryos that develop from eggs that have been fertilized adult stem cells - immature cells that have yet to fully develop , and found in tissue and organs stem cells are still at an early stage of development , and retain the potential to turn into many different types of cell that make up tissues and organs , which is why experts have heralded their promise for treating a variety of genetic diseases .
but experiments using adult stem cells taken from mature tissue to make early stage embryos have yielded disappointing results , with success rates of 1-5 % .
dr tao cheng and colleagues tested whether a fully matured type of white blood cell , called a granulocyte , could propagate early embryos .
not only was this successful , the granulocyte was far better at this than its immature ancestor cells destined to become granulocytes .
challenging convention between 35 % and 39 % of the mature granulocytes yielded early stage embryos called blastocysts .
in comparison , only 4 % of the immature stem cells could produce blastocysts .
and only the mature , or " differentiated " , granulocytes were able to produce two live cloned mice pups , although both of these died within a few hours of birth .
to check the success of the findings , the scientists also tried cloning using embryonic stem cells - cells taken from blastocysts , rather than using mature tissue to find the donor cells .
up until this the conventional wisdom was that the less mature a cell , the more likely it is to be reprogrammed .
this work suggests the contrary dr stephen minger , from king 's college london nearly 50 % of these yielded blastocysts and 18 cloned pups were born .
however , the use of embryonic stem cells is controversial because opponents argue that all embryos , whether created in the lab or not , are fully fledged humans , and as such it is morally wrong to experiment on them .
scientists have been looking for successful alternatives to embryonic stem cells .
dr cheng said the results clearly showed there was no advantage in using adult stem cells over mature fully differentiated cells .
" we can say with near certainty that a fully differentiated cell such as a granulocyte retains the genetic capacity for becoming like a seed that can give rise to all cell types necessary for the development of an entire organism . "
stem cell expert dr stephen minger , from king 's college london , said : " the findings are quite surprising .
" up until this -lsb- point -rsb- , the conventional wisdom was that the less mature a cell , the more likely it is to be reprogrammed .
this work suggests the contrary .
" certain types of mature cells could be much easier to reprogramme than expected .
" but of course this has only been done in mice and there could be a big difference when it comes to humans .
it would be interesting to see whether the same is found with human cells . "

september 's quarterly tankan survey of large manufacturers rose to a larger than expected 24 , up from 21 in june .
it measures the percentage of firms saying business conditions are better compared those saying they are worse .
analysts said the improvement had come because of a weaker yen and more optimism about company earnings .
zero rates a lower yen makes japanese exports cheaper and more competitive on world markets , and boosts earnings when dollar transactions are converted back into yen .
the confidence figure of 24 was a two-year high , and raised the prospects of a further hike in interest rates within the next six months .
" this is positive news for the bank of japan and we believe that this can leave room for a rate hike before the end of the year , " said masaaki kanno , chief economist at jp morgan securities .
the bank of japan ended six years of zero interest rates in july when it raised the benchmark rate to 0.25 % .
the zero rate had been introduced in 2001 in an effort to revive the economy , which had been in long-term recession since the early 1990s .
the rate rise signalled the bank 's confidence in the strength of the japanese economy , which has seen accelerating growth and falling unemployment .
however , september 's tankan survey found that japanese companies were more cautious in the outlook for the future , with particular concerns about a slowdown in the us economy - a key export market .

the zero rate had been introduced in 2001 in an effort to revive the economy , which had been in long-term recession since the early 1990s .
the rate rise signalled the bank 's confidence in the strength of the japanese economy , which has seen accelerating growth and falling unemployment .
however , september 's tankan survey found that japanese companies were more cautious in the outlook for the future , with particular concerns about a slowdown in the us economy - a key export market .

how would you choose between funding extra bed spaces , employing more nurses or paying for expensive drugs ?
bbc wales has launched me and my health - a month of programmes that take a closer look at the nhs in wales .
there is also a website that allows users to learn more about how the nhs is run , and make their own decisions about how money should be spent .
" health and our health services are the most important issues in our lives , " explains martyn ingram from bbc wales , " but they are also the most complex . "
nhs organisation in wales 22 local health boards 14 nhs trusts health commission wales what do you think of welsh health services ?
have your say q & a : how the nhs in wales is run quiz : welsh nhs test " through this new initiative we are going to explore all aspects of the issue and hopefully help to inform the debate and the decision making process . "
control of the nhs was devolved to the welsh assembly government in 1999 .
it has since changed the landscape of health authorities , creating 22 local health boards -lrb- lhbs -rrb- responsible for funding local services and 14 nhs trusts , which have the job of treating patients .
more specialised care is organised by health commission wales .
to some it means a structure far too difficult for patients and staff alike to navigate .
" where nhs trusts have to provide services commissioned by more than one local health board it does become too complex and bureaucratic , " says tina donnelly from the royal college of nursing wales . "
when you choose to have smaller organisations , as wales has , you can get the benefit of a strong local focus " kevin sullivan , welsh nhs confederation " its because each lhb might have different requirements and policies and the trust has to meet everyone 's specifications . "
but the whole idea of having so many bodies is too make them accountable to patients .
' perfect size ' kevin sullivan from the welsh nhs confederation argues : " it 's not simply about the number of organisations - a single large organisation can be just as complex and bureaucratic as lots of smaller ones , sometimes more so .
" there is no such thing as the perfect size for a health organisation . "
" but when you choose to have smaller organisations , as wales has , you can get the benefit of a strong local focus . "
chances are , if you 're ill , you wo n't be worrying too much about nhs management structures .
what patients care about is getting fast , effective treatment in the easiest way possible .
during october 2006 , bbc wales will be exploring how well the welsh nhs is performing , and looking at how difficult decisions have to be made every day within the health service .
a programme examining the challenges facing the nhs is being recorded this month .
me and my health - a debate is being broadcast on 25 october , at 2230 , on bbc one wales .

as part of bbc wales ' me and my health series , professor marcus longley , associate director at the university of glamorgan 's welsh institute for health and social care , looks at the structure of the nhs in wales .
who decides how much money the nhs in wales gets , and how it is spent ?
marcus longley says public opinion can bring changes in the nhs at the national level , the welsh assembly decides the size of the nhs budget , from within the total allocation it receives from the chancellor .
the nhs is easily wales ' biggest organisation , with 80,000 staff , and a total budget of £ 4.4bn a year -lrb- up by £ 1.25bn since 2002 -rrb- .
about 80 % of this is allocated to the 22 local health boards -lrb- lhbs -rrb- according to a formula , which gives most money to those parts of wales with the poorest health .
this supports most hospital services .
about 12 % goes on gps , dentists and others in the community .
five per cent is kept back to fund education and training for existing and future staff .
the rest goes on various national public health initiatives and to fund research .
at the local level , therefore , the 22 lhbs are key .
they use their money to decide what the nhs trusts should provide , make the big decisions about the future of local hospitals , and hold the trusts to account .
the 14 nhs trusts are responsible for the day-to-day running of hospital services , for ambulances , and for staff such as district nurses and midwives .
in practice , the boards ' freedom to manoeuvre is circumscribed by , for example : national policy - the assembly 's waiting times targets have to be met national contracts - the national gp contract states what gps can be expected to do the weight of history - the vast majority of budgets are simply rolled over from year to year .
how does change happen in the nhs ?
in part , it is as a result of the assembly making key strategic decisions , and making sure that the lhbs and trusts implement them .
for example , in 2005 it produced a new strategy - designed for life - which sets out various waiting times and other targets , and outlines the wholesale re-design of hospital services which is currently causing so much controversy in north and west wales .
hospitals like uhw in cardiff are managed by nhs trusts in part it is the result of technological change and professional innovation .
new drugs , new ways of providing care , new standards , all demand change from the nhs in wales as they do from health services anywhere in the world .
and in part it is about public opinion .
this can be direct - plans for west wales , for example , are now on ice because of public opposition .
it can also be indirect - politicians know that every four years they 'll find out what people think of their stewardship of the nhs .
so is nhs decision-making fit for purpose ?
there are several answers to this question .
it is relatively efficient - only about four per cent of the total budget goes on management costs .
it is relatively safe - there are lots of checks and balances to make sure that everyone gets an acceptable standard of care .
and the nhs is still a very popular national institution .
paradoxically , the recent financial pressures affecting the service may actually be a sign of relatively good management .
despite the pressures locally caused by rapid growth and nationally-negotiated contracts , in wales they are remarkably small as a percentage of total spend .
but the nhs does struggle to keep up the pace of change .
all that extra investment that has gone in must be matched with newer , better ways of doing things - and the jury 's out on whether that is being achieved .
people must also have confidence that their nhs is being run as it should be - for most of us , the nhs is in effect a monopoly provider , and we will all rely on it at some stage in our lives .

for example , in 2005 it produced a new strategy - designed for life - which sets out various waiting times and other targets , and outlines the wholesale re-design of hospital services which is currently causing so much controversy in north and west wales .
in part it is the result of technological change and professional innovation .
new drugs , new ways of providing care , new standards , all demand change from the nhs in wales as they do from health services anywhere in the world .
and in part it is about public opinion .
this can be direct - plans for west wales , for example , are now on ice because of public opposition .
it can also be indirect - politicians know that every four years they 'll find out what people think of their stewardship of the nhs .
so is nhs decision-making fit for purpose ?
there are several answers to this question .
it is relatively efficient - only about four per cent of the total budget goes on management costs .
it is relatively safe - there are lots of checks and balances to make sure that everyone gets an acceptable standard of care .
and the nhs is still a very popular national institution .
paradoxically , the recent financial pressures affecting the service may actually be a sign of relatively good management .
despite the pressures locally caused by rapid growth and nationally-negotiated contracts , in wales they are remarkably small as a percentage of total spend .
but the nhs does struggle to keep up the pace of change .
all that extra investment that has gone in must be matched with newer , better ways of doing things - and the jury 's out on whether that is being achieved .
people must also have confidence that their nhs is being run as it should be - for most of us , the nhs is in effect a monopoly provider , and we will all rely on it at some stage in our lives .

the coastal city of danang was hardest hit , with hundreds of people injured and thousands of homes destroyed .

the worst of the damage was reported in danang , where the typhoon hit at around 0900 local time -lrb- 0200 gmt -rrb- on saturday .
the cost of damages in danang alone will amount to $ 200m , the authorities estimate , with more than 5,000 houses were washed away , 166,000 damaged and 19 vessels sunk .
" when i returned home , there was nothing left , " said danang resident pham thi thanh .
flooding was also reported in the port town of hoi an , a popular tourist spot , and the huong river was said to be rising in the former imperial capital of hue .
ahead of the storm , authorities had reinforced sea defences and evacuated abut 200,000 residents from vulnerable central areas .

xangsane caused severe damage in the philippines , leaving many roads and bridges impassable .
dozens of people are still missing there .
the typhoon was the strongest to hit the capital , manila , in 11 years , weather officials said .

the coastal city of danang was hardest hit , with hundreds of people injured and thousands of homes destroyed .
the typhoon devastated areas of the philippines last week , killing at least 76 people and leaving millions without power and clean drinking water .
xangsane has now been downgraded to a tropical storm .
' overwhelmed ' four provinces in central vietnam - danang , thua thien-hue , quang nam and quang ngai - bore the brunt of the typhoon .
" the areas in the typhoon 's direct path looked like they were just bombarded by b-52s " nguyen ngoc quang , deputy provincial governor of quang nam , told reporters .
trees were uprooted and roofs blown off houses , while there was concern for fishermen who did not return to port .
electricity and telephone lines were also cut in many areas , with air and train travel disrupted .
the worst of the damage was reported in danang , where the typhoon hit at around 0900 local time -lrb- 0200 gmt -rrb- on saturday .
the cost of damages in danang alone will amount to $ 200m , the authorities estimate , with more than 5,000 houses were washed away , 166,000 damaged and 19 vessels sunk .
" when i returned home , there was nothing left , " said danang resident pham thi thanh .
flooding was also reported in the port town of hoi an , a popular tourist spot , and the huong river was said to be rising in the former imperial capital of hue .
ahead of the storm , authorities had reinforced sea defences and evacuated abut 200,000 residents from vulnerable central areas .
while the typhoon has now been downgraded to a tropical storm , there are still strong risks of landslides and further flooding in the hills .
xangsane caused severe damage in the philippines , leaving many roads and bridges impassable .
dozens of people are still missing there .
the typhoon was the strongest to hit the capital , manila , in 11 years , weather officials said .

income from the accommodation tax , which would be payable by italian tourists too , would have to be spent on tourism structures and services .
cities will be able to apply the tax at certain times of the year , or to exempt places like youth hostels .
italy expects to earn 30bn euros from foreign tourists this year .
further tax hikes " this is not a real tax in the proper sense of the term but a possibility offered to towns and which does not affect residents , " deputy prime minister and minister of tourism francesco rutelli said .
" city authorities in rome , florence and venice are thinking about introducing this tax while others , like naples , are not . "
faced with european union financial commitments that call for a big reduction in italy 's deficit , prime minister prodi 's budget calls for billions of euros in spending cuts and tax hikes , particularly for italy 's big earners .
it proposes raising income tax from 41 % to 43 % for those earning over 75,000 euros a year .
income tax will fall for italians earning less than 40,000 euros .
" i believe that this is a budget that will result in a more just society , that will help the weakest more , " mr prodi said .
observers say he faces a stiff challenge in getting the budget passed by the italian parliament by the end of the year .

the open market homebuy scheme will see the government and selected lenders funding up to 25 % of a property cost .
interest payment start after five years but it should help borrowers afford more expensive property .
borrowers will still have to fund the remaining 75 % of the property cost through a standard mortgage or their own savings .
scheme acceptance we want to help more families get a first step on to the housing ladder yvette cooper , housing minister the scheme will be open to public sector workers and those on council housing waiting lists .
applicants will be assessed by homebuy agents , employed by local housing associations .
once the applicant has been accepted onto the scheme they will have 12.5 % of the property value loaned to them by the government and 12.5 % by a lender , drawn from selected banks and building societies .
this 25 % loan will be interest free for the first five years but if the property is sold the government and lender will be entitled to a share in any increase in its value .
the government said that its portion of the loan will be interest free indefinitely .
the 25 % loan will help the borrower afford a more expensive home than would have been the case if they had had to rely on just a mortgage and their own savings as a deposit .
the concept is excellent but the scale and eligibility -lrb- of the scheme -rrb- falls short of widespread expectations and hopes helen adams , firstrungnow.com the government cited the example of a public sector worker earning £ 35,000 a year .
the worker would be typically entitled to a mortgage of £ 122,500 , with the 25 % homebuy scheme loan on top they could afford a property worth £ 160,000 .
" we want to help more families get a first step on to the housing ladder , " yvette cooper , housing minister said .
" in the long run we need to build more homes to ease the pressure on house prices .
" but in the meantime this new mortgage deal will help thousands of families into a home of their own , " ms cooper added .
surface scratched to date four lenders have signed up for the scheme - nationwide , bank of scotland , morgan stanley advantage , and the yorkshire building society .
the scheme , though , has been criticised as only scratching the surface of the problem of property affordability .
" the concept is excellent but the scale and eligibility -lrb- of the scheme -rrb- falls short of widespread expectations and hopes , " helen adams , managing director of property website firstrungnow.com , told bbc news .
" today 's first time buyers , unless they can be described as a key worker will still need to look for a solution amongst the array of new property and mortgage ' deals ' being offered or go cap in hand to their parents , " she added .
housing target the open market homebuy scheme will run alongside the already existing homebuy scheme .
broadly , the existing homebuy scheme helps key workers buy up to 75 % of the value of a property , with a registered social landlord or property developer owning the remaining stake to whom they pay rent .
since homebuy started in 1999 , 40,000 people have been helped to buy part of their own property with the government targeting another 100,000 for help by 2010 .
but in july a report from the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- said the government needs to improve the efficiency of its shared ownership home buying schemes .
only 11,000 households were helped by the homebuy schemes in 2004-05 even though 60,000 applied .

she had been through breast cancer seven years earlier , had the surgery , the chemo , the radiotherapy and , as she thought , put it all behind her .
but she still knew what it was like to feel the icy fear that the cancer was back at the slightest ache .
luck was on her side .
her tests were clear .
it was a reprieve - a second chance - and she grabbed it hard with both hands .
" i had to do something to take away the fear , " she said .
" i 'm a speech and drama teacher , i 'm a showgirl and i thought i 'd use those gifts . "
the spark for derry 's own set of calendar girls was lit .
the original calendar girls were the ladies of rylstone and district women 's institute , photographed tastefully in the nude for a calendar to raise money for leukaemia research .
their idea snowballed , hollywood called and helen mirren and julie waters played starring roles .
sandra took the idea but put her own slant on it .
she found 10 other women from derry aged from 42 to 68 who had all been through breast cancer and survived .
some of them were treated nearly 20 years ago , some just two .
she wanted them to pose nude for a calendar ... just the way the original calendar girls did .
on sunday , the women took to the stage of the millennium forum in derry to launch their calendar .
they want to raise money for the breast care unit at derry 's altnagelvin hospital and the marie keating foundation in the republic .
but more than that , they want to send out a message of hope to all those who find themselves thrown into that dark tunnel of a cancer diagnosis .
all the women have had some kind of treatment ... lumpectomies , mastectomies , reconstructive work , chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
but they bared their souls as they bared their bodies and their message was : " we 're still here and we 're still beautiful . "
it took persuasion .
women of a certain age are reluctant at the best of times to take off their clothes .
over 40 is the age of the big pants .
" it was like a catching a fish , " sandra explained .
she threw out the worm of the idea , hooked the other women 's interest , then reeled them all in ... throwing caution , modesty and a whole heap of underwear to the wind .
" you do n't say no to sandra biddle , " joked one of the alternative calendar girls .
others said ' derry 's answer to oprah winfrey ' would never take no for an answer .
carita kerr , former lady mayoress of derry , was among the women whom sandra called .
" when sandra rang and talked about doing a bit of fundraising , i was all for it , " she said .
" i pictured myself shaking a collection box in the middle of derry .
but then she mentioned a calendar ... "
there was a momentary hesitation , long enough for a penny to drop to the bottom of a round plastic collection box , but carita 's mind was made up .
" let 's go for it ! " she said .
and they did .
on 13 june , they gathered for a photo shoot at andrea o 'hare 's studio and prepared to bare all .
the city of derry was behind them .
the ladies were treated to limousines , beauty treatments and champagne to relax them .
andrea , an award winning fuji photographer took the calendar pictures .
what sandra did n't know when she approached her to take the photographs was that she , too , had had a brush with breast cancer .
" she rang and asked would i be interested in taking pictures in the nude .
i put it down as a crank call to begin with , " said andrea .
but when the idea was explained , she gave her support to the project .
the women describe her as the " 12th honorary calendar girl " ... she stayed firmly behind the camera lens , but was with them all the way .
each woman has her story to tell .
attracta bradley , miss january , was open about her cancer .
no wig for her , she went to town with a bald head and started a trend for baseball hats .
she chose to be photographed with two suitcases because she believes life is about living out your dreams , and hers is travelling .
each woman chose her theme .

eleven cancer survivors took part in the project - pic studio red i enlarge image she had been through breast cancer seven years earlier , had the surgery , the chemo , the radiotherapy and , as she thought , put it all behind her .
but she still knew what it was like to feel the icy fear that the cancer was back at the slightest ache .
luck was on her side .
her tests were clear .
it was a reprieve - a second chance - and she grabbed it hard with both hands .
" i had to do something to take away the fear , " she said .
" i 'm a speech and drama teacher , i 'm a showgirl and i thought i 'd use those gifts . "
the spark for derry 's own set of calendar girls was lit .
the original calendar girls were the ladies of rylstone and district women 's institute , photographed tastefully in the nude for a calendar to raise money for leukaemia research .
their idea snowballed , hollywood called and helen mirren and julie waters played starring roles .
sandra took the idea but put her own slant on it .
she found 10 other women from derry aged from 42 to 68 who had all been through breast cancer and survived .
some of them were treated nearly 20 years ago , some just two .
she wanted them to pose nude for a calendar ... just the way the original calendar girls did .
elaine doherty was pictured on roses to reflect her love for life on sunday , the women took to the stage of the millennium forum in derry to launch their calendar .
they want to raise money for the breast care unit at derry 's altnagelvin hospital and the marie keating foundation in the republic .
but more than that , they want to send out a message of hope to all those who find themselves thrown into that dark tunnel of a cancer diagnosis .
all the women have had some kind of treatment ... lumpectomies , mastectomies , reconstructive work , chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
but they bared their souls as they bared their bodies and their message was : " we 're still here and we 're still beautiful . "
it took persuasion .
women of a certain age are reluctant at the best of times to take off their clothes .
over 40 is the age of the big pants .
" it was like a catching a fish , " sandra explained .
she threw out the worm of the idea , hooked the other women 's interest , then reeled them all in ... throwing caution , modesty and a whole heap of underwear to the wind .
" you do n't say no to sandra biddle , " joked one of the alternative calendar girls .
others said ' derry 's answer to oprah winfrey ' would never take no for an answer .
carita kerr , former lady mayoress of derry , was among the women whom sandra called .
sandra biddle was inspired by the original calendar girls " when sandra rang and talked about doing a bit of fundraising , i was all for it , " she said .
" i pictured myself shaking a collection box in the middle of derry .
but then she mentioned a calendar ... "
there was a momentary hesitation , long enough for a penny to drop to the bottom of a round plastic collection box , but carita 's mind was made up .
" let 's go for it ! " she said .
and they did .
on 13 june , they gathered for a photo shoot at andrea o 'hare 's studio and prepared to bare all .
the city of derry was behind them .
the ladies were treated to limousines , beauty treatments and champagne to relax them .
andrea , an award winning fuji photographer took the calendar pictures .
what sandra did n't know when she approached her to take the photographs was that she , too , had had a brush with breast cancer .
" she rang and asked would i be interested in taking pictures in the nude .
i put it down as a crank call to begin with , " said andrea .
former mayoress carita kerr joined in the project but when the idea was explained , she gave her support to the project .
the women describe her as the " 12th honorary calendar girl " ... she stayed firmly behind the camera lens , but was with them all the way .
each woman has her story to tell .
attracta bradley , miss january , was open about her cancer .
no wig for her , she went to town with a bald head and started a trend for baseball hats .
she chose to be photographed with two suitcases because she believes life is about living out your dreams , and hers is travelling .
each woman chose her theme .

but she still knew what it was like to feel the icy fear that the cancer was back at the slightest ache .
luck was on her side .
her tests were clear .
it was a reprieve - a second chance - and she grabbed it hard with both hands .
" i had to do something to take away the fear , " she said .
" i 'm a speech and drama teacher , i 'm a showgirl and i thought i 'd use those gifts . "
the spark for derry 's own set of calendar girls was lit .
the original calendar girls were the ladies of rylstone and district women 's institute , photographed tastefully in the nude for a calendar to raise money for leukaemia research .
their idea snowballed , hollywood called and helen mirren and julie waters played starring roles .
sandra took the idea but put her own slant on it .
she found 10 other women from derry aged from 42 to 68 who had all been through breast cancer and survived .
some of them were treated nearly 20 years ago , some just two .
she wanted them to pose nude for a calendar ... just the way the original calendar girls did .
elaine doherty was pictured on roses to reflect her love for life on sunday , the women took to the stage of the millennium forum in derry to launch their calendar .
they want to raise money for the breast care unit at derry 's altnagelvin hospital and the marie keating foundation in the republic .
but more than that , they want to send out a message of hope to all those who find themselves thrown into that dark tunnel of a cancer diagnosis .
all the women have had some kind of treatment ... lumpectomies , mastectomies , reconstructive work , chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
but they bared their souls as they bared their bodies and their message was : " we 're still here and we 're still beautiful . "
it took persuasion .
women of a certain age are reluctant at the best of times to take off their clothes .
over 40 is the age of the big pants .
" it was like a catching a fish , " sandra explained .
she threw out the worm of the idea , hooked the other women 's interest , then reeled them all in ... throwing caution , modesty and a whole heap of underwear to the wind .
" you do n't say no to sandra biddle , " joked one of the alternative calendar girls .
others said ' derry 's answer to oprah winfrey ' would never take no for an answer .
carita kerr , former lady mayoress of derry , was among the women whom sandra called .
sandra biddle was inspired by the original calendar girls " when sandra rang and talked about doing a bit of fundraising , i was all for it , " she said .
" i pictured myself shaking a collection box in the middle of derry .
but then she mentioned a calendar ... "
there was a momentary hesitation , long enough for a penny to drop to the bottom of a round plastic collection box , but carita 's mind was made up .
" let 's go for it ! " she said .
and they did .
on 13 june , they gathered for a photo shoot at andrea o 'hare 's studio and prepared to bare all .
the city of derry was behind them .
the ladies were treated to limousines , beauty treatments and champagne to relax them .
andrea , an award winning fuji photographer took the calendar pictures .
what sandra did n't know when she approached her to take the photographs was that she , too , had had a brush with breast cancer .
" she rang and asked would i be interested in taking pictures in the nude .
i put it down as a crank call to begin with , " said andrea .
former mayoress carita kerr joined in the project but when the idea was explained , she gave her support to the project .
the women describe her as the " 12th honorary calendar girl " ... she stayed firmly behind the camera lens , but was with them all the way .
each woman has her story to tell .
attracta bradley , miss january , was open about her cancer .
no wig for her , she went to town with a bald head and started a trend for baseball hats .
she chose to be photographed with two suitcases because she believes life is about living out your dreams , and hers is travelling .
each woman chose her theme .
carita kerr , an opera singer , found a cello was just large enough to cover her modesty .
props and smiles kate o 'dooher chose to have her picture taken with a baby because six years ago , when she was diagnosed , she thought she would n't live to see any of her grandchildren ... she did .
miss march , elaine doherty , is pictured on a bed of roses because she loves life now , she lives for the moment .
attracta reid chose a pretty parasol to hide behind , jane cregan just wanted to show there was life after cancer and miss july , mary sharkey 's message to the world is : " life is not a rehearsal , enjoy it ! "
anne harvey jenner covered her modesty with a few well placed autumn leaves and tess coyle , miss october hid behind a picture of audrey hepburn whom she adores .
it is 18 years since tess was diagnosed .
she has known sandra since she was a child .
what sandra forgot to tell her was that the calendar pictures involved stripping off .
" i only found that out on the morning of the photo-shoot , " she laughed ... there was no going back .
miss november , rhona lavery chose jewellery , fur and most importantly a smile for her photograph .
they are all women of hope .
their calendar which costs £ 8 , or 10 euro in the republic of ireland , will be sold in veritas shops and marks & spencer stores throughout ireland to raise money for altnagelvin hospital 's breast care unit in derry and the marie keating foundation in the republic .

by opening up the code yahoo hopes to help create a series of innovative ways to deal with e-mail messages .
eventually it said there could be " tens of thousands " of add-ons and extras for the e-mail reader .
yahoo is only the latest of the big web companies to open up their main services to the wider code developing community .
mail man although yahoo plans to keep control of the code that deals with user names and passwords , programmers will be able to tinker with almost every other part of the e-mail reading program .
yahoo mail has more than 257 million registered accounts .
the initiative could result in new looks for the yahoo e-mail reader , innovative ways to display messages to get a quick idea of message contents or a series of add-ons that do more with the information found in mail messages .
" yahoo is a very large company but we ca n't build every application that a user might want , " chad dickerson , head of yahoo 's software developer relations , told the reuters news agency .

the siemens executives will instead donate the money to a hardship fund for staff at benq mobile , the unit bought by taiwanese firm benq last year .
siemens ' move comes after benq mobile filed for insolvency last week after benq said it would withdraw funding .
benq mobile has continued to lose both money and market share .
this is despite benq investing 840m euros -lrb- $ 1bn ; £ 570m -rrb- in the germany-headquartered unit since it bought the business in the summer of 2005 .
' unacceptable ' siemens said its senior managers would be donating 35m euros to the hardship fund for benq mobile staff .
" we find benq 's course of action in germany unacceptable and are helping as much as we can , " siemens chief executive klaus kleinfeld told german newspaper bild zeitung .
" if benq leaves the staff standing in the rain , we want to help actively and energetically , and indeed fast . "
despite mr kleinfeld 's strong words against benq , critics of siemens say the firm was wrong to sell off its loss-making mobile phone unit in the first place .
they say the german industrial conglomerate should have tried to turn the mobile phone business around itself instead of washing its hands of the unit .
benq mobile 's products are labelled benq-siemens .
its german workforce have held protests since the insolvency move was announced .
