" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" to open the german broadband markets to competition will lead to better services and lower internet prices for consumers , " said viviane reding , the eu telecommunications commissioner , in a statement . in a letter sent today to the german telecoms regulator , the bu n des n etzage n tur , the commission asked that the proposals be implemented " without further delay . "
it could force deutsche telekom , which is 31.3-percent owned by the germany government , to make broadband internet access available to competitors by the end of the year . broadband internet connections make possible data-heavy computer applications such as music , video and phone calls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is not anxious to open up its network if rivals do take up the offer , it would almost certainly result in lower prices for consumers .
deutsche telekom customers pay around 40 euros -lrb- $ 51.24 -rrb- per month for unlimited broadband service while customers of the british telecoms operator bt pay as little as $ 18.72 per month for similar service . in july 2003 , the commission passed a directive requiring member states to compel dominant former telecoms monopolies to sell wholesale access to competitors at the bitstream level , which would give them the ability to offer the same phone and data services at the network owners at competitive prices .
all 25 member states have complied except germany . the prices new entrants to the market would pay for this access would be set by the german regulator . " overregulatio n " a spokesman for deutsche telekom , mark nierwetberg , told bloomberg that the ruling is " a classic example of overregulation . "
he said that the company 's rivals have a bigger share of the broadband market in germany than other former monopolies in other countries and their rivals . the telecoms giant has argued that it needs exclusive use of the network in order to recoup its investment . deutsche telekom controls a large majority of broadband connections in germany . eu commission reding criticized the time it has taken for germany to act on this issue , saying it has been three years since the eu telecoms directive came into force but the german network regulator is only now beginning to take action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .

" merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment . " germany is no longer the sick man of europe , " she said .
" i think we have turned the corner . " data released last week showed that the german economy grew by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , its fastest pace in more than five years . " i 'm thoroughly convinced that we will break out of the circle of spiraling debt in the next few months , " she said , adding that germany is on track to meet eu regulations of limiting new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . merkel said she plans to continue the reform process started by her predecessor , gerhard schröder - who she credited with taking steps to cut german unemployment - by alleviating the tax burden for small and medium-sized businesses and intensifying efforts to scrap bureaucracy . germa n y 's fight agai n st terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans may have to get used to seeing more cameras watching public spaces germany is also faced with a new task of fighting terrorism at home after two suitcase bombs were discovered on local trains at the end of july , merkel said . she called for additional video surveillance in train stations after recordings helped authorities find and arrest one of two men suspected of planting bombs on the trains headed to the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " we will of course have to draw the necessary consequences regarding the events in kiel and the planned attacks on the railway , " she said , mentioning the city where the first suspect was arrested .
" certainly no one will claim that the video surveillance is not an important thing . " in light of the failed german rail attacks , merkel also said germany needs to expedite the implementation of a database to help identify and track terror suspects in germany . back i n to the political fray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of foreign and domestic issues are waiting for politicians ' attention since going on vacation , merkel has had to watch germans ' approval of her slide downward to a record low of about 30 percent . what seems to rankle most with german voters , pollsters said , is her inability to come up with reforms that are convincing and to forge agreement with her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- junior partners without a major debate . merkel , however , had words of praise for spd head kurt beck , dismissed claims of too much bickering within the ruling grand coalition and vowed to press ahead with her political course . " i 'm not going to bother with opinion polls , " she said .
" the political course we 've adopted is right , and i 'm convinced it will make this government a success .
we have been and will remain truthful to the people about what we are going to do and this will pay off in the future . " gü n ter grass ' belated apology merkel even found time during the press conference to criticize nobel literature laureate günter grass for admitting to being a member of the nazi army 's waffen ss . " i wish we had been informed of his biography in entirety from the beginning , " she said .
" i am not surprised at the widespread criticism over the late revelation of this biographical fact because grass never held back in speaking his mind on other issues .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.08.2006 germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are used to their army deployed abroad , but the mideast is a different matter after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .
but it is desperate to avoid a situation in which its troops would have to fire on israeli soldiers . the prospect of germany 's first military foray in the middle east since world war ii is viewed with trepidation by political leaders and is deeply unpopular among the german public which fears a bloody quagmire . but chancellor angela merkel said germany had no choice but to participate in the mission to secure a shaky un-brokered ceasefire between hezbollah and israel after a month of fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany has no choice but to participate in the mission if germany bowed out , " the government would see its influence wane dramatically in terms of shaping its foreign policy , " she said . no ground troops or police but merkel has firmly ruled out the deployment of combat troops in an effort to contain the risk of a direct confrontation with israel , where memories of german aggression are still fresh among holocaust survivors . on sunday , merkel also ruled out sending german police to the region . there has been speculation that german police would help to secure lebanon 's borders with syria and israel but merkel said germany 's role would be to advise lebanese security forces on how to carry out the job . " as far as securing the airports and the borders is concerned , germany 's interest is to advise and to train the lebanese security forces .
the borders will be protected by lebanese soldiers or police . " she reiterated that germany planned to send a small navy unit to help secure lebanon 's coastal waters . " we are prepared to send a compact marine unit to secure the seaways off the lebanese coast , " she said .
" of course the conditions for the engagement still need to be clarified , " she added .
merkel underlined that germany 's involvement hinged on getting parliamentary approval for the deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is prepared to send medical mobile units to southern lebanon berlin however has already said it is prepared to send mobile medical units and transport planes to southern lebanon .
this falls under humanitarian aid and does not require parliamentary approval . tricky foreign policy challenge the top-selling newspaper bild recently called the issue of whether to deploy german troops in the middle east " the trickiest question german foreign policy has ever faced . " although jewish leaders had recently expressed serious reservations about a german mission in the middle east , the leader of germany 's main jewish group said she saw german participation as a defense of israel 's sovereignty . " germany and israel are allied countries , " charlotte knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " germany already has about 7,700 soldiers overseas serving in international peacekeeping forces , mainly in the balkans , afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo . but a poll released friday found that a solid majority - 58 percent - opposed any german participation in the un force in lebanon . about one in four - 26 percent - said they would support a german role if there were a firm guarantee that german soldiers would not confront israeli troops in battle , according to the poll for zdf public television conducted last week . the end of an " artificial taboo ? " " the risks are so incalculable that i do not think that the time is ripe for any peacekeeping force , with german involvement or not , " the director of the german-orient institute in hamburg , udo steinbach , told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldiers return to israel after a ceasefire was called last week steinbach said diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting truce between israel and hezbollah had a long way to go before a un force would have a peace to keep , saying the situation in the border region was still " highly explosive .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2006 italy asked by israel to lead peacekeeping force in lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un peacekeeping mission will be stepped up to some 15,000 troops israeli prime minister ehud olmert has asked italy to lead the united nations peacekeeping force in lebanon to enforce a fragile ceasefire , which is entering its second week . olmert made the request in a telephone conversation sunday with italian prime minister romano prodi , according to a statement released by the israeli prime minister 's office . " it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" at the moment there is too much talk about the military component and not enough about the long-term political process . " merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment . " germany is no longer the sick man of europe , " she said .
" i think we have turned the corner . " data released last week showed that the german economy grew by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , its fastest pace in more than five years . " i 'm thoroughly convinced that we will break out of the circle of spiraling debt in the next few months , " she said , adding that germany is on track to meet eu regulations of limiting new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . merkel said she plans to continue the reform process started by her predecessor , gerhard schröder - who she credited with taking steps to cut german unemployment - by alleviating the tax burden for small and medium-sized businesses and intensifying efforts to scrap bureaucracy . germa n y 's fight agai n st terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans may have to get used to seeing more cameras watching public spaces germany is also faced with a new task of fighting terrorism at home after two suitcase bombs were discovered on local trains at the end of july , merkel said . she called for additional video surveillance in train stations after recordings helped authorities find and arrest one of two men suspected of planting bombs on the trains headed to the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " we will of course have to draw the necessary consequences regarding the events in kiel and the planned attacks on the railway , " she said , mentioning the city where the first suspect was arrested .
" certainly no one will claim that the video surveillance is not an important thing .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .
one hopes that for the congolese , because right now , there is no other choice . alexa n der göbel is a n africa expert with deutsche welle radio .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

but it is desperate to avoid a situation in which its troops would have to fire on israeli soldiers . the prospect of germany 's first military foray in the middle east since world war ii is viewed with trepidation by political leaders and is deeply unpopular among the german public which fears a bloody quagmire . but chancellor angela merkel said germany had no choice but to participate in the mission to secure a shaky un-brokered ceasefire between hezbollah and israel after a month of fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany has no choice but to participate in the mission if germany bowed out , " the government would see its influence wane dramatically in terms of shaping its foreign policy , " she said . no ground troops or police but merkel has firmly ruled out the deployment of combat troops in an effort to contain the risk of a direct confrontation with israel , where memories of german aggression are still fresh among holocaust survivors . on sunday , merkel also ruled out sending german police to the region . there has been speculation that german police would help to secure lebanon 's borders with syria and israel but merkel said germany 's role would be to advise lebanese security forces on how to carry out the job . " as far as securing the airports and the borders is concerned , germany 's interest is to advise and to train the lebanese security forces .
the borders will be protected by lebanese soldiers or police . " she reiterated that germany planned to send a small navy unit to help secure lebanon 's coastal waters . " we are prepared to send a compact marine unit to secure the seaways off the lebanese coast , " she said .
" of course the conditions for the engagement still need to be clarified , " she added .
merkel underlined that germany 's involvement hinged on getting parliamentary approval for the deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is prepared to send medical mobile units to southern lebanon berlin however has already said it is prepared to send mobile medical units and transport planes to southern lebanon .
this falls under humanitarian aid and does not require parliamentary approval . tricky foreign policy challenge the top-selling newspaper bild recently called the issue of whether to deploy german troops in the middle east " the trickiest question german foreign policy has ever faced . " although jewish leaders had recently expressed serious reservations about a german mission in the middle east , the leader of germany 's main jewish group said she saw german participation as a defense of israel 's sovereignty . " germany and israel are allied countries , " charlotte knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " germany already has about 7,700 soldiers overseas serving in international peacekeeping forces , mainly in the balkans , afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo . but a poll released friday found that a solid majority - 58 percent - opposed any german participation in the un force in lebanon . about one in four - 26 percent - said they would support a german role if there were a firm guarantee that german soldiers would not confront israeli troops in battle , according to the poll for zdf public television conducted last week . the end of an " artificial taboo ? " " the risks are so incalculable that i do not think that the time is ripe for any peacekeeping force , with german involvement or not , " the director of the german-orient institute in hamburg , udo steinbach , told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldiers return to israel after a ceasefire was called last week steinbach said diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting truce between israel and hezbollah had a long way to go before a un force would have a peace to keep , saying the situation in the border region was still " highly explosive . " however , if the force 's mandate were revised and its chances of success boosted by bringing nations such as syria on board , he said it would be only natural for germany to play a role . " participation in this force would mean -lrb- germany -rrb- acting like a normal country in the middle east , with all the risks that entails , " he said . henning riecke , an analyst at the german council on foreign relations , said involvement in a un force would mark the end of an " artificial taboo " because the postwar german army had already embarked on deployments abroad in the 1990s . " the bundeswehr is already present around the world and that is largely accepted by the german people , " he told afp . " in two or three years we will have forgotten the debate about german participation and will be talking about the difficulty the force is having in accomplishing its goals .

" at the moment there is too much talk about the military component and not enough about the long-term political process . " merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment . " germany is no longer the sick man of europe , " she said .

" at the moment there is too much talk about the military component and not enough about the long-term political process . " merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment .

steinmeier 's comments , therefore , were far from redundant . germany 's top diplomat began a three-day visit to the insurgency-wracked country late on sunday , his first to afghanistan , during which he will meet with president hamid karzai and other officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will get his first taste of afghanistan steinmeier will also visit germany 's military bases in the northern cities of mazar-i-sharif , kunduz and faizabad where some 2,850 german troops are based as part of the nato-led international stability and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .

" the increase of attacks with ied , and also the increase in attacks on our soldiers with rocket launchers and also suicide bombings , have given our mission a serious and dangerous new quality , " jung said at the time . reconstruction efforts under threat the considerable efforts of the taliban to disrupt the reconstruction of afghanistan means that there are few successes of note but some progress has been made in the past four years of international assistance , with a number of new schools and irrigation programs testament to the perseverance of all those involved in getting the country back on its feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban fight back however , that progress is now more in danger than at any other time since the hard line islamist regime was ousted .
the return of the taliban , the exploding drug trade and increasing corruption provide afghanistan , the fifth-poorest country in the world , with gigantic problems . but for germany there is no alternative to remaining committed to the reconstruction program .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .
one hopes that for the congolese , because right now , there is no other choice . alexa n der göbel is a n africa expert with deutsche welle radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 21.08.2006 opinion : critical period in the democratic republic of congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the first free elections in dr congo in 40 years , no one received an absolute majority and a run-off will take place .
now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german palace of the republic is slowly disappearing the so-called palast der republik , or palace of the republic , which housed the former communist parliament and served as an entertainment venue for the select masses , already stands stripped to the girder .
passersby can see pieces of sky through the waning skeleton , which will completely disappear by next year - if workers do n't find even more asbestos , that is . after an earlier decontamination operation that cost millions , the cancer-causing building material has again surfaced during the dismantling and could stretch the palace 's removal to 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1993 , supporters of the imperial palace set up a mock version to get people 's attention it 's yet another twist and delay in the saga surrounding the space 's future that began soon after germany 's reunification in 1990 .
on the one side of the debate stood those calling for the preservation of the proletarian palace ; on the other were proponents of reconstructing berlin 's imperial palace , which was severely damaged during world war ii and demolished by the east german regime in 1950 . the latter group won the backing of germany 's parliament , which supports building a cultural and scientific center .
situated vis-a-vis the city 's world-famous museum island and named after german researcher alexander von humboldt , the humboldt forum would house berlin 's non-european art collections , nearby humboldt university 's science collections as well as parts of berlin 's central library .
an entertainment and convention center would compliment the complex , which would be modern on the inside while coated with the imperial palace 's historic facade . gree n space vs. you n g art but according to government officials , the palace 's reconstruction - not least for financial reasons - wo n't begin before 2012 .
a green space is meant to fill the void in the interim .
before the best landscape proposals can be unveiled in september , the makers of berlin art magazine mo n opol recently presented an alternative idea : a temporary museum featuring the works of young artists . bildunterschrift : graft architects , known for redesigning us actor brad pitt 's home , propose housing the temporary museum in an organic " cloud " structure " we want to let contemporary art meet contemporary architecture , " ingolf kern , one of the magazine 's editors , said after architects from the firms of schneider + schumacher , graft , gmp , bottega + erhardt and sauerbruch hutton unveiled their sketches for a museum . supporters of the project , including former german culture minister christina weiss , say that the space is too prominent to let it sit vacant for several years .
but city officials give the temporary museum little chance of becoming reality . bildunterschrift : a proposal to build a temporary labyrinth in the square might already be taking things too far for berlin city officials " we want to use as little tax money as possible and still create a place that is accepted by the public , " said petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department .
" an art museum would contradict this ... there 's certainly no plan to put a solid building there .

" to me , this says : ' we 're doing the exhibition hall to prevent the palace , " said wilhelm von boddien , who has spearheaded the campaign to raise the 80 million euros -lrb- $ 102 million -rrb- needed to pay for the historic facade . while critics say that boddien will never be able to come up with the necessary funds , the hamburg businessman said he 's certain the money will be pouring in once the government has actually given the green light for construction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of people visited the red info box to watch construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz during the 1990s he also said that an information center is badly needed on the sight to give people an idea of what is planned and get them excited about the project that 's been misunderstood in his opinion .

" it 's better to leave this area blank for people who have a better idea , as a slate for imagination . " since the current decision makers are still influenced by the east-west divide , it should be left for future generations " without tangible memories of what that space was . "

passersby can see pieces of sky through the waning skeleton , which will completely disappear by next year - if workers do n't find even more asbestos , that is . after an earlier decontamination operation that cost millions , the cancer-causing building material has again surfaced during the dismantling and could stretch the palace 's removal to 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1993 , supporters of the imperial palace set up a mock version to get people 's attention it 's yet another twist and delay in the saga surrounding the space 's future that began soon after germany 's reunification in 1990 .
on the one side of the debate stood those calling for the preservation of the proletarian palace ; on the other were proponents of reconstructing berlin 's imperial palace , which was severely damaged during world war ii and demolished by the east german regime in 1950 . the latter group won the backing of germany 's parliament , which supports building a cultural and scientific center .
situated vis-a-vis the city 's world-famous museum island and named after german researcher alexander von humboldt , the humboldt forum would house berlin 's non-european art collections , nearby humboldt university 's science collections as well as parts of berlin 's central library .
an entertainment and convention center would compliment the complex , which would be modern on the inside while coated with the imperial palace 's historic facade . gree n space vs. you n g art but according to government officials , the palace 's reconstruction - not least for financial reasons - wo n't begin before 2012 .
a green space is meant to fill the void in the interim .
before the best landscape proposals can be unveiled in september , the makers of berlin art magazine mo n opol recently presented an alternative idea : a temporary museum featuring the works of young artists . bildunterschrift : graft architects , known for redesigning us actor brad pitt 's home , propose housing the temporary museum in an organic " cloud " structure " we want to let contemporary art meet contemporary architecture , " ingolf kern , one of the magazine 's editors , said after architects from the firms of schneider + schumacher , graft , gmp , bottega + erhardt and sauerbruch hutton unveiled their sketches for a museum . supporters of the project , including former german culture minister christina weiss , say that the space is too prominent to let it sit vacant for several years .
but city officials give the temporary museum little chance of becoming reality . bildunterschrift : a proposal to build a temporary labyrinth in the square might already be taking things too far for berlin city officials " we want to use as little tax money as possible and still create a place that is accepted by the public , " said petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department .
" an art museum would contradict this ... there 's certainly no plan to put a solid building there . " a case of palace sabotage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wilhelm von boddien is the palace , " one commentator recently said while museum backers did emphasize that the structure was not meant to stay , those pushing for a reconstruction of the imperial palace said they were concerned that the project was an attempt to thwart the humboldt forum . " to me , this says : ' we 're doing the exhibition hall to prevent the palace , " said wilhelm von boddien , who has spearheaded the campaign to raise the 80 million euros -lrb- $ 102 million -rrb- needed to pay for the historic facade . while critics say that boddien will never be able to come up with the necessary funds , the hamburg businessman said he 's certain the money will be pouring in once the government has actually given the green light for construction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of people visited the red info box to watch construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz during the 1990s he also said that an information center is badly needed on the sight to give people an idea of what is planned and get them excited about the project that 's been misunderstood in his opinion .

" it 's better to leave this area blank for people who have a better idea , as a slate for imagination . " since the current decision makers are still influenced by the east-west divide , it should be left for future generations " without tangible memories of what that space was . "

" to open the german broadband markets to competition will lead to better services and lower internet prices for consumers , " said viviane reding , the eu telecommunications commissioner , in a statement . in a letter sent today to the german telecoms regulator , the bu n des n etzage n tur , the commission asked that the proposals be implemented " without further delay .

" at the moment there is too much talk about the military component and not enough about the long-term political process . " merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment . " germany is no longer the sick man of europe , " she said .
" i think we have turned the corner . " data released last week showed that the german economy grew by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , its fastest pace in more than five years . " i 'm thoroughly convinced that we will break out of the circle of spiraling debt in the next few months , " she said , adding that germany is on track to meet eu regulations of limiting new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . merkel said she plans to continue the reform process started by her predecessor , gerhard schröder - who she credited with taking steps to cut german unemployment - by alleviating the tax burden for small and medium-sized businesses and intensifying efforts to scrap bureaucracy . germa n y 's fight agai n st terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans may have to get used to seeing more cameras watching public spaces germany is also faced with a new task of fighting terrorism at home after two suitcase bombs were discovered on local trains at the end of july , merkel said . she called for additional video surveillance in train stations after recordings helped authorities find and arrest one of two men suspected of planting bombs on the trains headed to the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " we will of course have to draw the necessary consequences regarding the events in kiel and the planned attacks on the railway , " she said , mentioning the city where the first suspect was arrested .
" certainly no one will claim that the video surveillance is not an important thing . " in light of the failed german rail attacks , merkel also said germany needs to expedite the implementation of a database to help identify and track terror suspects in germany . back i n to the political fray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of foreign and domestic issues are waiting for politicians ' attention since going on vacation , merkel has had to watch germans ' approval of her slide downward to a record low of about 30 percent . what seems to rankle most with german voters , pollsters said , is her inability to come up with reforms that are convincing and to forge agreement with her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- junior partners without a major debate . merkel , however , had words of praise for spd head kurt beck , dismissed claims of too much bickering within the ruling grand coalition and vowed to press ahead with her political course . " i 'm not going to bother with opinion polls , " she said .
" the political course we 've adopted is right , and i 'm convinced it will make this government a success .
we have been and will remain truthful to the people about what we are going to do and this will pay off in the future . " gü n ter grass ' belated apology merkel even found time during the press conference to criticize nobel literature laureate günter grass for admitting to being a member of the nazi army 's waffen ss . " i wish we had been informed of his biography in entirety from the beginning , " she said .

steinmeier 's comments , therefore , were far from redundant . germany 's top diplomat began a three-day visit to the insurgency-wracked country late on sunday , his first to afghanistan , during which he will meet with president hamid karzai and other officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will get his first taste of afghanistan steinmeier will also visit germany 's military bases in the northern cities of mazar-i-sharif , kunduz and faizabad where some 2,850 german troops are based as part of the nato-led international stability and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany took over the command of the 21,000-strong isaf in june . the foreign minister will visit the new german headquarters at mazar-i-sharif and the german reconstruction team in kunduz . resilient in the face of increasing dangers while the german contingent is based in the more stable areas of the country , everything in afghanistan is relative .
considering that the country is going through its worst bout of violence since the ouster of the hard-line taliban regime in us-led invasion in late 2001 , german troops are hardly based in a peaceful idyll in the hindukush . but steinmeier insisted that germany 's resolve was strong .
" our engagement in afghanistan is long-lasting , " he told reporters on his arrival in the afghan capital , and pledged germany 's continued support and involvement in the reconstruction of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is one of the army 's biggest missions jens plötner , a foreign ministry spokesman , echoed steinmeier 's pledge .
" afghanistan remains one of the main focuses of german foreign affairs .
we have one of our biggest reconstruction projects worldwide based there , as well as one of our biggest military presences . " however , before leaving for kabul , steinmeier told the bild am sonntag newspaper that germany was concerned about the worsening security situation in afghanistan .
" the security situation in afghanistan has deteriorated , " he said . most violent phase since 2001 that was highlighted over the weekend when british ground troops and attack helicopters had to come to the aid of afghan forces which were engaged in a bloody battle with insurgents in the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung in kabul while the german troops in the relatively peaceful north have a reconstruction mandate , the dangers for the bundeswehr in afghanistan have increased of late .
in july , during a visit by defense minister franz-josef jung , german bases came under attack and jung was told by senior officers that the threat to german forces from " improvised explosive devices " -lrb- ied -rrb- and taliban missiles was increasing . " the increase of attacks with ied , and also the increase in attacks on our soldiers with rocket launchers and also suicide bombings , have given our mission a serious and dangerous new quality , " jung said at the time . reconstruction efforts under threat the considerable efforts of the taliban to disrupt the reconstruction of afghanistan means that there are few successes of note but some progress has been made in the past four years of international assistance , with a number of new schools and irrigation programs testament to the perseverance of all those involved in getting the country back on its feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban fight back however , that progress is now more in danger than at any other time since the hard line islamist regime was ousted .
the return of the taliban , the exploding drug trade and increasing corruption provide afghanistan , the fifth-poorest country in the world , with gigantic problems . but for germany there is no alternative to remaining committed to the reconstruction program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 21.08.2006 opinion : critical period in the democratic republic of congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the first free elections in dr congo in 40 years , no one received an absolute majority and a run-off will take place .
now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .
one hopes that for the congolese , because right now , there is no other choice . alexa n der göbel is a n africa expert with deutsche welle radio .

but it is desperate to avoid a situation in which its troops would have to fire on israeli soldiers . the prospect of germany 's first military foray in the middle east since world war ii is viewed with trepidation by political leaders and is deeply unpopular among the german public which fears a bloody quagmire . but chancellor angela merkel said germany had no choice but to participate in the mission to secure a shaky un-brokered ceasefire between hezbollah and israel after a month of fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says germany has no choice but to participate in the mission if germany bowed out , " the government would see its influence wane dramatically in terms of shaping its foreign policy , " she said . no ground troops or police but merkel has firmly ruled out the deployment of combat troops in an effort to contain the risk of a direct confrontation with israel , where memories of german aggression are still fresh among holocaust survivors . on sunday , merkel also ruled out sending german police to the region . there has been speculation that german police would help to secure lebanon 's borders with syria and israel but merkel said germany 's role would be to advise lebanese security forces on how to carry out the job . " as far as securing the airports and the borders is concerned , germany 's interest is to advise and to train the lebanese security forces .
the borders will be protected by lebanese soldiers or police . " she reiterated that germany planned to send a small navy unit to help secure lebanon 's coastal waters . " we are prepared to send a compact marine unit to secure the seaways off the lebanese coast , " she said .
" of course the conditions for the engagement still need to be clarified , " she added .
merkel underlined that germany 's involvement hinged on getting parliamentary approval for the deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is prepared to send medical mobile units to southern lebanon berlin however has already said it is prepared to send mobile medical units and transport planes to southern lebanon .
this falls under humanitarian aid and does not require parliamentary approval . tricky foreign policy challenge the top-selling newspaper bild recently called the issue of whether to deploy german troops in the middle east " the trickiest question german foreign policy has ever faced . " although jewish leaders had recently expressed serious reservations about a german mission in the middle east , the leader of germany 's main jewish group said she saw german participation as a defense of israel 's sovereignty . " germany and israel are allied countries , " charlotte knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " germany already has about 7,700 soldiers overseas serving in international peacekeeping forces , mainly in the balkans , afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo . but a poll released friday found that a solid majority - 58 percent - opposed any german participation in the un force in lebanon . about one in four - 26 percent - said they would support a german role if there were a firm guarantee that german soldiers would not confront israeli troops in battle , according to the poll for zdf public television conducted last week . the end of an " artificial taboo ? " " the risks are so incalculable that i do not think that the time is ripe for any peacekeeping force , with german involvement or not , " the director of the german-orient institute in hamburg , udo steinbach , told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldiers return to israel after a ceasefire was called last week steinbach said diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting truce between israel and hezbollah had a long way to go before a un force would have a peace to keep , saying the situation in the border region was still " highly explosive . " however , if the force 's mandate were revised and its chances of success boosted by bringing nations such as syria on board , he said it would be only natural for germany to play a role . " participation in this force would mean -lrb- germany -rrb- acting like a normal country in the middle east , with all the risks that entails , " he said . henning riecke , an analyst at the german council on foreign relations , said involvement in a un force would mark the end of an " artificial taboo " because the postwar german army had already embarked on deployments abroad in the 1990s . " the bundeswehr is already present around the world and that is largely accepted by the german people , " he told afp . " in two or three years we will have forgotten the debate about german participation and will be talking about the difficulty the force is having in accomplishing its goals .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german palace of the republic is slowly disappearing the so-called palast der republik , or palace of the republic , which housed the former communist parliament and served as an entertainment venue for the select masses , already stands stripped to the girder .
passersby can see pieces of sky through the waning skeleton , which will completely disappear by next year - if workers do n't find even more asbestos , that is . after an earlier decontamination operation that cost millions , the cancer-causing building material has again surfaced during the dismantling and could stretch the palace 's removal to 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1993 , supporters of the imperial palace set up a mock version to get people 's attention it 's yet another twist and delay in the saga surrounding the space 's future that began soon after germany 's reunification in 1990 .
on the one side of the debate stood those calling for the preservation of the proletarian palace ; on the other were proponents of reconstructing berlin 's imperial palace , which was severely damaged during world war ii and demolished by the east german regime in 1950 . the latter group won the backing of germany 's parliament , which supports building a cultural and scientific center .
situated vis-a-vis the city 's world-famous museum island and named after german researcher alexander von humboldt , the humboldt forum would house berlin 's non-european art collections , nearby humboldt university 's science collections as well as parts of berlin 's central library .
an entertainment and convention center would compliment the complex , which would be modern on the inside while coated with the imperial palace 's historic facade . gree n space vs. you n g art but according to government officials , the palace 's reconstruction - not least for financial reasons - wo n't begin before 2012 .
a green space is meant to fill the void in the interim .
before the best landscape proposals can be unveiled in september , the makers of berlin art magazine mo n opol recently presented an alternative idea : a temporary museum featuring the works of young artists . bildunterschrift : graft architects , known for redesigning us actor brad pitt 's home , propose housing the temporary museum in an organic " cloud " structure " we want to let contemporary art meet contemporary architecture , " ingolf kern , one of the magazine 's editors , said after architects from the firms of schneider + schumacher , graft , gmp , bottega + erhardt and sauerbruch hutton unveiled their sketches for a museum . supporters of the project , including former german culture minister christina weiss , say that the space is too prominent to let it sit vacant for several years .
but city officials give the temporary museum little chance of becoming reality . bildunterschrift : a proposal to build a temporary labyrinth in the square might already be taking things too far for berlin city officials " we want to use as little tax money as possible and still create a place that is accepted by the public , " said petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department .
" an art museum would contradict this ... there 's certainly no plan to put a solid building there . " a case of palace sabotage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wilhelm von boddien is the palace , " one commentator recently said while museum backers did emphasize that the structure was not meant to stay , those pushing for a reconstruction of the imperial palace said they were concerned that the project was an attempt to thwart the humboldt forum . " to me , this says : ' we 're doing the exhibition hall to prevent the palace , " said wilhelm von boddien , who has spearheaded the campaign to raise the 80 million euros -lrb- $ 102 million -rrb- needed to pay for the historic facade . while critics say that boddien will never be able to come up with the necessary funds , the hamburg businessman said he 's certain the money will be pouring in once the government has actually given the green light for construction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of people visited the red info box to watch construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz during the 1990s he also said that an information center is badly needed on the sight to give people an idea of what is planned and get them excited about the project that 's been misunderstood in his opinion . " people associate the palace with monarchy , with absolutism , " he said .
" they fail to see that people have a yearning for beauty , for identity .
we 're returning berlin 's identity ... it 's the cure for an -lrb- architectural -rrb- ensemble , which had its core ripped out . " a slate for imagi n atio n architectural theorist wilfried wang begged to differ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will future generations come up with better ideas for the schlossplatz , or palace square ?
" the palace is an expression of a lack of imagination of the political class , " said the berlin-based architect , who is a former director of the german architecture museum and teaches at the university of texas at austin . " if you do n't have any ideas , do n't build any mistakes , " he added .
" it 's better to leave this area blank for people who have a better idea , as a slate for imagination . " since the current decision makers are still influenced by the east-west divide , it should be left for future generations " without tangible memories of what that space was . "
wang added that he favored using the ground level of any future building as a covered fresh produce market with restaurants and bars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2006 italy asked by israel to lead peacekeeping force in lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un peacekeeping mission will be stepped up to some 15,000 troops israeli prime minister ehud olmert has asked italy to lead the united nations peacekeeping force in lebanon to enforce a fragile ceasefire , which is entering its second week . olmert made the request in a telephone conversation sunday with italian prime minister romano prodi , according to a statement released by the israeli prime minister 's office . " it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

steinmeier 's comments , therefore , were far from redundant . germany 's top diplomat began a three-day visit to the insurgency-wracked country late on sunday , his first to afghanistan , during which he will meet with president hamid karzai and other officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will get his first taste of afghanistan steinmeier will also visit germany 's military bases in the northern cities of mazar-i-sharif , kunduz and faizabad where some 2,850 german troops are based as part of the nato-led international stability and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany took over the command of the 21,000-strong isaf in june . the foreign minister will visit the new german headquarters at mazar-i-sharif and the german reconstruction team in kunduz . resilient in the face of increasing dangers while the german contingent is based in the more stable areas of the country , everything in afghanistan is relative .
considering that the country is going through its worst bout of violence since the ouster of the hard-line taliban regime in us-led invasion in late 2001 , german troops are hardly based in a peaceful idyll in the hindukush . but steinmeier insisted that germany 's resolve was strong .
" our engagement in afghanistan is long-lasting , " he told reporters on his arrival in the afghan capital , and pledged germany 's continued support and involvement in the reconstruction of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is one of the army 's biggest missions jens plötner , a foreign ministry spokesman , echoed steinmeier 's pledge .
" afghanistan remains one of the main focuses of german foreign affairs .
we have one of our biggest reconstruction projects worldwide based there , as well as one of our biggest military presences . " however , before leaving for kabul , steinmeier told the bild am sonntag newspaper that germany was concerned about the worsening security situation in afghanistan .
" the security situation in afghanistan has deteriorated , " he said . most violent phase since 2001 that was highlighted over the weekend when british ground troops and attack helicopters had to come to the aid of afghan forces which were engaged in a bloody battle with insurgents in the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung in kabul while the german troops in the relatively peaceful north have a reconstruction mandate , the dangers for the bundeswehr in afghanistan have increased of late .
in july , during a visit by defense minister franz-josef jung , german bases came under attack and jung was told by senior officers that the threat to german forces from " improvised explosive devices " -lrb- ied -rrb- and taliban missiles was increasing . " the increase of attacks with ied , and also the increase in attacks on our soldiers with rocket launchers and also suicide bombings , have given our mission a serious and dangerous new quality , " jung said at the time . reconstruction efforts under threat the considerable efforts of the taliban to disrupt the reconstruction of afghanistan means that there are few successes of note but some progress has been made in the past four years of international assistance , with a number of new schools and irrigation programs testament to the perseverance of all those involved in getting the country back on its feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban fight back however , that progress is now more in danger than at any other time since the hard line islamist regime was ousted .
the return of the taliban , the exploding drug trade and increasing corruption provide afghanistan , the fifth-poorest country in the world , with gigantic problems . but for germany there is no alternative to remaining committed to the reconstruction program .
for the government to pull its troops out would be a disastrous signal for a country fighting to survival . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first suicide attack on german forces in afghanistan for the first time , a suicide bomber has targeted german bundeswehr troops in northern afghanistan .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .

" at the moment there is too much talk about the military component and not enough about the long-term political process . " merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment . " germany is no longer the sick man of europe , " she said .
" i think we have turned the corner . " data released last week showed that the german economy grew by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , its fastest pace in more than five years . " i 'm thoroughly convinced that we will break out of the circle of spiraling debt in the next few months , " she said , adding that germany is on track to meet eu regulations of limiting new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . merkel said she plans to continue the reform process started by her predecessor , gerhard schröder - who she credited with taking steps to cut german unemployment - by alleviating the tax burden for small and medium-sized businesses and intensifying efforts to scrap bureaucracy . germa n y 's fight agai n st terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans may have to get used to seeing more cameras watching public spaces germany is also faced with a new task of fighting terrorism at home after two suitcase bombs were discovered on local trains at the end of july , merkel said . she called for additional video surveillance in train stations after recordings helped authorities find and arrest one of two men suspected of planting bombs on the trains headed to the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " we will of course have to draw the necessary consequences regarding the events in kiel and the planned attacks on the railway , " she said , mentioning the city where the first suspect was arrested .
" certainly no one will claim that the video surveillance is not an important thing . " in light of the failed german rail attacks , merkel also said germany needs to expedite the implementation of a database to help identify and track terror suspects in germany . back i n to the political fray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of foreign and domestic issues are waiting for politicians ' attention since going on vacation , merkel has had to watch germans ' approval of her slide downward to a record low of about 30 percent . what seems to rankle most with german voters , pollsters said , is her inability to come up with reforms that are convincing and to forge agreement with her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- junior partners without a major debate . merkel , however , had words of praise for spd head kurt beck , dismissed claims of too much bickering within the ruling grand coalition and vowed to press ahead with her political course . " i 'm not going to bother with opinion polls , " she said .
" the political course we 've adopted is right , and i 'm convinced it will make this government a success .
we have been and will remain truthful to the people about what we are going to do and this will pay off in the future . " gü n ter grass ' belated apology merkel even found time during the press conference to criticize nobel literature laureate günter grass for admitting to being a member of the nazi army 's waffen ss . " i wish we had been informed of his biography in entirety from the beginning , " she said .
" i am not surprised at the widespread criticism over the late revelation of this biographical fact because grass never held back in speaking his mind on other issues .

" to open the german broadband markets to competition will lead to better services and lower internet prices for consumers , " said viviane reding , the eu telecommunications commissioner , in a statement . in a letter sent today to the german telecoms regulator , the bu n des n etzage n tur , the commission asked that the proposals be implemented " without further delay .

all 25 member states have complied except germany . the prices new entrants to the market would pay for this access would be set by the german regulator . " overregulatio n " a spokesman for deutsche telekom , mark nierwetberg , told bloomberg that the ruling is " a classic example of overregulation . "
he said that the company 's rivals have a bigger share of the broadband market in germany than other former monopolies in other countries and their rivals . the telecoms giant has argued that it needs exclusive use of the network in order to recoup its investment . deutsche telekom controls a large majority of broadband connections in germany . eu commission reding criticized the time it has taken for germany to act on this issue , saying it has been three years since the eu telecoms directive came into force but the german network regulator is only now beginning to take action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

now it looks like murat kurnaz from bremen will return home by the end of the month , after more than four years at guantanamo . " it 's clear that mr. kurnaz will be flown to germany ; only the exact day is not yet clear , " kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke told german news agency dpa on sunday .
the financial times deutschland daily and der spiegel newsmagazine had previously reported he would be transferred to germany in august . berlin had refused american demands that kurnaz be put under round-the-clock surveillance and his passport confiscated , according to der spiegel .
the magazine also reported that berlin had rejected a us request to take in additional guantanamo bay prisoners . the german government neither confirmed nor denied reports of kurnaz ' impending release from the us prison for terror suspects .
berlin and washington " will continue to work on resolving the case , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel discussed kurnaz ' case at their july meeting in stralsund berlin has advocated kurnaz ' release for some time and chancellor angela merkel even brought up the matter during president george bush 's visit to stralsund in july . murat kurnaz was born in bremen of turkish parents in 1982 and lived in germany with a permanent residence permit until his arrest .
he does not have german citizenship . four years in guantanamo in 2001 , he traveled to pakistan , where he visited several islamic schools and was arrested by pakistani police during routine checks , reported die welt newspaper .
he was then handed over to us authorities in afghanistan and taken to the prison on guantanamo bay in cuba in early 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us asked germany to take in other guantanamo prisoners too american officials suspected kurnaz of being a dangerous extremist , though a us court found these allegations to be untrue in january 2005 . both amnesty international and docke claim kurnaz was held under inhumane conditions in guantanamo , beaten and chained to his bed for days on end , reported die welt . " i would be really happy for kurnaz " -lrb- if he were released -rrb- , said docke in an interview with ap .

steinmeier 's comments , therefore , were far from redundant . germany 's top diplomat began a three-day visit to the insurgency-wracked country late on sunday , his first to afghanistan , during which he will meet with president hamid karzai and other officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will get his first taste of afghanistan steinmeier will also visit germany 's military bases in the northern cities of mazar-i-sharif , kunduz and faizabad where some 2,850 german troops are based as part of the nato-led international stability and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .

considering that the country is going through its worst bout of violence since the ouster of the hard-line taliban regime in us-led invasion in late 2001 , german troops are hardly based in a peaceful idyll in the hindukush . but steinmeier insisted that germany 's resolve was strong .
" our engagement in afghanistan is long-lasting , " he told reporters on his arrival in the afghan capital , and pledged germany 's continued support and involvement in the reconstruction of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is one of the army 's biggest missions jens plötner , a foreign ministry spokesman , echoed steinmeier 's pledge .
" afghanistan remains one of the main focuses of german foreign affairs .

" the increase of attacks with ied , and also the increase in attacks on our soldiers with rocket launchers and also suicide bombings , have given our mission a serious and dangerous new quality , " jung said at the time . reconstruction efforts under threat the considerable efforts of the taliban to disrupt the reconstruction of afghanistan means that there are few successes of note but some progress has been made in the past four years of international assistance , with a number of new schools and irrigation programs testament to the perseverance of all those involved in getting the country back on its feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban fight back however , that progress is now more in danger than at any other time since the hard line islamist regime was ousted .

steinmeier 's comments , therefore , were far from redundant . germany 's top diplomat began a three-day visit to the insurgency-wracked country late on sunday , his first to afghanistan , during which he will meet with president hamid karzai and other officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will get his first taste of afghanistan steinmeier will also visit germany 's military bases in the northern cities of mazar-i-sharif , kunduz and faizabad where some 2,850 german troops are based as part of the nato-led international stability and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany took over the command of the 21,000-strong isaf in june . the foreign minister will visit the new german headquarters at mazar-i-sharif and the german reconstruction team in kunduz . resilient in the face of increasing dangers while the german contingent is based in the more stable areas of the country , everything in afghanistan is relative .
considering that the country is going through its worst bout of violence since the ouster of the hard-line taliban regime in us-led invasion in late 2001 , german troops are hardly based in a peaceful idyll in the hindukush . but steinmeier insisted that germany 's resolve was strong .
" our engagement in afghanistan is long-lasting , " he told reporters on his arrival in the afghan capital , and pledged germany 's continued support and involvement in the reconstruction of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is one of the army 's biggest missions jens plötner , a foreign ministry spokesman , echoed steinmeier 's pledge .
" afghanistan remains one of the main focuses of german foreign affairs .
we have one of our biggest reconstruction projects worldwide based there , as well as one of our biggest military presences . " however , before leaving for kabul , steinmeier told the bild am sonntag newspaper that germany was concerned about the worsening security situation in afghanistan .
" the security situation in afghanistan has deteriorated , " he said . most violent phase since 2001 that was highlighted over the weekend when british ground troops and attack helicopters had to come to the aid of afghan forces which were engaged in a bloody battle with insurgents in the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung in kabul while the german troops in the relatively peaceful north have a reconstruction mandate , the dangers for the bundeswehr in afghanistan have increased of late .
in july , during a visit by defense minister franz-josef jung , german bases came under attack and jung was told by senior officers that the threat to german forces from " improvised explosive devices " -lrb- ied -rrb- and taliban missiles was increasing . " the increase of attacks with ied , and also the increase in attacks on our soldiers with rocket launchers and also suicide bombings , have given our mission a serious and dangerous new quality , " jung said at the time . reconstruction efforts under threat the considerable efforts of the taliban to disrupt the reconstruction of afghanistan means that there are few successes of note but some progress has been made in the past four years of international assistance , with a number of new schools and irrigation programs testament to the perseverance of all those involved in getting the country back on its feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban fight back however , that progress is now more in danger than at any other time since the hard line islamist regime was ousted .
the return of the taliban , the exploding drug trade and increasing corruption provide afghanistan , the fifth-poorest country in the world , with gigantic problems . but for germany there is no alternative to remaining committed to the reconstruction program .
for the government to pull its troops out would be a disastrous signal for a country fighting to survival . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first suicide attack on german forces in afghanistan for the first time , a suicide bomber has targeted german bundeswehr troops in northern afghanistan .

now it looks like murat kurnaz from bremen will return home by the end of the month , after more than four years at guantanamo . " it 's clear that mr. kurnaz will be flown to germany ; only the exact day is not yet clear , " kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke told german news agency dpa on sunday .
the financial times deutschland daily and der spiegel newsmagazine had previously reported he would be transferred to germany in august . berlin had refused american demands that kurnaz be put under round-the-clock surveillance and his passport confiscated , according to der spiegel .
the magazine also reported that berlin had rejected a us request to take in additional guantanamo bay prisoners . the german government neither confirmed nor denied reports of kurnaz ' impending release from the us prison for terror suspects .
berlin and washington " will continue to work on resolving the case , " a foreign ministry spokeswoman told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel discussed kurnaz ' case at their july meeting in stralsund berlin has advocated kurnaz ' release for some time and chancellor angela merkel even brought up the matter during president george bush 's visit to stralsund in july . murat kurnaz was born in bremen of turkish parents in 1982 and lived in germany with a permanent residence permit until his arrest .
he does not have german citizenship . four years in guantanamo in 2001 , he traveled to pakistan , where he visited several islamic schools and was arrested by pakistani police during routine checks , reported die welt newspaper .
he was then handed over to us authorities in afghanistan and taken to the prison on guantanamo bay in cuba in early 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us asked germany to take in other guantanamo prisoners too american officials suspected kurnaz of being a dangerous extremist , though a us court found these allegations to be untrue in january 2005 . both amnesty international and docke claim kurnaz was held under inhumane conditions in guantanamo , beaten and chained to his bed for days on end , reported die welt . " i would be really happy for kurnaz " -lrb- if he were released -rrb- , said docke in an interview with ap .
" everyday that he sits there is terrible . " some 450 terror suspects are being held at the us prison on guantanamo bay .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .
one hopes that for the congolese , because right now , there is no other choice . alexa n der göbel is a n africa expert with deutsche welle radio .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .

" to open the german broadband markets to competition will lead to better services and lower internet prices for consumers , " said viviane reding , the eu telecommunications commissioner , in a statement . in a letter sent today to the german telecoms regulator , the bu n des n etzage n tur , the commission asked that the proposals be implemented " without further delay . "
it could force deutsche telekom , which is 31.3-percent owned by the germany government , to make broadband internet access available to competitors by the end of the year . broadband internet connections make possible data-heavy computer applications such as music , video and phone calls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is not anxious to open up its network if rivals do take up the offer , it would almost certainly result in lower prices for consumers .
deutsche telekom customers pay around 40 euros -lrb- $ 51.24 -rrb- per month for unlimited broadband service while customers of the british telecoms operator bt pay as little as $ 18.72 per month for similar service . in july 2003 , the commission passed a directive requiring member states to compel dominant former telecoms monopolies to sell wholesale access to competitors at the bitstream level , which would give them the ability to offer the same phone and data services at the network owners at competitive prices .
all 25 member states have complied except germany . the prices new entrants to the market would pay for this access would be set by the german regulator . " overregulatio n " a spokesman for deutsche telekom , mark nierwetberg , told bloomberg that the ruling is " a classic example of overregulation . "
he said that the company 's rivals have a bigger share of the broadband market in germany than other former monopolies in other countries and their rivals . the telecoms giant has argued that it needs exclusive use of the network in order to recoup its investment . deutsche telekom controls a large majority of broadband connections in germany . eu commission reding criticized the time it has taken for germany to act on this issue , saying it has been three years since the eu telecoms directive came into force but the german network regulator is only now beginning to take action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .

" at the moment there is too much talk about the military component and not enough about the long-term political process . " merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .

the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?

" to open the german broadband markets to competition will lead to better services and lower internet prices for consumers , " said viviane reding , the eu telecommunications commissioner , in a statement . in a letter sent today to the german telecoms regulator , the bu n des n etzage n tur , the commission asked that the proposals be implemented " without further delay . "
it could force deutsche telekom , which is 31.3-percent owned by the germany government , to make broadband internet access available to competitors by the end of the year . broadband internet connections make possible data-heavy computer applications such as music , video and phone calls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is not anxious to open up its network if rivals do take up the offer , it would almost certainly result in lower prices for consumers .
deutsche telekom customers pay around 40 euros -lrb- $ 51.24 -rrb- per month for unlimited broadband service while customers of the british telecoms operator bt pay as little as $ 18.72 per month for similar service . in july 2003 , the commission passed a directive requiring member states to compel dominant former telecoms monopolies to sell wholesale access to competitors at the bitstream level , which would give them the ability to offer the same phone and data services at the network owners at competitive prices .
all 25 member states have complied except germany . the prices new entrants to the market would pay for this access would be set by the german regulator . " overregulatio n " a spokesman for deutsche telekom , mark nierwetberg , told bloomberg that the ruling is " a classic example of overregulation . "
he said that the company 's rivals have a bigger share of the broadband market in germany than other former monopolies in other countries and their rivals . the telecoms giant has argued that it needs exclusive use of the network in order to recoup its investment . deutsche telekom controls a large majority of broadband connections in germany . eu commission reding criticized the time it has taken for germany to act on this issue , saying it has been three years since the eu telecoms directive came into force but the german network regulator is only now beginning to take action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" at the moment there is too much talk about the military component and not enough about the long-term political process . " merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment . " germany is no longer the sick man of europe , " she said .
" i think we have turned the corner . " data released last week showed that the german economy grew by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , its fastest pace in more than five years . " i 'm thoroughly convinced that we will break out of the circle of spiraling debt in the next few months , " she said , adding that germany is on track to meet eu regulations of limiting new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . merkel said she plans to continue the reform process started by her predecessor , gerhard schröder - who she credited with taking steps to cut german unemployment - by alleviating the tax burden for small and medium-sized businesses and intensifying efforts to scrap bureaucracy . germa n y 's fight agai n st terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans may have to get used to seeing more cameras watching public spaces germany is also faced with a new task of fighting terrorism at home after two suitcase bombs were discovered on local trains at the end of july , merkel said . she called for additional video surveillance in train stations after recordings helped authorities find and arrest one of two men suspected of planting bombs on the trains headed to the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " we will of course have to draw the necessary consequences regarding the events in kiel and the planned attacks on the railway , " she said , mentioning the city where the first suspect was arrested .
" certainly no one will claim that the video surveillance is not an important thing . " in light of the failed german rail attacks , merkel also said germany needs to expedite the implementation of a database to help identify and track terror suspects in germany . back i n to the political fray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of foreign and domestic issues are waiting for politicians ' attention since going on vacation , merkel has had to watch germans ' approval of her slide downward to a record low of about 30 percent . what seems to rankle most with german voters , pollsters said , is her inability to come up with reforms that are convincing and to forge agreement with her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- junior partners without a major debate . merkel , however , had words of praise for spd head kurt beck , dismissed claims of too much bickering within the ruling grand coalition and vowed to press ahead with her political course . " i 'm not going to bother with opinion polls , " she said .
" the political course we 've adopted is right , and i 'm convinced it will make this government a success .
we have been and will remain truthful to the people about what we are going to do and this will pay off in the future . " gü n ter grass ' belated apology merkel even found time during the press conference to criticize nobel literature laureate günter grass for admitting to being a member of the nazi army 's waffen ss .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 21.08.2006 opinion : critical period in the democratic republic of congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the first free elections in dr congo in 40 years , no one received an absolute majority and a run-off will take place .
now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .
one hopes that for the congolese , because right now , there is no other choice . alexa n der göbel is a n africa expert with deutsche welle radio .

" i would be really happy for kurnaz " -lrb- if he were released -rrb- , said docke in an interview with ap .

" at the moment there is too much talk about the military component and not enough about the long-term political process . " merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment .

" merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment . " germany is no longer the sick man of europe , " she said .
" i think we have turned the corner . " data released last week showed that the german economy grew by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , its fastest pace in more than five years . " i 'm thoroughly convinced that we will break out of the circle of spiraling debt in the next few months , " she said , adding that germany is on track to meet eu regulations of limiting new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . merkel said she plans to continue the reform process started by her predecessor , gerhard schröder - who she credited with taking steps to cut german unemployment - by alleviating the tax burden for small and medium-sized businesses and intensifying efforts to scrap bureaucracy . germa n y 's fight agai n st terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans may have to get used to seeing more cameras watching public spaces germany is also faced with a new task of fighting terrorism at home after two suitcase bombs were discovered on local trains at the end of july , merkel said . she called for additional video surveillance in train stations after recordings helped authorities find and arrest one of two men suspected of planting bombs on the trains headed to the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " we will of course have to draw the necessary consequences regarding the events in kiel and the planned attacks on the railway , " she said , mentioning the city where the first suspect was arrested .
" certainly no one will claim that the video surveillance is not an important thing . " in light of the failed german rail attacks , merkel also said germany needs to expedite the implementation of a database to help identify and track terror suspects in germany . back i n to the political fray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of foreign and domestic issues are waiting for politicians ' attention since going on vacation , merkel has had to watch germans ' approval of her slide downward to a record low of about 30 percent . what seems to rankle most with german voters , pollsters said , is her inability to come up with reforms that are convincing and to forge agreement with her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- junior partners without a major debate . merkel , however , had words of praise for spd head kurt beck , dismissed claims of too much bickering within the ruling grand coalition and vowed to press ahead with her political course . " i 'm not going to bother with opinion polls , " she said .
" the political course we 've adopted is right , and i 'm convinced it will make this government a success .
we have been and will remain truthful to the people about what we are going to do and this will pay off in the future . " gü n ter grass ' belated apology merkel even found time during the press conference to criticize nobel literature laureate günter grass for admitting to being a member of the nazi army 's waffen ss . " i wish we had been informed of his biography in entirety from the beginning , " she said .
" i am not surprised at the widespread criticism over the late revelation of this biographical fact because grass never held back in speaking his mind on other issues .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" it is important that italy should lead the international force and send troops to also oversee the lebanon-syria border crossings , " the statement said , adding that italy 's contribution is " vital to the implementation of -lrb- un -rrb- security council resolution 1701 and it will be an important contribution to peace and stability in the middle east . " italy is expected to send between 2,500 and 3,000 troops , the italian daily la repubblica reported on monday . un resolution 1701 has expanded the mandate of the force , demanding an end to hostilities between israel and the hezbollah militia and calls for hezbollah to disarm and stop its weapon imports .
it calls for israeli troops to withdraw from southern lebanon in tandem with the deployment of the lebanese army and a strengthened un force of 15,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french peacekeepers are arriving in lebanon , just not as many as hoped it had been thought that france would lead an international contingent given its historical ties to the region , but paris last week backed off from taking on a leadership role , saying it would only commit 400 soldiers to the un force , known as unifil .
the 15,000 un soldiers would be deployed alongside a lebanese contingent of similar size . prodi 's office on sunday told reuters that the italian prime minister had discussed the force in separate telephone conversations with olmert and lebanese prime minister fouad siniora . on friday , italian defense minister arturo parisi said in a written statement that " eventually our country could assume the responsibility of leading the operation . " last week , bangladesh , indonesia , malaysia and nepal offered to contribute thousands of soldiers to the peacekeeping force .
the un said late last week that it wants to deploy about 3,500 soldiers within two weeks and step that up until the goal of 15,000 is reached . german contribution on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier reiterated that berlin will send no combat troops to lebanon but added that he was hopeful of a " robust " mandate for its proposed naval contingent . german defense minister franz-josef jung has been vague about details of a proposed naval deployment , but has said that sailors should be able to defend themselves . " it is not enough for them to have a pure observer status , " he said in an interview on german public television . german chancellor angela merkel called on the international community to increase its diplomatic efforts to reach a solution to the middle east conflict . " at the moment , there is too much discussion about the military component and too little talk about the long-term political process , " she said at a press conference in berlin on monday , saying it was necessary to " get at the root " of the problem . she said germany 's role , besides its participation in a peacekeeping force , would be " above all to advance the political process along with our european partners . " second week of truce the fragile truce ending 34 days of war in lebanon entered its second week on monday with both sides accusing the other of violating the ceasefire accord .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli armored vehicles as they returned from southern lebanon in northern israel sunday lebanon warned on sunday it would punish any group which violated the truce , in an implicit warning to hezbollah , as israel vowed it was preparing for the " next round " against the shiite guerrillas .
in an apparent bid to assure the international community of beirut 's commitment to the ceasefire , defense minister elias murr warned that anyone who breached the deal would face trial for treason .
" any violation ... any rocket that would give israel a justification -lrb- to hit lebanon -rrb- will be treated harshly , " murr said .
" it will be considered as direct collaboration with the israeli enemy . "
despite sharp criticism over a commando raid in lebanon which un chief kofi annan said was a violation of the truce , israel insisted it would not hesitate to act to prevent alleged cross-border arms smuggling to hezbollah from syria .
the raid against hezbollah in eastern lebanon , which saw one israeli soldier killed in subsequent clashes , drew an angry response from lebanon and a warning it could stop its troop deployment in the south .
annan said he was " deeply concerned about a violation by the israeli side " of the ceasefire deal outlined in security council resolution 1701 and called on all sides to respect an arms embargo , exercise maximum restraint and avoid " provocative actions . "
the truce took effect last monday to end the deadliest cross-border fighting in a quarter century that claimed close to 1,300 lives in lebanon and killed 161 israelis .
the government of beirut has said that conflict has cost lebanon 's economy $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion -lrb- 4.7 billion to 5.5 billion euros -rrb- , while the israeli government has estimated the fighting has cost its economy $ 1.6 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ready for mideast mission despite historical burden after weeks of debate , germany seems ready to take part in a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon .

" at the moment there is too much talk about the military component and not enough about the long-term political process . " merkel said it was crucial for united nations peacekeeping troops to enter the region soon to prevent a rekindling of the conflict that has cost some 1,200 people in lebanon and 157 israelis their lives . while merkel said she could not imagine peacekeeping scenario " in which europe is not engaged at all on the ground , " germany 's decision to limit its commitment to a small naval unit had been met with " strong approval " in the international community out of sensitivity for israel , where memories of the holocaust are still raw . merkel also called for the middle east quartet of the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations to take up its work in trying to find a solution to the conflict between israel and its neighbors . the recoveri n g germa n eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plagued with sluggish growth , merkel said germany has turned an economic corner domestically , merkel conceded that plans to raise the value-added tax from 16 percent to 19 percent in 2007 were unpopular , but pointed to signs of economic recovery , including accelerating growth and falling unemployment . " germany is no longer the sick man of europe , " she said .
" i think we have turned the corner . " data released last week showed that the german economy grew by 0.9 percent in the second quarter , its fastest pace in more than five years . " i 'm thoroughly convinced that we will break out of the circle of spiraling debt in the next few months , " she said , adding that germany is on track to meet eu regulations of limiting new debt to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . merkel said she plans to continue the reform process started by her predecessor , gerhard schröder - who she credited with taking steps to cut german unemployment - by alleviating the tax burden for small and medium-sized businesses and intensifying efforts to scrap bureaucracy . germa n y 's fight agai n st terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans may have to get used to seeing more cameras watching public spaces germany is also faced with a new task of fighting terrorism at home after two suitcase bombs were discovered on local trains at the end of july , merkel said . she called for additional video surveillance in train stations after recordings helped authorities find and arrest one of two men suspected of planting bombs on the trains headed to the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " we will of course have to draw the necessary consequences regarding the events in kiel and the planned attacks on the railway , " she said , mentioning the city where the first suspect was arrested .
" certainly no one will claim that the video surveillance is not an important thing . " in light of the failed german rail attacks , merkel also said germany needs to expedite the implementation of a database to help identify and track terror suspects in germany . back i n to the political fray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of foreign and domestic issues are waiting for politicians ' attention since going on vacation , merkel has had to watch germans ' approval of her slide downward to a record low of about 30 percent . what seems to rankle most with german voters , pollsters said , is her inability to come up with reforms that are convincing and to forge agreement with her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- junior partners without a major debate . merkel , however , had words of praise for spd head kurt beck , dismissed claims of too much bickering within the ruling grand coalition and vowed to press ahead with her political course . " i 'm not going to bother with opinion polls , " she said .
" the political course we 've adopted is right , and i 'm convinced it will make this government a success .
we have been and will remain truthful to the people about what we are going to do and this will pay off in the future . " gü n ter grass ' belated apology merkel even found time during the press conference to criticize nobel literature laureate günter grass for admitting to being a member of the nazi army 's waffen ss . " i wish we had been informed of his biography in entirety from the beginning , " she said .

the borders will be protected by lebanese soldiers or police . " she reiterated that germany planned to send a small navy unit to help secure lebanon 's coastal waters . " we are prepared to send a compact marine unit to secure the seaways off the lebanese coast , " she said .
" of course the conditions for the engagement still need to be clarified , " she added .
merkel underlined that germany 's involvement hinged on getting parliamentary approval for the deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is prepared to send medical mobile units to southern lebanon berlin however has already said it is prepared to send mobile medical units and transport planes to southern lebanon .
this falls under humanitarian aid and does not require parliamentary approval . tricky foreign policy challenge the top-selling newspaper bild recently called the issue of whether to deploy german troops in the middle east " the trickiest question german foreign policy has ever faced . " although jewish leaders had recently expressed serious reservations about a german mission in the middle east , the leader of germany 's main jewish group said she saw german participation as a defense of israel 's sovereignty . " germany and israel are allied countries , " charlotte knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " germany already has about 7,700 soldiers overseas serving in international peacekeeping forces , mainly in the balkans , afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo . but a poll released friday found that a solid majority - 58 percent - opposed any german participation in the un force in lebanon . about one in four - 26 percent - said they would support a german role if there were a firm guarantee that german soldiers would not confront israeli troops in battle , according to the poll for zdf public television conducted last week . the end of an " artificial taboo ? " " the risks are so incalculable that i do not think that the time is ripe for any peacekeeping force , with german involvement or not , " the director of the german-orient institute in hamburg , udo steinbach , told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldiers return to israel after a ceasefire was called last week steinbach said diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting truce between israel and hezbollah had a long way to go before a un force would have a peace to keep , saying the situation in the border region was still " highly explosive . " however , if the force 's mandate were revised and its chances of success boosted by bringing nations such as syria on board , he said it would be only natural for germany to play a role . " participation in this force would mean -lrb- germany -rrb- acting like a normal country in the middle east , with all the risks that entails , " he said . henning riecke , an analyst at the german council on foreign relations , said involvement in a un force would mark the end of an " artificial taboo " because the postwar german army had already embarked on deployments abroad in the 1990s . " the bundeswehr is already present around the world and that is largely accepted by the german people , " he told afp . " in two or three years we will have forgotten the debate about german participation and will be talking about the difficulty the force is having in accomplishing its goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.08.2006 steinmeier reasserts germany 's pledge to afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main mission is reconstruction but increased attacks have put troops on alert german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier began his first visit to afghanistan by urging the international community not to forget the war-torn country and reiterating germany 's own commitment . considering the recent upsurge in combat between nato forces and the resurgent taliban in afghanistan , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's remarks from kabul on sunday that the international community should not forget about afghanistan 's plight because of the crisis in lebanon should not have been necessary . despite fresh outbreaks of heavy fighting in the war-torn country , afghanistan has slipped down the agenda as more high-profile and politically volatile conflicts have taken center stage .
steinmeier 's comments , therefore , were far from redundant . germany 's top diplomat began a three-day visit to the insurgency-wracked country late on sunday , his first to afghanistan , during which he will meet with president hamid karzai and other officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will get his first taste of afghanistan steinmeier will also visit germany 's military bases in the northern cities of mazar-i-sharif , kunduz and faizabad where some 2,850 german troops are based as part of the nato-led international stability and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany took over the command of the 21,000-strong isaf in june . the foreign minister will visit the new german headquarters at mazar-i-sharif and the german reconstruction team in kunduz . resilient in the face of increasing dangers while the german contingent is based in the more stable areas of the country , everything in afghanistan is relative .
considering that the country is going through its worst bout of violence since the ouster of the hard-line taliban regime in us-led invasion in late 2001 , german troops are hardly based in a peaceful idyll in the hindukush . but steinmeier insisted that germany 's resolve was strong .
" our engagement in afghanistan is long-lasting , " he told reporters on his arrival in the afghan capital , and pledged germany 's continued support and involvement in the reconstruction of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is one of the army 's biggest missions jens plötner , a foreign ministry spokesman , echoed steinmeier 's pledge .
" afghanistan remains one of the main focuses of german foreign affairs .
we have one of our biggest reconstruction projects worldwide based there , as well as one of our biggest military presences . " however , before leaving for kabul , steinmeier told the bild am sonntag newspaper that germany was concerned about the worsening security situation in afghanistan .
" the security situation in afghanistan has deteriorated , " he said . most violent phase since 2001 that was highlighted over the weekend when british ground troops and attack helicopters had to come to the aid of afghan forces which were engaged in a bloody battle with insurgents in the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung in kabul while the german troops in the relatively peaceful north have a reconstruction mandate , the dangers for the bundeswehr in afghanistan have increased of late .
in july , during a visit by defense minister franz-josef jung , german bases came under attack and jung was told by senior officers that the threat to german forces from " improvised explosive devices " -lrb- ied -rrb- and taliban missiles was increasing .

steinmeier 's comments , therefore , were far from redundant . germany 's top diplomat began a three-day visit to the insurgency-wracked country late on sunday , his first to afghanistan , during which he will meet with president hamid karzai and other officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will get his first taste of afghanistan steinmeier will also visit germany 's military bases in the northern cities of mazar-i-sharif , kunduz and faizabad where some 2,850 german troops are based as part of the nato-led international stability and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .

considering that the country is going through its worst bout of violence since the ouster of the hard-line taliban regime in us-led invasion in late 2001 , german troops are hardly based in a peaceful idyll in the hindukush . but steinmeier insisted that germany 's resolve was strong .
" our engagement in afghanistan is long-lasting , " he told reporters on his arrival in the afghan capital , and pledged germany 's continued support and involvement in the reconstruction of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is one of the army 's biggest missions jens plötner , a foreign ministry spokesman , echoed steinmeier 's pledge .
" afghanistan remains one of the main focuses of german foreign affairs .
we have one of our biggest reconstruction projects worldwide based there , as well as one of our biggest military presences . " however , before leaving for kabul , steinmeier told the bild am sonntag newspaper that germany was concerned about the worsening security situation in afghanistan .
" the security situation in afghanistan has deteriorated , " he said . most violent phase since 2001 that was highlighted over the weekend when british ground troops and attack helicopters had to come to the aid of afghan forces which were engaged in a bloody battle with insurgents in the south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung in kabul while the german troops in the relatively peaceful north have a reconstruction mandate , the dangers for the bundeswehr in afghanistan have increased of late .

the financial times deutschland daily and der spiegel newsmagazine had previously reported he would be transferred to germany in august . berlin had refused american demands that kurnaz be put under round-the-clock surveillance and his passport confiscated , according to der spiegel .
the magazine also reported that berlin had rejected a us request to take in additional guantanamo bay prisoners . the german government neither confirmed nor denied reports of kurnaz ' impending release from the us prison for terror suspects .

" i would be really happy for kurnaz " -lrb- if he were released -rrb- , said docke in an interview with ap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.08.2006 eu calls on deutsche telekom to open up broadband market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's dominance of high-speed access has kept prices relatively high in germany the european commission has said the former telephone monopoly must give competitors more access to its network in order to spur competition in germany 's high-speed internet access market . the commission , which is also europe 's top telecoms watchdog , said on monday that deutsche telekom must offer its bitstream web access , which competitors use to sell internet services to consumers , at prices approved by regulators . " to open the german broadband markets to competition will lead to better services and lower internet prices for consumers , " said viviane reding , the eu telecommunications commissioner , in a statement . in a letter sent today to the german telecoms regulator , the bu n des n etzage n tur , the commission asked that the proposals be implemented " without further delay . "
it could force deutsche telekom , which is 31.3-percent owned by the germany government , to make broadband internet access available to competitors by the end of the year . broadband internet connections make possible data-heavy computer applications such as music , video and phone calls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is not anxious to open up its network if rivals do take up the offer , it would almost certainly result in lower prices for consumers .
deutsche telekom customers pay around 40 euros -lrb- $ 51.24 -rrb- per month for unlimited broadband service while customers of the british telecoms operator bt pay as little as $ 18.72 per month for similar service . in july 2003 , the commission passed a directive requiring member states to compel dominant former telecoms monopolies to sell wholesale access to competitors at the bitstream level , which would give them the ability to offer the same phone and data services at the network owners at competitive prices .
all 25 member states have complied except germany . the prices new entrants to the market would pay for this access would be set by the german regulator . " overregulatio n " a spokesman for deutsche telekom , mark nierwetberg , told bloomberg that the ruling is " a classic example of overregulation . "
he said that the company 's rivals have a bigger share of the broadband market in germany than other former monopolies in other countries and their rivals . the telecoms giant has argued that it needs exclusive use of the network in order to recoup its investment . deutsche telekom controls a large majority of broadband connections in germany . eu commission reding criticized the time it has taken for germany to act on this issue , saying it has been three years since the eu telecoms directive came into force but the german network regulator is only now beginning to take action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .

now it looks like murat kurnaz from bremen will return home by the end of the month , after more than four years at guantanamo . " it 's clear that mr. kurnaz will be flown to germany ; only the exact day is not yet clear , " kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke told german news agency dpa on sunday .
the financial times deutschland daily and der spiegel newsmagazine had previously reported he would be transferred to germany in august . berlin had refused american demands that kurnaz be put under round-the-clock surveillance and his passport confiscated , according to der spiegel .
the magazine also reported that berlin had rejected a us request to take in additional guantanamo bay prisoners . the german government neither confirmed nor denied reports of kurnaz ' impending release from the us prison for terror suspects .

he was then handed over to us authorities in afghanistan and taken to the prison on guantanamo bay in cuba in early 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us asked germany to take in other guantanamo prisoners too american officials suspected kurnaz of being a dangerous extremist , though a us court found these allegations to be untrue in january 2005 . both amnesty international and docke claim kurnaz was held under inhumane conditions in guantanamo , beaten and chained to his bed for days on end , reported die welt . " i would be really happy for kurnaz " -lrb- if he were released -rrb- , said docke in an interview with ap .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .
one hopes that for the congolese , because right now , there is no other choice . alexa n der göbel is a n africa expert with deutsche welle radio .

now the critical phase of the election begins , according to deutsche welle 's alexander göbel . the sooner a stable political situation is established in this country torn asunder by civil war , the better .
the recent election could mark the beginning of a new and , hopefully , democratic era .
but it has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum , since the man who has been transitional president up to now , joseph kabila , has been just another candidate since the beginning of the campaign , one of 32 . even though the vote count has reduced the number of presidential hopefuls to two - kabila and jean-pierre bemba - the tension between their claims on power and the legitimate power that election law grants them carries with it big risks .
the longer there is a lack of leadership in dr congo , the more nervous the soldiers in the various private armies active in the country become . it 's good there 's n o clear wi n n er despite that , one should be glad that there was no clear winner in the first stage of this historic election , no matter how absurd that may sound .
if joseph kabila -lrb- who got around 45 percent of the vote -rrb- had not only come out in the lead but also won an absolute majority , the capital kinshasa and other parts of the country would have likely had to go to a state of emergency just after the announcement . in that case , what happened on sunday evening -lrb- shooting broke out in the capital on sunday , killing at least five people -rrb- would have been described in comparison as a harmless skirmish .
the entire western part of the country would probably not have accepted a kabila victory - especially not at this early stage .
the country could have been divided along ethnic and geographic lines even more strongly than before . jean-pierre bemba , who comes from the province of equateur , presented himself as a true son of the nation with his perfect command of lingala -lrb- the language widely spoken in the country 's north -rrb- and at the same time highlighted suspicions about kabila 's suspected rwandan or tanzanian origins .
the calculus worked .
the east , on the other hand , which for years has been the centerpiece of a bloody war , voted for kabila because he was able to end the fighting there . careless europea n s at least as careless as bemba 's ethnic-nationalist and sometimes racist campaign was the behavior of the europeans , especially development commissioner louis michel , whose belgian nationality already put him in an awkward position . the fact that he clearly backed the current president , kabila , before the vote at the end of july will never be forgiven by the people in the west or in the capital , a stronghold of bemba support .
his statements have damaged the relationship of the congolese to europe .
they also contributed to the fact that the election commission was by many not seen as independent , but as a western vassal which had been mustered by order and with money from the west to keep kabila in office . mistrust is growi n g the word " neo-colonization " is already in circulation and one can see in kinshasa that a certain mistrust of europe is growing .
had kabila secured a victory in the first round , it would likely have become very uncomfortable for the un peacekeepers stations in the country . have the divisions and even battles just been postponed a little , just like the final decision on the president ?
maybe - but in this case , it 's important to play for time .
and one can only hope that time is on the right side of power : that a parliament is quickly formed , and that for the upcoming run-off the situation is more stable than it is now , as a democracy struggles to establish itself .
one hopes that for the congolese , because right now , there is no other choice . alexa n der göbel is a n africa expert with deutsche welle radio .

" to open the german broadband markets to competition will lead to better services and lower internet prices for consumers , " said viviane reding , the eu telecommunications commissioner , in a statement . in a letter sent today to the german telecoms regulator , the bu n des n etzage n tur , the commission asked that the proposals be implemented " without further delay . "
it could force deutsche telekom , which is 31.3-percent owned by the germany government , to make broadband internet access available to competitors by the end of the year . broadband internet connections make possible data-heavy computer applications such as music , video and phone calls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is not anxious to open up its network if rivals do take up the offer , it would almost certainly result in lower prices for consumers .
deutsche telekom customers pay around 40 euros -lrb- $ 51.24 -rrb- per month for unlimited broadband service while customers of the british telecoms operator bt pay as little as $ 18.72 per month for similar service . in july 2003 , the commission passed a directive requiring member states to compel dominant former telecoms monopolies to sell wholesale access to competitors at the bitstream level , which would give them the ability to offer the same phone and data services at the network owners at competitive prices .
all 25 member states have complied except germany . the prices new entrants to the market would pay for this access would be set by the german regulator . " overregulatio n " a spokesman for deutsche telekom , mark nierwetberg , told bloomberg that the ruling is " a classic example of overregulation . "
he said that the company 's rivals have a bigger share of the broadband market in germany than other former monopolies in other countries and their rivals . the telecoms giant has argued that it needs exclusive use of the network in order to recoup its investment . deutsche telekom controls a large majority of broadband connections in germany . eu commission reding criticized the time it has taken for germany to act on this issue , saying it has been three years since the eu telecoms directive came into force but the german network regulator is only now beginning to take action . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german palace of the republic is slowly disappearing the so-called palast der republik , or palace of the republic , which housed the former communist parliament and served as an entertainment venue for the select masses , already stands stripped to the girder .
passersby can see pieces of sky through the waning skeleton , which will completely disappear by next year - if workers do n't find even more asbestos , that is . after an earlier decontamination operation that cost millions , the cancer-causing building material has again surfaced during the dismantling and could stretch the palace 's removal to 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1993 , supporters of the imperial palace set up a mock version to get people 's attention it 's yet another twist and delay in the saga surrounding the space 's future that began soon after germany 's reunification in 1990 .
on the one side of the debate stood those calling for the preservation of the proletarian palace ; on the other were proponents of reconstructing berlin 's imperial palace , which was severely damaged during world war ii and demolished by the east german regime in 1950 . the latter group won the backing of germany 's parliament , which supports building a cultural and scientific center .
situated vis-a-vis the city 's world-famous museum island and named after german researcher alexander von humboldt , the humboldt forum would house berlin 's non-european art collections , nearby humboldt university 's science collections as well as parts of berlin 's central library .
an entertainment and convention center would compliment the complex , which would be modern on the inside while coated with the imperial palace 's historic facade . gree n space vs. you n g art but according to government officials , the palace 's reconstruction - not least for financial reasons - wo n't begin before 2012 .
a green space is meant to fill the void in the interim .
before the best landscape proposals can be unveiled in september , the makers of berlin art magazine mo n opol recently presented an alternative idea : a temporary museum featuring the works of young artists . bildunterschrift : graft architects , known for redesigning us actor brad pitt 's home , propose housing the temporary museum in an organic " cloud " structure " we want to let contemporary art meet contemporary architecture , " ingolf kern , one of the magazine 's editors , said after architects from the firms of schneider + schumacher , graft , gmp , bottega + erhardt and sauerbruch hutton unveiled their sketches for a museum . supporters of the project , including former german culture minister christina weiss , say that the space is too prominent to let it sit vacant for several years .
but city officials give the temporary museum little chance of becoming reality . bildunterschrift : a proposal to build a temporary labyrinth in the square might already be taking things too far for berlin city officials " we want to use as little tax money as possible and still create a place that is accepted by the public , " said petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department .
" an art museum would contradict this ... there 's certainly no plan to put a solid building there . " a case of palace sabotage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wilhelm von boddien is the palace , " one commentator recently said while museum backers did emphasize that the structure was not meant to stay , those pushing for a reconstruction of the imperial palace said they were concerned that the project was an attempt to thwart the humboldt forum . " to me , this says : ' we 're doing the exhibition hall to prevent the palace , " said wilhelm von boddien , who has spearheaded the campaign to raise the 80 million euros -lrb- $ 102 million -rrb- needed to pay for the historic facade . while critics say that boddien will never be able to come up with the necessary funds , the hamburg businessman said he 's certain the money will be pouring in once the government has actually given the green light for construction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of people visited the red info box to watch construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz during the 1990s he also said that an information center is badly needed on the sight to give people an idea of what is planned and get them excited about the project that 's been misunderstood in his opinion . " people associate the palace with monarchy , with absolutism , " he said .
" they fail to see that people have a yearning for beauty , for identity .
we 're returning berlin 's identity ... it 's the cure for an -lrb- architectural -rrb- ensemble , which had its core ripped out . " a slate for imagi n atio n architectural theorist wilfried wang begged to differ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will future generations come up with better ideas for the schlossplatz , or palace square ?
" the palace is an expression of a lack of imagination of the political class , " said the berlin-based architect , who is a former director of the german architecture museum and teaches at the university of texas at austin . " if you do n't have any ideas , do n't build any mistakes , " he added .
" it 's better to leave this area blank for people who have a better idea , as a slate for imagination . " since the current decision makers are still influenced by the east-west divide , it should be left for future generations " without tangible memories of what that space was . "
wang added that he favored using the ground level of any future building as a covered fresh produce market with restaurants and bars .

king tuheitia , a university manager and cultural adviser , was chosen at a secret meeting in ngaruawahia village .
he is the eldest son of the previous monarch , te arikinui dame te atairangikaahu , who died last week .
dame te ata held the throne for 40 years , making her the longest-serving monarch in the 150 years since the maori began choosing their leaders .
public approval king tuheitia has a wife , te atawhai , and three children .
he is the seventh maori monarch - all are from the same family line and were each chosen by maori leaders from other tribes .
in pictures : the funeral his naming and enthronement happened shortly before the funeral of his mother dame te ata , who died at 75 .
thousands of maori had gathered at the traditional meeting place in ngaruawahia for both events and before king tuheitia was crowned , the crowd was asked if he should become monarch .
having been given the people 's approval he was then crowned in a simple ceremony which involved him being tapped on the head with a bible - the same bible was used to crown the six previous maori monarchs .
then , wearing his late mother 's feather cloak , king tuheitia joined her funeral service .
the service was attended by new zealand prime minister helen clark and two former prime ministers .
during the ceremony messages from queen elizabeth ii , who is new zealand 's head of state , pope benedict xvi and several pacific leaders were read out .
her coffin was then taken several kilometres along the waikato river by maori canoe to taupiri mountain , the sacred burial place of the tainui tribe , where dame te ata will be interred alongside her predecessors .

the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- said there was insufficient evidence to recommend avastin and erbitux .
but charities say both drugs are the best option for seriously ill patients whose cancer has spread .
they say the drugs have been shown to extend life expectancy by four to five months in some patients .
a similar decision has already been made in scotland .
bowel cancer kills almost 50 people a day in the uk .
each year , there are about 18,700 new cases in men , and nearly 16,200 cases in women .
it is easily treatable , but only if caught in its early stages .
both the new drugs are monoclonal antibodies - the same type of new generation " biological " drug as the breast cancer treatment herceptin .
nice considered their use in patients whose cancer had spread , usually to the liver , but sometimes to the lungs .
this is known as metastatic cancer .
we feel extremely disappointed that bowel cancer - the second biggest cancer killer - is not being given the attention or funding it deserves hilary whittaker beating bowel cancer q & a : what is nice ?
send us your experiences avastin , known technically as bevacizumab , works by starving cancerous tumours of blood , thus preventing them from growing in the body .
research has shown it can extend life expectancy by an average of five months .
lynn novak , from crawley , west sussex , who has advanced bowel cancer , argued that avastin had reduced the size of her tumours and helped to keep her alive .
however , the nice decision could mean she will have to stop taking the drug , as she can not afford to continue to fund it herself , having already spent thousands .
her only hope is to convince her local primary care trust she is an exceptional case .
" i 'm a different person , a different person .
it 's just given me a new life , " she said .
" i was told i had six months to live in december 2005 , but i 'm still here , i 'm back at work , i 'm a productive member of society , and i feel really , really well . "
' scarce ' resources it 's just given me a new life lynn novak , who takes avastin ' i will die without drug ' how the nhs values a life erbitux -lrb- cetuximab -rrb- works by blocking the proliferation of cancer cells , and is usually used after chemotherapy has failed .
in tests , it was found to extend life expectancy by at least four months for 50 % of patients , and to shrink tumours by 50 % in a quarter .
however , both drugs are relatively expensive .
avastin costs on average £ 16,824 per patient , and erbitux £ 11,739 .
andrea sutcliffe , nice deputy chief executive , said the institute 's investigations had found that neither drug represented a good use of " scarce nhs resources " .
andrew dillon , the chief executive , admitted the drugs were of some benefit - but said there was uncertainly about how good they were compared with current standard treatments .
decision ' scandal ' television presenter lynn faulds wood , who beat the cancer and set up the charity lynn 's bowel cancer campaign , said the decision was " cruel " to patients .
hilary whittaker , chief executive of the charity beating bowel cancer , said the decision was a " scandal " and the value placed on the lives of sufferers seemed to be " minimal " .
" we are now the only nation in the eu not to offer cetuximab and bevacizumab to bowel cancer patients in the disease 's advanced stages , " she said , urging nice to review its decision .
" we feel extremely disappointed that bowel cancer - the second biggest cancer killer - is not being given the attention or funding it deserves . "
ian beaumont , of the charity bowel cancer uk , said : " nice 's negative decision with regard to the biological agents avastin and erbitux is further proof that the nhs is simply not working for bowel cancer patients and is overdue a full and comprehensive review . "
professor karol sikora , a cancer expert at london 's imperial colllege , said : " these drugs are expensive but they are effective , trials have shown them to be effective .
" the difficulty for the nhs is they are costly .
the way it is done is simply to calculate the amount of cost for prolonging survival by one year .
" the average nhs limit is around £ 30,000 .
that 's what you and i are worth to the nhs for one year 's extension of life . "
alan maynard , professor of health economics at the university of york , said the problem was nice was saying yes too much , adding to the financial pressure in the health service .
the nice decision is now open to consultation before a final ruling is published in the autumn .
all three bowel cancer charities receive financial support from the drugs industry .

the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- said there was insufficient evidence to recommend avastin and erbitux .
but charities say both drugs are the best option for seriously ill patients whose cancer has spread .
they say the drugs have been shown to extend life expectancy by four to five months in some patients .
a similar decision has already been made in scotland .
bowel cancer kills almost 50 people a day in the uk .
each year , there are about 18,700 new cases in men , and nearly 16,200 cases in women .
it is easily treatable , but only if caught in its early stages .
both the new drugs are monoclonal antibodies - the same type of new generation " biological " drug as the breast cancer treatment herceptin .
nice considered their use in patients whose cancer had spread , usually to the liver , but sometimes to the lungs .
this is known as metastatic cancer .

send us your experiences avastin , known technically as bevacizumab , works by starving cancerous tumours of blood , thus preventing them from growing in the body .
research has shown it can extend life expectancy by an average of five months .
lynn novak , from crawley , west sussex , who has advanced bowel cancer , argued that avastin had reduced the size of her tumours and helped to keep her alive .
however , the nice decision could mean she will have to stop taking the drug , as she can not afford to continue to fund it herself , having already spent thousands .
her only hope is to convince her local primary care trust she is an exceptional case .
" i 'm a different person , a different person .
it 's just given me a new life , " she said .
" i was told i had six months to live in december 2005 , but i 'm still here , i 'm back at work , i 'm a productive member of society , and i feel really , really well . "
' scarce ' resources it 's just given me a new life lynn novak , who takes avastin ' i will die without drug ' how the nhs values a life erbitux -lrb- cetuximab -rrb- works by blocking the proliferation of cancer cells , and is usually used after chemotherapy has failed .
in tests , it was found to extend life expectancy by at least four months for 50 % of patients , and to shrink tumours by 50 % in a quarter .
however , both drugs are relatively expensive .
avastin costs on average £ 16,824 per patient , and erbitux £ 11,739 .
andrea sutcliffe , nice deputy chief executive , said the institute 's investigations had found that neither drug represented a good use of " scarce nhs resources " .
andrew dillon , the chief executive , admitted the drugs were of some benefit - but said there was uncertainly about how good they were compared with current standard treatments .
decision ' scandal ' television presenter lynn faulds wood , who beat the cancer and set up the charity lynn 's bowel cancer campaign , said the decision was " cruel " to patients .
hilary whittaker , chief executive of the charity beating bowel cancer , said the decision was a " scandal " and the value placed on the lives of sufferers seemed to be " minimal " .
" we are now the only nation in the eu not to offer cetuximab and bevacizumab to bowel cancer patients in the disease 's advanced stages , " she said , urging nice to review its decision .
" we feel extremely disappointed that bowel cancer - the second biggest cancer killer - is not being given the attention or funding it deserves . "
ian beaumont , of the charity bowel cancer uk , said : " nice 's negative decision with regard to the biological agents avastin and erbitux is further proof that the nhs is simply not working for bowel cancer patients and is overdue a full and comprehensive review . "
professor karol sikora , a cancer expert at london 's imperial colllege , said : " these drugs are expensive but they are effective , trials have shown them to be effective .
" the difficulty for the nhs is they are costly .
the way it is done is simply to calculate the amount of cost for prolonging survival by one year .
" the average nhs limit is around £ 30,000 .
that 's what you and i are worth to the nhs for one year 's extension of life . "
alan maynard , professor of health economics at the university of york , said the problem was nice was saying yes too much , adding to the financial pressure in the health service .
the nice decision is now open to consultation before a final ruling is published in the autumn .

by tom geoghegan bbc news during the bank holiday , millions are heading abroad or to the countryside .
but what of the uk 's seaside resorts ?
after years in the shade , they 're making a comeback .
ah , the smell of fish and chips , the squawk of seagulls and the splash of bracing briney waves .
few childhood memories are as evocative as that of the british seaside holiday , which holds a unique place in the national psyche .
yet while domestic tourism is in rude health - with walking , camping and caravanning enjoying a revival - and flights to the mediterranean cheaper than an inter-city train fare , bucket-and-spade breaks seem to have been left behind .
for 30 years there have been repeated predictions that the british seaside holiday is doomed .
mps are currently investigating what action can be taken to save coastal towns gripped by deprivation .
but are there stirrings that the uk 's love affair with the seaside may be rekindled ?
in the first of a week-long look at beach resorts , we examine the evidence .
today 's seaside economy is rather overshadowed by its extraordinary past .
building on the gentry 's favoured health regime of the spa resort , which began in scarborough at the end of the 17th century , the creation of the railways helped blackpool claim to be the world 's first working-class seaside resort in the late 19th century .
expansion and consolidation of the country 's 100-odd coastal resorts continued , despite the interruptions of two world wars , until changing tastes and cheap flights in the 1970s signalled a decline .
the lack of investment since then is plainly evident , with architectural gems such as grand victorian hotels and art deco pavillions unloved and unrepaired .
renaissance but despite the gloom , there are strong reasons to believe the future is bright .
for a start , people are heading to the seaside in large numbers - it 's just that they do n't stay as long , says stuart barrow of visit britain . "
we 've definitely had the bottom and we 're going up - there 's a renaissance in the seaside tourism market " stuart barrow send us your seaside stories your pics of holidays past " the seaside town economy is remarkably resilient , given the rise in foreign package holidays and how suited the international market is to short breaks , " he says .
" the fact it 's still a major factor in the visitor economy is remarkable . "
growth in the mini-break , day trip and business markets have helped .
in 2005 , there were 25m overnight trips to the seaside , according to visit britain .
that figure has been stable in recent years - about half what it was in the 1970s .
" we 've definitely had the bottom and we 're going up , " says mr barrow .
" there 's a renaissance in the seaside tourism market .
" in local government planning circles , there 's been a realisation that the style of architecture of the 60s and 70s did n't work .
if everything looked the same then why go there ?
so councils are developing local identities and a sense of place . "
water quality , blue flag beaches and warmer summers have also helped , and there is a small but growing reluctance to fly , for environmental and security reasons .
and those with fond memories of childhood beach breaks in the 1970s are now taking their own offspring to the seaside .
people are as likely to head to the sea to find fossils , bird watch , shop for antiques , enjoy modern art or have a stag weekend as to lie in a deckchair or play the penny arcades .
this means newquay sells itself as a surfing town , southport as a classic resort and brighton as a hip place to hang out .
and while tastes have changed , that does n't mean the end of pier entertainment and donkey rides .
blackpool pleasure beach , in a town which embraces all the traditional seaside ingredients , is still the most visited attraction in the country .
heading upmarket " regeneration " is the buzzword among coastal town planners dealing with hundreds of redevelopment plans , many of which try to restore the grandeur of the past .
in morecambe , the midland hotel is undergoing major refurbishment and will reopen in 2007 .
and in scarborough , the spa complex where it all began is being cleaned up inside and out , one of half a dozen multi-million-pound projects in the town .
in a typical move away from tourism - what one writer described as " brushing the sand out of the hair " - the town will build a creative industries park to attract enterprise .
" instead of being a seaside town , we want to be a town by the sea , " says scarborough 's urban renaissance manager nick taylor , who believes a more upmarket cafe culture is wrestling in on the seafront 's predominance of amusement arcades .
but change can be problematic .
many older people who retire to the coast for a quiet life resist moves to attract new hordes of tourists .
and in some quarters there 's the prevailing belief that 1950s holidays were the " good old days " .
yet that ignores the evidence of better customer service , more food choices and cleaner beaches .
while seaside holidays of old were a welcome escape from urban poverty , they were not always fun .
in bbc two 's grumpy old holidays , actress sheila hancock says : " we went to ramsgate and it was the usual - as it was in those days - dreary seaside town .
even as a child i realised it was fairly dreary .
" and the bedsit place or boarding house which you stayed in turned you out after breakfast and you were not allowed to go back until the evening . "
while it 's fun to reminisce about such long-lost privations , the seaside holiday is fast evolving .

by tom geoghegan bbc news during the bank holiday , millions are heading abroad or to the countryside .
but what of the uk 's seaside resorts ?
after years in the shade , they 're making a comeback .
ah , the smell of fish and chips , the squawk of seagulls and the splash of bracing briney waves .
few childhood memories are as evocative as that of the british seaside holiday , which holds a unique place in the national psyche .
yet while domestic tourism is in rude health - with walking , camping and caravanning enjoying a revival - and flights to the mediterranean cheaper than an inter-city train fare , bucket-and-spade breaks seem to have been left behind .
for 30 years there have been repeated predictions that the british seaside holiday is doomed .
mps are currently investigating what action can be taken to save coastal towns gripped by deprivation .
but are there stirrings that the uk 's love affair with the seaside may be rekindled ?
in the first of a week-long look at beach resorts , we examine the evidence .
today 's seaside economy is rather overshadowed by its extraordinary past .
building on the gentry 's favoured health regime of the spa resort , which began in scarborough at the end of the 17th century , the creation of the railways helped blackpool claim to be the world 's first working-class seaside resort in the late 19th century .
expansion and consolidation of the country 's 100-odd coastal resorts continued , despite the interruptions of two world wars , until changing tastes and cheap flights in the 1970s signalled a decline .
the lack of investment since then is plainly evident , with architectural gems such as grand victorian hotels and art deco pavillions unloved and unrepaired .
renaissance but despite the gloom , there are strong reasons to believe the future is bright .
for a start , people are heading to the seaside in large numbers - it 's just that they do n't stay as long , says stuart barrow of visit britain .
we 've definitely had the bottom and we 're going up - there 's a renaissance in the seaside tourism market stuart barrow send us your seaside stories your pics of holidays past " the seaside town economy is remarkably resilient , given the rise in foreign package holidays and how suited the international market is to short breaks , " he says .
" the fact it 's still a major factor in the visitor economy is remarkable . "

in 2005 , there were 25m overnight trips to the seaside , according to visit britain .
that figure has been stable in recent years - about half what it was in the 1970s .

last night my computer played a song i had never heard before and i loved it .
it then played another , and another , and i loved them both .
the music was being played through a free web service called pandora .
it created a personalised , online radio station for me based on a single song i had told pandora i liked .
from that point i was able to give the thumbs up or down to each song it played me , building up a profile of my listening tastes .
tim westergren , the chief executive and one of the co-founders of pandora , said : " we try and create something of a musical journey within the context of a song , band or artist you have given us . "
pandora works by associating different songs , artists and bands together based on a series of musical attributes .
but there is not a computer algorithm in the background analysing music , the work is done by a 42-strong team of musicians . "
a musician has listened to that song and captured hundreds of little details about it which are literally scored on the song " tim westergren , pandora " they listen to each song individually and analyse it along 400 musical attributes , " said mr westergren .
" it can take as long as 30 minutes to do a single song , " he said .
" a musician has listened to that song and captured hundreds of little details about it which are literally scored on the song .
" we have a big template which you can think of as a music genome or music dna .
we compare that to every song in our catalogue .
' complicated math ' " there is a fairly complicated math equation which takes that musical information and calculates what song is closest to it . "
the whole service works within a web browser - there are no downloads or programs to install .
there are other similar services available online , such as last.fm and launchcast and shoutcast , reflecting a growing trend of music based around personal choice and networks of like-minded people .
pandora has 2.5m registered users and mr westergren said the service could support hundreds of thousands of people listening to their personal radio stations simultaneously .
the music is streamed to your computer at 128kbps - roughly the quality of a music download - and is never actually stored on your machine .
there are links to online music stores such as amazon and itunes if you want to actually download the song you have listened to .
pandora started life seven years as a project to help people find new music and has existed in its current form for just eight months .
mr westergren said : " we launched it from a one-bedroom apartment in san francisco .
it 's a typical start-up story " there was the simple intention of creating some new way of discovering music . "
pandora has more than 500,000 songs in its catalogue and new tracks recommended by users and discovered by staff are being added each day .
record labels have also taken notice and are sending music to pandora every day .
' do n't discriminate ' " we also get a lot of submissions directly now from musicians , bands and labels .
that means everything from majors to people doing stuff in garages .
" we want it all .
we do n't discriminate or prioritise because music is on a label or not .
we do have to have the mainstream as typically that is what people use to launch a station . "
but should users be suspicious if a song from a major artist pops up in their playlist ?
" we will never ever play a song on pandora because someone has paid us to play it , " said mr westergren .
pandora can create up to 100 different radio stations and each station can be made more varied and diverse by adding more favourite artists or songs . "
the home networking world right now is a bunch of small companies " tim westergren , pandora at the moment the service is limited to us owners because of restrictions over streaming websites .
in the us pandora has a one-size-fits-all licence which covers streaming copyright music but the company has to negotiate with individual record labels in the uk and the rest of europe .
non-us residents can use pandora simply by entering an america zip code during the registration process .
" pandora 's success so far has really smoothed the way for us to get that done , " said mr westergren , adding that pandora should launch in the uk soon .
the company is also looking to offer pandora as part of the digital home and mobile listening .
at the moment users of the squeezebox wi-fi music device can listen to the station via their hi-fi and there are other solutions involving downloading third party programs .
mr westergren said : " we really would like to make this an anytime anywhere experience .
the home networking world right now is a bunch of small companies - sonos , roku and slim devices .
" it 's a matter of time before sony or one of these big companies gets into that space and that 's when it will take off .
" we would certainly like pandora to be available to all those devices and make it available on mobiles or some kind of wi-fi mp3 player . "

last night my computer played a song i had never heard before and i loved it .
it then played another , and another , and i loved them both .
the music was being played through a free web service called pandora .
it created a personalised , online radio station for me based on a single song i had told pandora i liked .
from that point i was able to give the thumbs up or down to each song it played me , building up a profile of my listening tastes .
tim westergren , the chief executive and one of the co-founders of pandora , said : " we try and create something of a musical journey within the context of a song , band or artist you have given us . "
pandora works by associating different songs , artists and bands together based on a series of musical attributes .
but there is not a computer algorithm in the background analysing music , the work is done by a 42-strong team of musicians .
a musician has listened to that song and captured hundreds of little details about it which are literally scored on the song tim westergren , pandora " they listen to each song individually and analyse it along 400 musical attributes , " said mr westergren .
" it can take as long as 30 minutes to do a single song , " he said .
" a musician has listened to that song and captured hundreds of little details about it which are literally scored on the song .
" we have a big template which you can think of as a music genome or music dna .
we compare that to every song in our catalogue .
' complicated math ' " there is a fairly complicated math equation which takes that musical information and calculates what song is closest to it . "
the whole service works within a web browser - there are no downloads or programs to install .
there are other similar services available online , such as last.fm and launchcast and shoutcast , reflecting a growing trend of music based around personal choice and networks of like-minded people .
pandora has 2.5m registered users and mr westergren said the service could support hundreds of thousands of people listening to their personal radio stations simultaneously .
pandora lets you give the thumbs up or down to songs the music is streamed to your computer at 128kbps - roughly the quality of a music download - and is never actually stored on your machine .
there are links to online music stores such as amazon and itunes if you want to actually download the song you have listened to .
pandora started life seven years as a project to help people find new music and has existed in its current form for just eight months .
mr westergren said : " we launched it from a one-bedroom apartment in san francisco .
it 's a typical start-up story " there was the simple intention of creating some new way of discovering music . "
pandora has more than 500,000 songs in its catalogue and new tracks recommended by users and discovered by staff are being added each day .
record labels have also taken notice and are sending music to pandora every day .
' do n't discriminate ' " we also get a lot of submissions directly now from musicians , bands and labels .
that means everything from majors to people doing stuff in garages .
" we want it all .
we do n't discriminate or prioritise because music is on a label or not .
we do have to have the mainstream as typically that is what people use to launch a station . "
but should users be suspicious if a song from a major artist pops up in their playlist ?
" we will never ever play a song on pandora because someone has paid us to play it , " said mr westergren .
pandora can create up to 100 different radio stations and each station can be made more varied and diverse by adding more favourite artists or songs .
the home networking world right now is a bunch of small companies tim westergren , pandora at the moment the service is limited to us owners because of restrictions over streaming websites .
in the us pandora has a one-size-fits-all licence which covers streaming copyright music but the company has to negotiate with individual record labels in the uk and the rest of europe .
non-us residents can use pandora simply by entering an america zip code during the registration process .
" pandora 's success so far has really smoothed the way for us to get that done , " said mr westergren , adding that pandora should launch in the uk soon .
the company is also looking to offer pandora as part of the digital home and mobile listening .
at the moment users of the squeezebox wi-fi music device can listen to the station via their hi-fi and there are other solutions involving downloading third party programs .
mr westergren said : " we really would like to make this an anytime anywhere experience .
the home networking world right now is a bunch of small companies - sonos , roku and slim devices .
" it 's a matter of time before sony or one of these big companies gets into that space and that 's when it will take off .

' do n't discriminate ' " we also get a lot of submissions directly now from musicians , bands and labels .
that means everything from majors to people doing stuff in garages .
" we want it all .
we do n't discriminate or prioritise because music is on a label or not .
we do have to have the mainstream as typically that is what people use to launch a station . "
but should users be suspicious if a song from a major artist pops up in their playlist ?
" we will never ever play a song on pandora because someone has paid us to play it , " said mr westergren .
pandora can create up to 100 different radio stations and each station can be made more varied and diverse by adding more favourite artists or songs .

the company is also looking to offer pandora as part of the digital home and mobile listening .

mr westergren said : " we really would like to make this an anytime anywhere experience .

last night my computer played a song i had never heard before and i loved it .
it then played another , and another , and i loved them both .
the music was being played through a free web service called pandora .
it created a personalised , online radio station for me based on a single song i had told pandora i liked .
from that point i was able to give the thumbs up or down to each song it played me , building up a profile of my listening tastes .
tim westergren , the chief executive and one of the co-founders of pandora , said : " we try and create something of a musical journey within the context of a song , band or artist you have given us . "
pandora works by associating different songs , artists and bands together based on a series of musical attributes .
but there is not a computer algorithm in the background analysing music , the work is done by a 42-strong team of musicians .
a musician has listened to that song and captured hundreds of little details about it which are literally scored on the song tim westergren , pandora " they listen to each song individually and analyse it along 400 musical attributes , " said mr westergren .
" it can take as long as 30 minutes to do a single song , " he said .
" a musician has listened to that song and captured hundreds of little details about it which are literally scored on the song .
" we have a big template which you can think of as a music genome or music dna .
we compare that to every song in our catalogue .
' complicated math ' " there is a fairly complicated math equation which takes that musical information and calculates what song is closest to it . "
the whole service works within a web browser - there are no downloads or programs to install .
there are other similar services available online , such as last.fm and launchcast and shoutcast , reflecting a growing trend of music based around personal choice and networks of like-minded people .
pandora has 2.5m registered users and mr westergren said the service could support hundreds of thousands of people listening to their personal radio stations simultaneously .
pandora lets you give the thumbs up or down to songs the music is streamed to your computer at 128kbps - roughly the quality of a music download - and is never actually stored on your machine .
there are links to online music stores such as amazon and itunes if you want to actually download the song you have listened to .
pandora started life seven years as a project to help people find new music and has existed in its current form for just eight months .
mr westergren said : " we launched it from a one-bedroom apartment in san francisco .
it 's a typical start-up story " there was the simple intention of creating some new way of discovering music . "

the steamer - seen from an unusual rear angle - still runs regularly .
2 of 11 the new isle of bute discovery centre , formerly the winter garden , opened in 2001 and includes tourist and community resources such as a 90-seat theatre / cinema .
3 of 11 ferry company caledonian macbrayne 's busiest island route is to bute - in 2005 more than 1m passengers travelled via its two routes to the island .
in 1970 fewer than 500,000 travelled from the main port of wemyss bay to rothesay .
4 of 11 " welcome to the lowlands " : the highland boundary fault passes roughly ne-sw through the middle of bute , leaving one half in the scottish highlands and the other in the lowlands .
5 of 11 signs of old : there are still plenty of dilapidated buildings in rothesay , but work has just started on renovating this building , one of the old picture houses .
6 of 11 the pier 's victorian toilets have had a £ 300,000 facelift .
the fully functioning tourist attraction , costing 15p to use , has a visitors ' book with entries from america to zimbabwe .
7 of 11 the gothic castle and gardens at mount stuart - known locally as the " big house " - opened to the public in 1995 and have undergone major restoration work .
8 of 11 rothesay 's art deco pavilion used to be the place to dance .
money is being sought to refurbish it , while keeping its current function as a town hall-style community venue .
9 of 11 only a handful of prawn and scallop fishing boats remain - the industry was one of the island 's most important , along with cotton and agriculture , until the early 20th century .
10 of 11 the late lena zavaroni was rothesay 's most famous home-grown star .
the plaque on this tribute in the discovery centre reads : " so loved .
time will only enrich our memories . " 11 of 11 country walks and unspoiled beaches are a major selling point on bute ... and you can sometimes get them to yourself .

there is some discussion as to what rss stands for , but most people plump for ' really simple syndication ' .
in essence , the feeds themselves are just web pages , designed to be read by computers rather than people .
back to top how do i start using feeds ?
in general , the first thing you need is something called a news reader .
this is a piece of software that checks the feeds and lets you read any new articles that have been added .
there are many different versions , some of which are accessed using a browser , and some of which are downloadable applications .
browser-based news readers let you catch up with your rss feed subscriptions from any computer , whereas downloadable applications let you store them on your main computer , in the same way that you either download your e-mail using outlook , or keep it on a web-based service like hotmail .
once you have chosen a news reader , all you have to do is to decide what content you want it to receive .
for example , if you would like the latest bbc news entertainment stories , simply visit the entertainment section and you will notice an orange button on the left hand side .
if you would like the latest bbc news world video stories , visit the video and audio section of the bbc news website -lrb- www.bbc.co.uk / newsvideoaudio -rrb- and click on the button at the bottom of the world section .
if you click on the rss button you can subscribe to the feed in various ways , including by dragging the url of the feed into your news reader or by cutting and pasting the same url into a new feed in your news reader .
most sites that offer feeds use a similar orange button , but some may just have a normal web link .
some browsers , including firefox , opera and safari , automatically check for feeds for you when you visit a website , and display an icon when they find one .
this can make subscribing to feeds much easier .
for more details on these , please check their websites .
back to top how do i get a news reader ?
there is a range of different news readers available and new versions are appearing all the time .
different news readers work on different operating systems , so you will need to choose one that will work with your computer .
back to top using bbc news feeds on your site if you run your own website , you can display the latest headlines from other websites on your own site using rss .
we encourage the use of bbc news feeds as part of a website , however , we do require that the proper format and attribution is used when bbc news content appears .
the attribution text should read " bbc news " or " bbc.co.uk / news " as appropriate .
you may not use any bbc logo or other bbc trademark .
we reserve the right to prevent the distribution of bbc news content and the bbc does not accept any liability for its feeds .
please see the terms and conditions for full details .
back to top can i make my own feeds ?
it is possible to create your own feeds , by using the bbc news search engine .
the first step is to choose a search term , and type it into the search engine as normal .
when your search results load , then choose the " bbc news & sport " tab .
review the new results , and if they accurately reflect the topic you have chosen you can now use the orange feeds button to add the selection to your news reader , or to your website .

the tour has been beset by problems - sir mick jagger caught laryngitis , the band were censored in china , and dates had to be cancelled when guitarist keith richards fell out of a tree .
music critics in the uk press , however , largely found the band on top form .
alexis petridis - the guardian they play to their strengths : the hits delivered with as much son-et-lumiere as technology will allow .

the allegation in the financial times is the latest twist to bp 's woes at its prudhoe bay field in alaska , which has been partially shut after a small leak .
in another development , alaska 's attorney general has told bp to hand over all data on corrosion management .
prudhoe bay is the largest oil field in the united states .
it usually produces 400,000 barrels of crude oil each day , but is currently down to about 220,000 barrels .
legal action a bp spokesman said there was no truth to the latest newspaper reports , and that the company is continuing to help us authorities with their investigations .
bp says it only discovered " unexpectedly severe corrosion " on its alaskan pipelines after regulators asked it to carry out major monitoring tests in march .
alaska 's governor , frank murkowski , has already accused bp of misleading regulators over the condition of its pipelines , and some bp shareholders have started legal action , accusing the firm of hiding the problems .
bp denies all the allegations .
the firm announced earlier this month that it was cutting production at prudhoe bay in order to replace 16 miles of corroded pipeline at a cost of about $ 170m -lrb- £ 89m -rrb- .
it had previously considered a full closure of the field .
bp 's corrosion problems in alaska are now being investigated by both alaskan attorney general , david marquez , and the us environmental protection agency .

tests showed exposing baby mice to constant light keeps the master biological clock in their brains from developing properly .
researchers said this could contribute to an increased risk of mood disorders , such as depression .
the vanderbilt university study appears in the journal pediatric research . "
the potential benefit of reducing unnecessary light exposure must now be investigated " professor andrew shennan the researchers say their findings suggest special care baby units should try to minimise a baby 's exposure to artificial lighting - possibly by using a day / night cycle .
each year about 14 million premature babies are born worldwide , and many are exposed to artificial lighting in hospitals .
synchronized cells previous research has found infants from neonatal units with cyclic lighting tend to begin sleeping through the night more quickly , and gain weight faster than those from units with constant lighting .
in all mammals the master biological clock is located in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nuclei -lrb- scn -rrb- .
it influences the activity of many organs , including the brain , heart , liver and lungs and regulates the daily activity cycles known as circadian rhythms .
the scn is filled with special clock neuron cells whose activity is synchronized follow the 24-hour day / night cycle .
the vanderbilt team had already shown scn neurons in adult mice begin drifting out of a phase after the animals were exposed to constant light for about five months .
this is accompanied by a breakdown in their ability to maintain their normal nocturnal cycle .
telltale glow the latest study found that newborn mice were even more vulnerable to the effects of constant light than the adults .
the vanderbilt team used genetically modified mice whose clock neurons produced a bright glow when active .
they found neurons in baby mice exposed to the normal light cycle quickly became synchronised .
in contrast , neurons in those animals exposed to constant light were unable to maintain coherent rhythms .
however , when these animals were then exposed to the day / night cycle of light their neurons rapidly fell into line .
the scientists then exposed some mice to constant light for a much longer period - and found that two-thirds were unable to establish a regular pattern of activity on an exercise wheel .
conversely , newborn mice who spent their first three weeks in a day / night cycle were able to maintain their normal daily rhythm when later exposed to constant light .
lead researcher dr douglas mcmahon said more work was needed to establish whether disruption of a baby 's biological clock could increase their vulnerability to mood disorders .
" all this is speculative at this point .
but , certainly the data would indicate that human infants benefit from the synchronizing effect of a normal light cycle . "
efforts underway professor andrew shennan , an expert in obstetrics for tommy 's , the baby charity , said the link between light exposure and its effects on mood and behaviour were quite firmly established .
" currently , any babies who are admitted to a special care baby unit are going to be exposed to incredibly harsh lighting to facilitate care , at anytime day or night that it is needed .
" many units now try and reduce adverse stimuli including lighting for periods during the day and at night .
" as a result of this research the potential benefit of reducing unnecessary light exposure must now be investigated , as it would seem that there is a strong possibility that this could improve the development of the body clock . "
newborn mice provide a good model for premature human infants because baby mice are born at an earlier stage of development than humans , a stage closely equivalent to that of premature babies .

each year about 14 million premature babies are born worldwide , and many are exposed to artificial lighting in hospitals .
synchronized cells previous research has found infants from neonatal units with cyclic lighting tend to begin sleeping through the night more quickly , and gain weight faster than those from units with constant lighting .
in all mammals the master biological clock is located in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nuclei -lrb- scn -rrb- .
it influences the activity of many organs , including the brain , heart , liver and lungs and regulates the daily activity cycles known as circadian rhythms .
the scn is filled with special clock neuron cells whose activity is synchronized follow the 24-hour day / night cycle .
the vanderbilt team had already shown scn neurons in adult mice begin drifting out of a phase after the animals were exposed to constant light for about five months .
this is accompanied by a breakdown in their ability to maintain their normal nocturnal cycle .
telltale glow the latest study found that newborn mice were even more vulnerable to the effects of constant light than the adults .
the vanderbilt team used genetically modified mice whose clock neurons produced a bright glow when active .
they found neurons in baby mice exposed to the normal light cycle quickly became synchronised .
in contrast , neurons in those animals exposed to constant light were unable to maintain coherent rhythms .
however , when these animals were then exposed to the day / night cycle of light their neurons rapidly fell into line .
the scientists then exposed some mice to constant light for a much longer period - and found that two-thirds were unable to establish a regular pattern of activity on an exercise wheel .
conversely , newborn mice who spent their first three weeks in a day / night cycle were able to maintain their normal daily rhythm when later exposed to constant light .
lead researcher dr douglas mcmahon said more work was needed to establish whether disruption of a baby 's biological clock could increase their vulnerability to mood disorders .
" all this is speculative at this point .
but , certainly the data would indicate that human infants benefit from the synchronizing effect of a normal light cycle . "
efforts underway professor andrew shennan , an expert in obstetrics for tommy 's , the baby charity , said the link between light exposure and its effects on mood and behaviour were quite firmly established .
" currently , any babies who are admitted to a special care baby unit are going to be exposed to incredibly harsh lighting to facilitate care , at anytime day or night that it is needed .
" many units now try and reduce adverse stimuli including lighting for periods during the day and at night .
" as a result of this research the potential benefit of reducing unnecessary light exposure must now be investigated , as it would seem that there is a strong possibility that this could improve the development of the body clock . "
newborn mice provide a good model for premature human infants because baby mice are born at an earlier stage of development than humans , a stage closely equivalent to that of premature babies .

peter morgan 's play frost nixon at london 's donmar warehouse theatre contrasts its two protagonists - and asks what they had in common .
by the spring of 1977 richard milhous nixon had had all the time he wanted to mull over the implications of losing high office .
he had resigned the us presidency in august 1974 rather than face impeachment in the complex web of accusation and scandal labelled watergate .
in 1977 david paradine frost faced problems too .
the huge success of the 1960s was behind him and his many critics were happy to diagnose a brilliant career on the wane .
about the time nixon quit the white house , frost had lost his us chat show .
each man had things to prove .
nixon was pursued by the us networks to tape a series of tell-all interviews : the former president needed money quickly from tv and book deals to pay huge legal bills .
there was general surprise when frost won the bidding .
the washington press corps mocked : surely tricky dicky would make mincemeat of the one-time brit golden boy ?
peter morgan 's play dramatises the run up to taping in california and cleverly boils down what happened once the cameras turned over .
morgan has an impressive track record in turning recent history into drama .
for tv he wrote the bafta-winning the deal -lrb- about tony blair and gordon brown -rrb- as well as the forthcoming movie the queen -lrb- about blair and the queen -rrb- .
michael sheen , who played the prime minister in both dramas , stars as frost in the new play .

peter morgan 's play frost nixon at london 's donmar warehouse theatre contrasts its two protagonists - and asks what they had in common .
by the spring of 1977 richard milhous nixon had had all the time he wanted to mull over the implications of losing high office .
he had resigned the us presidency in august 1974 rather than face impeachment in the complex web of accusation and scandal labelled watergate .
in 1977 david paradine frost faced problems too .
the huge success of the 1960s was behind him and his many critics were happy to diagnose a brilliant career on the wane .
about the time nixon quit the white house , frost had lost his us chat show .
each man had things to prove .
nixon was pursued by the us networks to tape a series of tell-all interviews : the former president needed money quickly from tv and book deals to pay huge legal bills .
frank langella previously starred in the film superman returns there was general surprise when frost won the bidding .
the washington press corps mocked : surely tricky dicky would make mincemeat of the one-time brit golden boy ?
peter morgan 's play dramatises the run up to taping in california and cleverly boils down what happened once the cameras turned over .
morgan has an impressive track record in turning recent history into drama .
for tv he wrote the bafta-winning the deal -lrb- about tony blair and gordon brown -rrb- as well as the forthcoming movie the queen -lrb- about blair and the queen -rrb- .
michael sheen , who played the prime minister in both dramas , stars as frost in the new play .
nixon is the us actor frank langella - recently on screen in goodnight , and good luck and as newspaper editor perry white in superman returns .
tragic twist sheen is playing one of the most impersonated of all tv personalities , so is it tempting to send him up ?
" peter morgan has been very careful to make sure no one gets sent up - every character is human and complex , " he says .
richard nixon was the 37th president of the us langella agrees : " none of us is doing a caricature .
the great thing is the play turns inexorably to tragedy over the course of two hours in the theatre .
" you have an audience rocking with laughter and then 30 seconds later they 're on the edge of their seats .
it can turn dark in a moment .
" i did a great deal of research on nixon and met a lot of people who 'd been around him .
they almost all said ' please do n't do him as a cliche - as a crook or a drunk . '
" nixon had a tragic flaw - he could n't stop the demon voices in his head which were to bring him down .
ultimately one has to feel compassion for that , though what he did was wrong and illegal . "
langella thinks by 1977 frost and nixon had much in common : neither was short of people prepared to kick his reputation around .
sir david frost has enjoyed a successful broadcasting career " they were two men born of modest circumstances who had immortal yearnings .
they had a great desire to get to the top of the ladder - and stay there . "
the play makes it clear that frost and his producer john birt - later to become the bbc 's director general - were unhappy with the early interview sessions .
today the play 's director michael grandage believes after a shaky start frost did ultimately get to the heart of nixon , securing something close to an apology to america for what he had done .
" we take nixon on a journey from a very low point at the beginning to a newfound strength which he finds in the interviews .
he made frost do all the work , " says grandage .
" then through frost 's brilliance at a particular moment there came a turning point .
he seized it and in that moment nixon opted for the wilderness . "

a team including researchers from newcastle and london 's queen mary universities have studied red squirrel populations in cumbria and norfolk .
pox virus is carried by grey squirrels , but does not affect them , but is fatal to the reds if they are infected .
researchers said the only way to stop the spread is to cull grey squirrels at entry points to red squirrel refuges .
they studied red squirrel populations in cumbria and norfolk , both areas that have suffered squirrel pox outbreaks , and compared them with unaffected red squirrel strongholds .
squirrel refuge they looked at how far red squirrels had retreated and found the annual distance was 76 sq km in cumbria and 96 sq km in norfolk , compared with 3.6 sq km in italy and 4.4 sq km in scotland .
the reds ' decline was 17 to 25 times higher in cumbria and norfolk where the virus was present than in italy and scotland where it was not .
they said the only practical and humane way forward is the strategy of red squirrel refuge areas where the entry of grey squirrels could be targeted .
research associate at newcastle university 's institute for research on environment and sustainability , dr peter lurz , said : " we are not trying to wipe out the grey squirrel but , as conservationists , we have a duty to look after the red squirrel as it is a protected native species . "

a team including researchers from newcastle and london 's queen mary universities have studied red squirrel populations in cumbria and norfolk .
pox virus is carried by grey squirrels , but does not affect them , but is fatal to the reds if they are infected .
researchers said the only way to stop the spread is to cull grey squirrels at entry points to red squirrel refuges .
they studied red squirrel populations in cumbria and norfolk , both areas that have suffered squirrel pox outbreaks , and compared them with unaffected red squirrel strongholds .
squirrel refuge they looked at how far red squirrels had retreated and found the annual distance was 76 sq km in cumbria and 96 sq km in norfolk , compared with 3.6 sq km in italy and 4.4 sq km in scotland .
the reds ' decline was 17 to 25 times higher in cumbria and norfolk where the virus was present than in italy and scotland where it was not .
they said the only practical and humane way forward is the strategy of red squirrel refuge areas where the entry of grey squirrels could be targeted .
