they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.07.2006 possible peacekeeping role in israel still divides germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether germans would join the blue helmets on the lebanon-israeli border is under debate the prospect of german troops participating in an international peacekeeping force in israel is deeply dividing the country .
now jewish groups have come out fiercely opposed to the idea . despite the strong opinions of jewish organizations in the country against german participation in a peacekeeping contingent , members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities . chancellor angela merkel said she was keeping her options open . " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " merkel said in der tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday .
" we should do everything we can to try to secure a ceasefire as quickly as possible . " while the international conference in rome on wednesday made no progress on the issue of a multinational force to be based in israel and southern lebanon , germany 's main jewish group said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told rbb-inforadio . " what would happen if a german soldier deployed in that region had to shoot at an israeli soldier ? " he asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers with the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- treat a wounded lebanese citizen wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , also said he saw enormous obstacles to sending german soldiers to the middle east .

the price is steep : 29.1 billion euros and plenty of strings attached . spanish regulators gave conditional approval friday for germany group e.on to pursue its takeover bid for spanish electricity group endesa , insisting it must strip out a large portion of assets , particularly in nuclear power generation . the regulator cne hedged its approval for the controversial incursion by e.on into spain with 19 conditions , which media reports said meant the disposal of a third of endesa 's production capacity in spain . e.on is offering 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 36.6 billion -rrb- in cash against a bid from catalan gas group gas natural , favored by the spanish government , which has offered 22.5 billion euros for endesa , the country 's leading electricity provider . an approval with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria teresa costa , head of spain 's energy commission , was optimistic about the merger the regulators ' conditions state that e.on must guarantee supplies of natural gas to the spanish market , but they do not include a proposal that e.on be obliged to sell its german subsidiary ruhrgas within eight months . commentators had said that a requirement to dispose of ruhrgas would have amounted to a veto of the bid . referring to " major risks for public safety represented by the nuclear activities , " the regulator said that e.on would have to sell asco 1 , a nuclear power station completely owned by endesa , and give up endesa 's partial management responsibility for other nuclear power plants . the conditions also call for e.on to dispose of power stations using coal produced in spain and to commit to endesa 's investment plan in spain from 2002-2011 regarding infrastructure and gas transportation in particular . furthermore , the ruling requires the german group to sell assets owned by endesa in the balearic islands , the canary islands and the spanish enclaves of ceuta and melilla in north africa . e.on had to " guarantee supplies of natural gas to the spanish market , at least to the level of the annual quantity of gas foreseen in the supply plans for natural gas presented by endesa to the cne , " according to the regulator . eu gave e.on the go-ahead madrid has been at loggerheads for months with the european commission , which wants to discipline the socialist government for passing a law aimed at helping protect endesa from a foreign takeover , as the company is in a strategic sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo burckhard bergmann 's company is based in the heart of the ruhr valley spain adopted a law in february bolstering the power of its national energy regulator , the cne , to review mergers affecting national strategic interests .
it was passed days after e.on announced its hostile bid . madrid would prefer an all-spanish tie-up for endesa and has actively backed the rival cash-and-shares bid for 22.5 billion euros launched in september 2005 by gas natural . the eu commission launched infringement proceedings against spain on may 3 on the grounds that its law on mergers review violated the eu 's single-market rules . eu competition regulators have already given e.on 's bid the green light . afp / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves e.on bid to buy spain 's endesa in a blow to madrid , the european union has given the green light to german energy firm e.on to buy spanish power company endesa .

" we can not just protest these killings , " lochbihler told dw-radio .
' ' we also see that the international community itself needs to establish , for example , an international fact-finding mission under the protocol of the geneva convention to investigate these attacks to see if they amount to war crimes . " on-the-ground work would be helpful when settling future questions of how victims of the attack should be compensated , lochbihler said . lochbihler accused both israel and hezbollah of violating international humanitarian law .
she said that the geneva convention prohibit the disproportionate use of force .
that applied in particular to israeli attacks on civilian targets believed to have been commandeered for military purposes . attacks agai n st civilia n s must e n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese citizens find themselves caught in the crossfire the head of amnesty international 's german branch also urged the government in berlin to employ all diplomatic means at its disposal to ensure that attacks on civilians stopped . another human rights group , human rights watch , has accused israel of using cluster bombs .

a brown bear named bruno became a cultural icon and a government headache this summer when he crossed into southern germany .
now , bruno 's brother could be ambling towards the german border .
the bear saga continues . a smart bear might think twice before heading towards the german border . after all , germany 's recent track record as a bear-friendly country is n't good .
yet a bear was seen recently heading northward . the sighting comes close on the heels of the only other bear sighted in germany during the past 170 years .
an italian brown bear , christened bruno by the media , was killed about a month after first entering the country . soon after bruno showed up in germany , the lovable rascal developed an appetite for barnyard animals .
the bear was shot in june after the government declared him a menace . yet bruno has a brother .

' ' i 've been saying for weeks this would happen , " stofella said . according to stofella , bruno has a brother that was also born in northern italy , is the same age and could be on the move . any bear traveling to germany would likely face the same media and government scrutiny as bruno . the infamous bruno in just a month , bruno became a household name thanks to extensive media coverage of his antics , which included killing two dozen sheep , rabbits , goats and poultry .
animal lovers were infuriated when the government issued hunting permits .
bruno fans left teddy bears and crosses by the spot where he was killed . at first , it seemed like the dead bear might become a job for a taxidermist .
but the government decided not to stuff bruno for display out of fear that a cult would arise around the animal , werner schnappauf , the bavarian environment minister , told reporters .
the government also nixed a request by rome that bruno 's remains be repatriated . " the bear is the property of the state of bavaria , " schnappauf said , adding that the animal 's remains would be used for " scientific purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative germany -pipe- 28.07.2006 concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one in four children receives tutoring outside of class the german association of college prep school teachers says that the number of scientology groups that operate tutoring centers has tripled in the past 10 years .
they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .
also , the tutoring centers do not come under the authority of school boards .

a brown bear named bruno became a cultural icon and a government headache this summer when he crossed into southern germany .
now , bruno 's brother could be ambling towards the german border .
the bear saga continues . a smart bear might think twice before heading towards the german border . after all , germany 's recent track record as a bear-friendly country is n't good .
yet a bear was seen recently heading northward . the sighting comes close on the heels of the only other bear sighted in germany during the past 170 years .
an italian brown bear , christened bruno by the media , was killed about a month after first entering the country . soon after bruno showed up in germany , the lovable rascal developed an appetite for barnyard animals .
the bear was shot in june after the government declared him a menace . yet bruno has a brother .
and his story could have a sequel . the brother shows up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bruno set an example for the new bear ?
the bear recently seen by an austrian cowherd could be bruno 's brother , according an italian wildlife expert .
it 's normal for male bears to search out new territory if old stomping ground starts to feel cramped , alberto stofella , who works at a nature reserve in northern italy , told the neue zeitung of tirol , austria . ' ' i 've been saying for weeks this would happen , " stofella said . according to stofella , bruno has a brother that was also born in northern italy , is the same age and could be on the move . any bear traveling to germany would likely face the same media and government scrutiny as bruno . the infamous bruno in just a month , bruno became a household name thanks to extensive media coverage of his antics , which included killing two dozen sheep , rabbits , goats and poultry .
animal lovers were infuriated when the government issued hunting permits .
bruno fans left teddy bears and crosses by the spot where he was killed . at first , it seemed like the dead bear might become a job for a taxidermist .
but the government decided not to stuff bruno for display out of fear that a cult would arise around the animal , werner schnappauf , the bavarian environment minister , told reporters .
the government also nixed a request by rome that bruno 's remains be repatriated . " the bear is the property of the state of bavaria , " schnappauf said , adding that the animal 's remains would be used for " scientific purposes .

now jewish groups have come out fiercely opposed to the idea . despite the strong opinions of jewish organizations in the country against german participation in a peacekeeping contingent , members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities . chancellor angela merkel said she was keeping her options open . " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " merkel said in der tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday .
" we should do everything we can to try to secure a ceasefire as quickly as possible . " while the international conference in rome on wednesday made no progress on the issue of a multinational force to be based in israel and southern lebanon , germany 's main jewish group said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told rbb-inforadio . " what would happen if a german soldier deployed in that region had to shoot at an israeli soldier ? " he asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers with the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- treat a wounded lebanese citizen wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , also said he saw enormous obstacles to sending german soldiers to the middle east . " the dramatic historical precedent of the extermination of the jews makes any role as an intermediary very difficult for german soldiers , " gerhardt said . the premier of bavaria and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , said he was " very skeptical " about a possible german participation in the peacekeeping force .
in brussels in thursday , stoiber said the mandate for a peacekeeping force was still vague , adding that historical reasons also gave him cause for concern . duty to act but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says the country 's nazi past , and the extermination of six million jews , meant it had a duty to act . " if the mandate is clear , if it has realistic aims and if the risk for our soldiers is limited , then i think we have to consider it , " steinmeier said in the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , adding that he hoped the conditions to create such a force would be in place as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : german soldiers arrive in kosovo 's capital for a peacekeeping mission in 2005 one of his predecessors as foreign minister , klaus kinkel , who held the post from 1992 to 1998 , agreed . " if the israeli side expressly asks for such an intervention ... it would be inappropriate to refuse this request , " kinkel said . a former israeli ambassador to germany , avi primor , suggested that german soldiers could play a limited role . " it would be good if they were employed as observers on israeli borders .
but i do n't think they should be in combat units . " german peacekeepers are currently helping to police this weekend 's historic elections in the democratic republic of congo while german soldiers are also involved in the international forces in afghanistan , kosovo and bosnia-hercegovina . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid agencies : lebanon faces potential humanitarian catastrophe major international aid agencies urged all sides in the current middle east crisis to allow aid to enter lebanon as a potential humanitarian catastrophe threatened to take hold .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .
also , the tutoring centers do not come under the authority of school boards .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .

the price is steep : 29.1 billion euros and plenty of strings attached . spanish regulators gave conditional approval friday for germany group e.on to pursue its takeover bid for spanish electricity group endesa , insisting it must strip out a large portion of assets , particularly in nuclear power generation . the regulator cne hedged its approval for the controversial incursion by e.on into spain with 19 conditions , which media reports said meant the disposal of a third of endesa 's production capacity in spain . e.on is offering 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 36.6 billion -rrb- in cash against a bid from catalan gas group gas natural , favored by the spanish government , which has offered 22.5 billion euros for endesa , the country 's leading electricity provider . an approval with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria teresa costa , head of spain 's energy commission , was optimistic about the merger the regulators ' conditions state that e.on must guarantee supplies of natural gas to the spanish market , but they do not include a proposal that e.on be obliged to sell its german subsidiary ruhrgas within eight months . commentators had said that a requirement to dispose of ruhrgas would have amounted to a veto of the bid . referring to " major risks for public safety represented by the nuclear activities , " the regulator said that e.on would have to sell asco 1 , a nuclear power station completely owned by endesa , and give up endesa 's partial management responsibility for other nuclear power plants . the conditions also call for e.on to dispose of power stations using coal produced in spain and to commit to endesa 's investment plan in spain from 2002-2011 regarding infrastructure and gas transportation in particular . furthermore , the ruling requires the german group to sell assets owned by endesa in the balearic islands , the canary islands and the spanish enclaves of ceuta and melilla in north africa . e.on had to " guarantee supplies of natural gas to the spanish market , at least to the level of the annual quantity of gas foreseen in the supply plans for natural gas presented by endesa to the cne , " according to the regulator . eu gave e.on the go-ahead madrid has been at loggerheads for months with the european commission , which wants to discipline the socialist government for passing a law aimed at helping protect endesa from a foreign takeover , as the company is in a strategic sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo burckhard bergmann 's company is based in the heart of the ruhr valley spain adopted a law in february bolstering the power of its national energy regulator , the cne , to review mergers affecting national strategic interests .
it was passed days after e.on announced its hostile bid . madrid would prefer an all-spanish tie-up for endesa and has actively backed the rival cash-and-shares bid for 22.5 billion euros launched in september 2005 by gas natural . the eu commission launched infringement proceedings against spain on may 3 on the grounds that its law on mergers review violated the eu 's single-market rules . eu competition regulators have already given e.on 's bid the green light . afp / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves e.on bid to buy spain 's endesa in a blow to madrid , the european union has given the green light to german energy firm e.on to buy spanish power company endesa .

a brown bear named bruno became a cultural icon and a government headache this summer when he crossed into southern germany .
now , bruno 's brother could be ambling towards the german border .
the bear saga continues . a smart bear might think twice before heading towards the german border . after all , germany 's recent track record as a bear-friendly country is n't good .
yet a bear was seen recently heading northward . the sighting comes close on the heels of the only other bear sighted in germany during the past 170 years .
an italian brown bear , christened bruno by the media , was killed about a month after first entering the country . soon after bruno showed up in germany , the lovable rascal developed an appetite for barnyard animals .
the bear was shot in june after the government declared him a menace . yet bruno has a brother .

it 's normal for male bears to search out new territory if old stomping ground starts to feel cramped , alberto stofella , who works at a nature reserve in northern italy , told the neue zeitung of tirol , austria . ' ' i 've been saying for weeks this would happen , " stofella said . according to stofella , bruno has a brother that was also born in northern italy , is the same age and could be on the move . any bear traveling to germany would likely face the same media and government scrutiny as bruno . the infamous bruno in just a month , bruno became a household name thanks to extensive media coverage of his antics , which included killing two dozen sheep , rabbits , goats and poultry .
animal lovers were infuriated when the government issued hunting permits .
bruno fans left teddy bears and crosses by the spot where he was killed . at first , it seemed like the dead bear might become a job for a taxidermist .
but the government decided not to stuff bruno for display out of fear that a cult would arise around the animal , werner schnappauf , the bavarian environment minister , told reporters .
the government also nixed a request by rome that bruno 's remains be repatriated . " the bear is the property of the state of bavaria , " schnappauf said , adding that the animal 's remains would be used for " scientific purposes .

the metro retail chain will take over wal-mart 's 85 german stores .
wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild said mistakes were made . wal-mart moved into germany in 1998 , hoping to repeat its phenomenal us success in europe 's biggest economy . it did n't turn out that way .
from the beginning , wal-mart found its american approach to business did not quite translate into german . ' ' as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement . the wal-mart retreat from germany is expected to cost it about $ 1 billion -lrb- 794 million euros -rrb- . under the deal , metro , which is one of germany 's largest retail groups , said it planned to fold the 85 stores into its real chain .
the deal still needs the approval of anti-trust authorities .
financial details were not disclosed . us model not effective here andreas knorr and andreas arndt of the university of bremen did n't mince words in their study called " why did wal-mart fail in germany ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wal-mart workers have n't always been all smiles the authors wrote : " wal-mart 's attempt to apply the company 's proven us success formula in an unmodified manner to the german market turned out to be nothing short of a fiasco . " one example of that might be that wal-mart 's american managers pressured german executives to enforce american-style management practices in the workplace .
employees were forbidden , for instance , from dating colleagues in positions of influence .
workers were also told not to flirt with one another . a german court ruled last year against the company 's attempt to introduce a telephone hotline for employees to inform on their colleagues . high labor costs may have been a big hurdle for wal-mart germany , as well as workers who tried to resist management 's demands which they felt were unjust . one wal-mart employee told the newsmagazine der spiegel that management had threatened to close certain stores if staff did not agree to work to working longer hours than their contracts foresaw and did not permit video surveillance of their work . wal-mart germany has had several run-ins with the trade union ver.di , which represents retail store workers . understanding the locals besides running up against german labor law and tradition , analysts say wal-mart also misfired when it came to knowing the market they were attempting to crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american styles do n't always translate well " we made mistakes , " said wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild in a recent interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" many of our -lrb- product -rrb- buyers in germany were americans .
some real goof-ups occurred as a result . " " like , did you know that american pillowcases are a different size than german ones are ? " he asked .
wal-mart germany ended up with a huge pile of pillowcases they could n't sell to german customers . " if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wild said , who is from england .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " analysts said wal-mart germany 's difficulty lay largely in the numbers , with 85 stores not enough to give the brand a foothold in the german market .
merck finck and co. bankers said the chain had " limited critical mass , insufficient square meter productivity and a too aggressive pricing policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german wal-mart shoppers did n't like having their purchases bagged by others wal-mart introduced its stores in germany eight years ago when it took over the wertkauf and interspar supermarket chains .
until now , the company has employed 11,000 employees in germany .
wal-mart said its german locations had sales of more two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.55 billion -rrb- last year . wal-mart currently has around 6,500 stores world-wide and employs more than 1.8 million people .
it announced global sales of over 263 billion euros -lrb- $ 331 billion -rrb- . boon for metro düsseldorf-based metro had been looking for ways to boost its real food store chain , and buying wal-mart 's operation will give it more than 670 food stores and hypermarkets in germany .
" the shops are the ideal supplement to our current network of the real hypermarket brand , " the company said in a statement . the 85 wal-mart stores added to real ’ s 550 supermarkets and hypermarkets , could strengthen its purchasing power in the world ’ s third-largest retail market , metro said . the price metro is paying wal-mart for the stores was not announced , but metro chief hans-joachim körber said that his company is paying less for the 85 wal-mart locations than they are worth . " we have to take off our hats to körber and metro , " said wal-mart 's ceo leo scott at a retail conference in 2004 .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology .

" we can not just protest these killings , " lochbihler told dw-radio .
' ' we also see that the international community itself needs to establish , for example , an international fact-finding mission under the protocol of the geneva convention to investigate these attacks to see if they amount to war crimes . " on-the-ground work would be helpful when settling future questions of how victims of the attack should be compensated , lochbihler said . lochbihler accused both israel and hezbollah of violating international humanitarian law .
she said that the geneva convention prohibit the disproportionate use of force .
that applied in particular to israeli attacks on civilian targets believed to have been commandeered for military purposes . attacks agai n st civilia n s must e n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese citizens find themselves caught in the crossfire the head of amnesty international 's german branch also urged the government in berlin to employ all diplomatic means at its disposal to ensure that attacks on civilians stopped . another human rights group , human rights watch , has accused israel of using cluster bombs .

the eu decided thursday to step in with practical solutions for affected farmers in nine countries . in response to withering crops and farmers ' requests , the european commission announced thursday it would allow early harvesting of fallow fields for livestock consumption and pay benefits to affected farmers in nine european countries .

kienle said he is concerned the harvest situation could continue to worsen , depending on weather conditions . " dried up fodder does n't help anyone , " said eu commissioner of agriculture mariann fischer boel .
" it was important for us to react quickly to this unusual situation and make life easier for the affected farmers . " last week , seven of germany 's 16 federal states issued requests to brussels concerning the opening of fallow fields in light of the current drought .
the eu decided thursday to make unused fields prematurely available . ordinarily the fields would not be harvested until september , but the crops would have withered by that time , according to the european commission for agriculture . practical solutio n s a n d fi n a n cial be n efits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this summer 's heat could put babe 's future dinners in danger in addition , affected farmers will be permitted to defer tax and social security payments to compensate for their losses this summer , the eu said .
they will also receive subsidy advances , likely in december . farmers facing a more immediate liquidity squeeze may receive a financial boost as early as september or october . germany is one of nine european countries will benefit from the recent eu decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative germany -pipe- 28.07.2006 concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one in four children receives tutoring outside of class the german association of college prep school teachers says that the number of scientology groups that operate tutoring centers has tripled in the past 10 years .
they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system .

a brown bear named bruno became a cultural icon and a government headache this summer when he crossed into southern germany .
now , bruno 's brother could be ambling towards the german border .
the bear saga continues . a smart bear might think twice before heading towards the german border . after all , germany 's recent track record as a bear-friendly country is n't good .
yet a bear was seen recently heading northward . the sighting comes close on the heels of the only other bear sighted in germany during the past 170 years .
an italian brown bear , christened bruno by the media , was killed about a month after first entering the country . soon after bruno showed up in germany , the lovable rascal developed an appetite for barnyard animals .
the bear was shot in june after the government declared him a menace . yet bruno has a brother .
and his story could have a sequel . the brother shows up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bruno set an example for the new bear ?
the bear recently seen by an austrian cowherd could be bruno 's brother , according an italian wildlife expert .
it 's normal for male bears to search out new territory if old stomping ground starts to feel cramped , alberto stofella , who works at a nature reserve in northern italy , told the neue zeitung of tirol , austria . ' ' i 've been saying for weeks this would happen , " stofella said . according to stofella , bruno has a brother that was also born in northern italy , is the same age and could be on the move . any bear traveling to germany would likely face the same media and government scrutiny as bruno . the infamous bruno in just a month , bruno became a household name thanks to extensive media coverage of his antics , which included killing two dozen sheep , rabbits , goats and poultry .
animal lovers were infuriated when the government issued hunting permits .
bruno fans left teddy bears and crosses by the spot where he was killed . at first , it seemed like the dead bear might become a job for a taxidermist .
but the government decided not to stuff bruno for display out of fear that a cult would arise around the animal , werner schnappauf , the bavarian environment minister , told reporters .
the government also nixed a request by rome that bruno 's remains be repatriated . " the bear is the property of the state of bavaria , " schnappauf said , adding that the animal 's remains would be used for " scientific purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative germany -pipe- 28.07.2006 concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one in four children receives tutoring outside of class the german association of college prep school teachers says that the number of scientology groups that operate tutoring centers has tripled in the past 10 years .
they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .
also , the tutoring centers do not come under the authority of school boards .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .

now jewish groups have come out fiercely opposed to the idea . despite the strong opinions of jewish organizations in the country against german participation in a peacekeeping contingent , members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities . chancellor angela merkel said she was keeping her options open . " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " merkel said in der tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday .
" we should do everything we can to try to secure a ceasefire as quickly as possible . " while the international conference in rome on wednesday made no progress on the issue of a multinational force to be based in israel and southern lebanon , germany 's main jewish group said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told rbb-inforadio .

benefits levels for the unemployed were cut under the hartz iv reforms and that has clearly negatively affected children 's lives , he added . " the gap between the haves and the have-nots is growing , " he told the associated press . ursula von der leyen , minister for families , reacted with alarm to the statistics .

the metro retail chain will take over wal-mart 's 85 german stores .
wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild said mistakes were made . wal-mart moved into germany in 1998 , hoping to repeat its phenomenal us success in europe 's biggest economy . it did n't turn out that way .
from the beginning , wal-mart found its american approach to business did not quite translate into german . ' ' as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement . the wal-mart retreat from germany is expected to cost it about $ 1 billion -lrb- 794 million euros -rrb- . under the deal , metro , which is one of germany 's largest retail groups , said it planned to fold the 85 stores into its real chain .
the deal still needs the approval of anti-trust authorities .
financial details were not disclosed . us model not effective here andreas knorr and andreas arndt of the university of bremen did n't mince words in their study called " why did wal-mart fail in germany ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wal-mart workers have n't always been all smiles the authors wrote : " wal-mart 's attempt to apply the company 's proven us success formula in an unmodified manner to the german market turned out to be nothing short of a fiasco . " one example of that might be that wal-mart 's american managers pressured german executives to enforce american-style management practices in the workplace .
employees were forbidden , for instance , from dating colleagues in positions of influence .
workers were also told not to flirt with one another . a german court ruled last year against the company 's attempt to introduce a telephone hotline for employees to inform on their colleagues . high labor costs may have been a big hurdle for wal-mart germany , as well as workers who tried to resist management 's demands which they felt were unjust . one wal-mart employee told the newsmagazine der spiegel that management had threatened to close certain stores if staff did not agree to work to working longer hours than their contracts foresaw and did not permit video surveillance of their work . wal-mart germany has had several run-ins with the trade union ver.di , which represents retail store workers . understanding the locals besides running up against german labor law and tradition , analysts say wal-mart also misfired when it came to knowing the market they were attempting to crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american styles do n't always translate well " we made mistakes , " said wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild in a recent interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" many of our -lrb- product -rrb- buyers in germany were americans .
some real goof-ups occurred as a result . " " like , did you know that american pillowcases are a different size than german ones are ? " he asked .
wal-mart germany ended up with a huge pile of pillowcases they could n't sell to german customers . " if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wild said , who is from england .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education .

" if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .

the metro retail chain will take over wal-mart 's 85 german stores .
wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild said mistakes were made . wal-mart moved into germany in 1998 , hoping to repeat its phenomenal us success in europe 's biggest economy . it did n't turn out that way .
from the beginning , wal-mart found its american approach to business did not quite translate into german . ' ' as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement . the wal-mart retreat from germany is expected to cost it about $ 1 billion -lrb- 794 million euros -rrb- . under the deal , metro , which is one of germany 's largest retail groups , said it planned to fold the 85 stores into its real chain .
the deal still needs the approval of anti-trust authorities .
financial details were not disclosed . us model not effective here andreas knorr and andreas arndt of the university of bremen did n't mince words in their study called " why did wal-mart fail in germany ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wal-mart workers have n't always been all smiles the authors wrote : " wal-mart 's attempt to apply the company 's proven us success formula in an unmodified manner to the german market turned out to be nothing short of a fiasco . " one example of that might be that wal-mart 's american managers pressured german executives to enforce american-style management practices in the workplace .
employees were forbidden , for instance , from dating colleagues in positions of influence .
workers were also told not to flirt with one another . a german court ruled last year against the company 's attempt to introduce a telephone hotline for employees to inform on their colleagues . high labor costs may have been a big hurdle for wal-mart germany , as well as workers who tried to resist management 's demands which they felt were unjust . one wal-mart employee told the newsmagazine der spiegel that management had threatened to close certain stores if staff did not agree to work to working longer hours than their contracts foresaw and did not permit video surveillance of their work . wal-mart germany has had several run-ins with the trade union ver.di , which represents retail store workers . understanding the locals besides running up against german labor law and tradition , analysts say wal-mart also misfired when it came to knowing the market they were attempting to crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american styles do n't always translate well " we made mistakes , " said wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild in a recent interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" many of our -lrb- product -rrb- buyers in germany were americans .
some real goof-ups occurred as a result . " " like , did you know that american pillowcases are a different size than german ones are ? " he asked .
wal-mart germany ended up with a huge pile of pillowcases they could n't sell to german customers . " if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wild said , who is from england .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " analysts said wal-mart germany 's difficulty lay largely in the numbers , with 85 stores not enough to give the brand a foothold in the german market .
merck finck and co. bankers said the chain had " limited critical mass , insufficient square meter productivity and a too aggressive pricing policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german wal-mart shoppers did n't like having their purchases bagged by others wal-mart introduced its stores in germany eight years ago when it took over the wertkauf and interspar supermarket chains .
until now , the company has employed 11,000 employees in germany .
wal-mart said its german locations had sales of more two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.55 billion -rrb- last year . wal-mart currently has around 6,500 stores world-wide and employs more than 1.8 million people .
it announced global sales of over 263 billion euros -lrb- $ 331 billion -rrb- . boon for metro düsseldorf-based metro had been looking for ways to boost its real food store chain , and buying wal-mart 's operation will give it more than 670 food stores and hypermarkets in germany .
" the shops are the ideal supplement to our current network of the real hypermarket brand , " the company said in a statement . the 85 wal-mart stores added to real ’ s 550 supermarkets and hypermarkets , could strengthen its purchasing power in the world ’ s third-largest retail market , metro said . the price metro is paying wal-mart for the stores was not announced , but metro chief hans-joachim körber said that his company is paying less for the 85 wal-mart locations than they are worth . " we have to take off our hats to körber and metro , " said wal-mart 's ceo leo scott at a retail conference in 2004 .
" they know how to make money in germany .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .

while a german parliamentarian had to give up a job with a business lobbying group , it 's not unusual for members of the european parliament to have extremely close relationships with the people trying to influence them . had germany 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member norbert röttgen been a representative of the european parliament instead of the bundestag , he may not have been pressured to give up his position at the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , as lobbyists in brussels do not have the image problems of their colleagues in berlin . there are some 15,000 professionals from member states , corporations , private and public organizations , churches and environmental groups - to name just a few - trying to influence the eu 's decision-making process . though a code of conduct does not allow the 4,500 lobbyists officially registered with the european parliament to bribe representatives , they can , under some circumstances , pay representatives ' staff members as long as the meps disclose the details in their annual financial reports . easy access to i n formed opi n io n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here 's what you really need to know " some of the eu 's elected officials and european commission representatives say a close working relationship with lobbyists provides them quick access to informed opinions from a number of points of view on the matters facing the bloc . " it is perfectly clear that the commission 's departments and members of parliament are very interested in our assessments , " said rogier chorus of the society of european affairs professionals . " it is just as important for us to put all the information on the table .
the politicians need this information to determine if their suggestions really apply . " in comparison with the german bundestag , parliamentarians do not have large staffs to pore over official documents , leaving some eu officials to have their positions and proposals drafted by lobbyists , according to austrian reprehensive hans-peter martin , who prepared a report on the eu 's lobby apparatus two years ago . " my criticism is that the lobbyists have the power , " he said .
" they are very adept at it .
they intervene through the back door before anything is even on paper . " this allows the lobbyists a large amount of control over the issues being discussed in parliament and the commission , according to martin . " there are a lot of lazy and overwhelmed officials who are happy to get rid of the work , " he added .
" there are even representatives who gloat about having lobbyists write their amendment motions for them . " seco n d jobs abou n d i n brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is leaving parliament for another job ?
a number of the eu 's 732 representatives also have jobs outside the parliament 's walls , although a case of a mep heading up a lobby or industry association as nearly happened in germany with röttgen is not known . germany 's elmar brok , a cdu member , is the vice-president of media development at media giant bertelsmann while social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- vural öger is a partner in a travel company .
cem özedmir of the greens along with free democrat silvana koch-mehrin are among the meps who cash checks for speaking appearances .
martin , the author of the critical lobbying report , also continues to work as a journalist in addition to his parliamentary duties . who is working where can sometimes be difficult to distinguish as lobbyists sometimes become elected representatives or get jobs on their staff .
journalists can also be found doing lobbying work while meps often take jobs with the lobbying firms or organizations at the end of their terms since the people in brussels are all familiar with each other . " it is this collection , the mixing of everything , one person does some work for another and suddenly a non-elected official is doing the work that is actually there for the people 's representative , " martin said .
" it is a forced relationship and often the citizens ' justified interests are suffocated .

a brown bear named bruno became a cultural icon and a government headache this summer when he crossed into southern germany .

the bear saga continues . a smart bear might think twice before heading towards the german border . after all , germany 's recent track record as a bear-friendly country is n't good .
yet a bear was seen recently heading northward . the sighting comes close on the heels of the only other bear sighted in germany during the past 170 years .
an italian brown bear , christened bruno by the media , was killed about a month after first entering the country . soon after bruno showed up in germany , the lovable rascal developed an appetite for barnyard animals .
the bear was shot in june after the government declared him a menace . yet bruno has a brother .

the bear recently seen by an austrian cowherd could be bruno 's brother , according an italian wildlife expert .

animal lovers were infuriated when the government issued hunting permits .
bruno fans left teddy bears and crosses by the spot where he was killed . at first , it seemed like the dead bear might become a job for a taxidermist .

now jewish groups have come out fiercely opposed to the idea . despite the strong opinions of jewish organizations in the country against german participation in a peacekeeping contingent , members of the power-sharing government say the country can not turn its back on its international responsibilities . chancellor angela merkel said she was keeping her options open . " this question is not one we have to answer for the time being , " merkel said in der tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday .
" we should do everything we can to try to secure a ceasefire as quickly as possible . " while the international conference in rome on wednesday made no progress on the issue of a multinational force to be based in israel and southern lebanon , germany 's main jewish group said it would be deeply unhappy if german soldiers were involved . " many survivors of the holocaust are still living in israel and i do n't know how they would react if german troops had to act against an israeli soldier who was defending his country , " stephan kramer , the secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany , told rbb-inforadio . " what would happen if a german soldier deployed in that region had to shoot at an israeli soldier ? " he asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers with the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- treat a wounded lebanese citizen wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , also said he saw enormous obstacles to sending german soldiers to the middle east . " the dramatic historical precedent of the extermination of the jews makes any role as an intermediary very difficult for german soldiers , " gerhardt said . the premier of bavaria and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , said he was " very skeptical " about a possible german participation in the peacekeeping force .
in brussels in thursday , stoiber said the mandate for a peacekeeping force was still vague , adding that historical reasons also gave him cause for concern . duty to act but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says the country 's nazi past , and the extermination of six million jews , meant it had a duty to act . " if the mandate is clear , if it has realistic aims and if the risk for our soldiers is limited , then i think we have to consider it , " steinmeier said in the mass-market bild newspaper on thursday , adding that he hoped the conditions to create such a force would be in place as soon as possible . bildunterschrift : german soldiers arrive in kosovo 's capital for a peacekeeping mission in 2005 one of his predecessors as foreign minister , klaus kinkel , who held the post from 1992 to 1998 , agreed . " if the israeli side expressly asks for such an intervention ... it would be inappropriate to refuse this request , " kinkel said . a former israeli ambassador to germany , avi primor , suggested that german soldiers could play a limited role . " it would be good if they were employed as observers on israeli borders .
but i do n't think they should be in combat units . " german peacekeepers are currently helping to police this weekend 's historic elections in the democratic republic of congo while german soldiers are also involved in the international forces in afghanistan , kosovo and bosnia-hercegovina . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid agencies : lebanon faces potential humanitarian catastrophe major international aid agencies urged all sides in the current middle east crisis to allow aid to enter lebanon as a potential humanitarian catastrophe threatened to take hold .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- rome meeting fails to agree on ceasefire , pledges " urgency " a 15-nation crisis conference failed wednesday to agree on calling for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east but vowed to work with " utmost urgency " for a truce .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .

a brown bear named bruno became a cultural icon and a government headache this summer when he crossed into southern germany .
now , bruno 's brother could be ambling towards the german border .
the bear saga continues . a smart bear might think twice before heading towards the german border . after all , germany 's recent track record as a bear-friendly country is n't good .
yet a bear was seen recently heading northward . the sighting comes close on the heels of the only other bear sighted in germany during the past 170 years .
an italian brown bear , christened bruno by the media , was killed about a month after first entering the country . soon after bruno showed up in germany , the lovable rascal developed an appetite for barnyard animals .
the bear was shot in june after the government declared him a menace . yet bruno has a brother .
and his story could have a sequel . the brother shows up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bruno set an example for the new bear ?
the bear recently seen by an austrian cowherd could be bruno 's brother , according an italian wildlife expert .
it 's normal for male bears to search out new territory if old stomping ground starts to feel cramped , alberto stofella , who works at a nature reserve in northern italy , told the neue zeitung of tirol , austria . ' ' i 've been saying for weeks this would happen , " stofella said . according to stofella , bruno has a brother that was also born in northern italy , is the same age and could be on the move . any bear traveling to germany would likely face the same media and government scrutiny as bruno . the infamous bruno in just a month , bruno became a household name thanks to extensive media coverage of his antics , which included killing two dozen sheep , rabbits , goats and poultry .
animal lovers were infuriated when the government issued hunting permits .
bruno fans left teddy bears and crosses by the spot where he was killed . at first , it seemed like the dead bear might become a job for a taxidermist .
but the government decided not to stuff bruno for display out of fear that a cult would arise around the animal , werner schnappauf , the bavarian environment minister , told reporters .
the government also nixed a request by rome that bruno 's remains be repatriated . " the bear is the property of the state of bavaria , " schnappauf said , adding that the animal 's remains would be used for " scientific purposes .

many have requested criminal charges be brought against those responsible for the bear 's death .
-lrb- july 3 , 2006 -rrb- wild bear leaves bavaria after officials order him killed a wild brown bear has been sighted in germany for the first time in over 170 years .
after it killed other animals , officials have approved shooting the bear , but now it looks as if he 's chosen to leave voluntarily .
-lrb- may 23 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's " problem bear , " bruno , is dead " bruno " - the first wild brown bear to be sighted in germany in over 170 years - was shot dead in bavaria .
while he was considered dangerous , wildlife experts say it is time to prepare for the return of more bears .

while a german parliamentarian had to give up a job with a business lobbying group , it 's not unusual for members of the european parliament to have extremely close relationships with the people trying to influence them . had germany 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- member norbert röttgen been a representative of the european parliament instead of the bundestag , he may not have been pressured to give up his position at the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , as lobbyists in brussels do not have the image problems of their colleagues in berlin . there are some 15,000 professionals from member states , corporations , private and public organizations , churches and environmental groups - to name just a few - trying to influence the eu 's decision-making process . though a code of conduct does not allow the 4,500 lobbyists officially registered with the european parliament to bribe representatives , they can , under some circumstances , pay representatives ' staff members as long as the meps disclose the details in their annual financial reports . easy access to i n formed opi n io n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here 's what you really need to know " some of the eu 's elected officials and european commission representatives say a close working relationship with lobbyists provides them quick access to informed opinions from a number of points of view on the matters facing the bloc .

" in comparison with the german bundestag , parliamentarians do not have large staffs to pore over official documents , leaving some eu officials to have their positions and proposals drafted by lobbyists , according to austrian reprehensive hans-peter martin , who prepared a report on the eu 's lobby apparatus two years ago . " my criticism is that the lobbyists have the power , " he said .
" they are very adept at it .
they intervene through the back door before anything is even on paper . " this allows the lobbyists a large amount of control over the issues being discussed in parliament and the commission , according to martin .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .
also , the tutoring centers do not come under the authority of school boards .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .
also , the tutoring centers do not come under the authority of school boards .

the eu decided thursday to step in with practical solutions for affected farmers in nine countries . in response to withering crops and farmers ' requests , the european commission announced thursday it would allow early harvesting of fallow fields for livestock consumption and pay benefits to affected farmers in nine european countries .

" we can not just protest these killings , " lochbihler told dw-radio .
' ' we also see that the international community itself needs to establish , for example , an international fact-finding mission under the protocol of the geneva convention to investigate these attacks to see if they amount to war crimes .

" the israeli army has denied that it takes aim at civilians , saying it used only weapons and ammunition that would best hit its targets with a minimum of collateral damage . earlier this week , amnesty international called for an embargo on weapons sales to israel and hezbollah and also appealed to major governments around the world to dispatch immediate aid to civilians caught up in the conflict . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty report paints mostly bleak human rights picture amnesty international criticized western nations for focusing their resources on narrow security issues rather than helping the poor .

the metro retail chain will take over wal-mart 's 85 german stores .
wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild said mistakes were made . wal-mart moved into germany in 1998 , hoping to repeat its phenomenal us success in europe 's biggest economy . it did n't turn out that way .
from the beginning , wal-mart found its american approach to business did not quite translate into german . ' ' as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement . the wal-mart retreat from germany is expected to cost it about $ 1 billion -lrb- 794 million euros -rrb- . under the deal , metro , which is one of germany 's largest retail groups , said it planned to fold the 85 stores into its real chain .
the deal still needs the approval of anti-trust authorities .
financial details were not disclosed . us model not effective here andreas knorr and andreas arndt of the university of bremen did n't mince words in their study called " why did wal-mart fail in germany ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wal-mart workers have n't always been all smiles the authors wrote : " wal-mart 's attempt to apply the company 's proven us success formula in an unmodified manner to the german market turned out to be nothing short of a fiasco . " one example of that might be that wal-mart 's american managers pressured german executives to enforce american-style management practices in the workplace .
employees were forbidden , for instance , from dating colleagues in positions of influence .
workers were also told not to flirt with one another . a german court ruled last year against the company 's attempt to introduce a telephone hotline for employees to inform on their colleagues . high labor costs may have been a big hurdle for wal-mart germany , as well as workers who tried to resist management 's demands which they felt were unjust . one wal-mart employee told the newsmagazine der spiegel that management had threatened to close certain stores if staff did not agree to work to working longer hours than their contracts foresaw and did not permit video surveillance of their work . wal-mart germany has had several run-ins with the trade union ver.di , which represents retail store workers . understanding the locals besides running up against german labor law and tradition , analysts say wal-mart also misfired when it came to knowing the market they were attempting to crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american styles do n't always translate well " we made mistakes , " said wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild in a recent interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" many of our -lrb- product -rrb- buyers in germany were americans .
some real goof-ups occurred as a result . " " like , did you know that american pillowcases are a different size than german ones are ? " he asked .
wal-mart germany ended up with a huge pile of pillowcases they could n't sell to german customers . " if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wild said , who is from england .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " analysts said wal-mart germany 's difficulty lay largely in the numbers , with 85 stores not enough to give the brand a foothold in the german market .
merck finck and co. bankers said the chain had " limited critical mass , insufficient square meter productivity and a too aggressive pricing policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german wal-mart shoppers did n't like having their purchases bagged by others wal-mart introduced its stores in germany eight years ago when it took over the wertkauf and interspar supermarket chains .
until now , the company has employed 11,000 employees in germany .
wal-mart said its german locations had sales of more two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.55 billion -rrb- last year . wal-mart currently has around 6,500 stores world-wide and employs more than 1.8 million people .
it announced global sales of over 263 billion euros -lrb- $ 331 billion -rrb- . boon for metro düsseldorf-based metro had been looking for ways to boost its real food store chain , and buying wal-mart 's operation will give it more than 670 food stores and hypermarkets in germany .
" the shops are the ideal supplement to our current network of the real hypermarket brand , " the company said in a statement . the 85 wal-mart stores added to real ’ s 550 supermarkets and hypermarkets , could strengthen its purchasing power in the world ’ s third-largest retail market , metro said . the price metro is paying wal-mart for the stores was not announced , but metro chief hans-joachim körber said that his company is paying less for the 85 wal-mart locations than they are worth . " we have to take off our hats to körber and metro , " said wal-mart 's ceo leo scott at a retail conference in 2004 .

for barbara lochbihler , these munitions are particularly pernicious . " it is very clear that we oppose these cluster bombs because they indiscriminately affect civilians , not just the so-called enemy , " lochbihler said .

" the israeli army has denied that it takes aim at civilians , saying it used only weapons and ammunition that would best hit its targets with a minimum of collateral damage . earlier this week , amnesty international called for an embargo on weapons sales to israel and hezbollah and also appealed to major governments around the world to dispatch immediate aid to civilians caught up in the conflict . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty report paints mostly bleak human rights picture amnesty international criticized western nations for focusing their resources on narrow security issues rather than helping the poor .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .

that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education .

she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .
also , the tutoring centers do not come under the authority of school boards .

the eu decided thursday to step in with practical solutions for affected farmers in nine countries . in response to withering crops and farmers ' requests , the european commission announced thursday it would allow early harvesting of fallow fields for livestock consumption and pay benefits to affected farmers in nine european countries .

kienle said he is concerned the harvest situation could continue to worsen , depending on weather conditions . " dried up fodder does n't help anyone , " said eu commissioner of agriculture mariann fischer boel .
" it was important for us to react quickly to this unusual situation and make life easier for the affected farmers . " last week , seven of germany 's 16 federal states issued requests to brussels concerning the opening of fallow fields in light of the current drought .

" one example of that might be that wal-mart 's american managers pressured german executives to enforce american-style management practices in the workplace .
employees were forbidden , for instance , from dating colleagues in positions of influence .
workers were also told not to flirt with one another . a german court ruled last year against the company 's attempt to introduce a telephone hotline for employees to inform on their colleagues . high labor costs may have been a big hurdle for wal-mart germany , as well as workers who tried to resist management 's demands which they felt were unjust . one wal-mart employee told the newsmagazine der spiegel that management had threatened to close certain stores if staff did not agree to work to working longer hours than their contracts foresaw and did not permit video surveillance of their work . wal-mart germany has had several run-ins with the trade union ver.di , which represents retail store workers . understanding the locals besides running up against german labor law and tradition , analysts say wal-mart also misfired when it came to knowing the market they were attempting to crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american styles do n't always translate well " we made mistakes , " said wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild in a recent interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" many of our -lrb- product -rrb- buyers in germany were americans .
some real goof-ups occurred as a result . " " like , did you know that american pillowcases are a different size than german ones are ? " he asked .
wal-mart germany ended up with a huge pile of pillowcases they could n't sell to german customers . " if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wild said , who is from england .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " analysts said wal-mart germany 's difficulty lay largely in the numbers , with 85 stores not enough to give the brand a foothold in the german market .
merck finck and co. bankers said the chain had " limited critical mass , insufficient square meter productivity and a too aggressive pricing policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german wal-mart shoppers did n't like having their purchases bagged by others wal-mart introduced its stores in germany eight years ago when it took over the wertkauf and interspar supermarket chains .
until now , the company has employed 11,000 employees in germany .
wal-mart said its german locations had sales of more two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.55 billion -rrb- last year . wal-mart currently has around 6,500 stores world-wide and employs more than 1.8 million people .
it announced global sales of over 263 billion euros -lrb- $ 331 billion -rrb- . boon for metro düsseldorf-based metro had been looking for ways to boost its real food store chain , and buying wal-mart 's operation will give it more than 670 food stores and hypermarkets in germany .
" the shops are the ideal supplement to our current network of the real hypermarket brand , " the company said in a statement . the 85 wal-mart stores added to real ’ s 550 supermarkets and hypermarkets , could strengthen its purchasing power in the world ’ s third-largest retail market , metro said . the price metro is paying wal-mart for the stores was not announced , but metro chief hans-joachim körber said that his company is paying less for the 85 wal-mart locations than they are worth . " we have to take off our hats to körber and metro , " said wal-mart 's ceo leo scott at a retail conference in 2004 .

the eu decided thursday to step in with practical solutions for affected farmers in nine countries . in response to withering crops and farmers ' requests , the european commission announced thursday it would allow early harvesting of fallow fields for livestock consumption and pay benefits to affected farmers in nine european countries . " on many fields and pastures , fodder is no longer growing , " adalbert kienle , vice-secretary general for the german farmers ' association , told reporters .

kienle said he is concerned the harvest situation could continue to worsen , depending on weather conditions . " dried up fodder does n't help anyone , " said eu commissioner of agriculture mariann fischer boel .
" it was important for us to react quickly to this unusual situation and make life easier for the affected farmers . " last week , seven of germany 's 16 federal states issued requests to brussels concerning the opening of fallow fields in light of the current drought .

the metro retail chain will take over wal-mart 's 85 german stores .
wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild said mistakes were made . wal-mart moved into germany in 1998 , hoping to repeat its phenomenal us success in europe 's biggest economy . it did n't turn out that way .
from the beginning , wal-mart found its american approach to business did not quite translate into german . ' ' as we focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact on our growth and return on investment strategies , it has become increasingly clear that in germany 's business environment , it would be difficult for us to obtain the scale and results we desire , " michael duke , a vice chairman of wal-mart , said in a statement . the wal-mart retreat from germany is expected to cost it about $ 1 billion -lrb- 794 million euros -rrb- . under the deal , metro , which is one of germany 's largest retail groups , said it planned to fold the 85 stores into its real chain .
the deal still needs the approval of anti-trust authorities .
financial details were not disclosed . us model not effective here andreas knorr and andreas arndt of the university of bremen did n't mince words in their study called " why did wal-mart fail in germany ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wal-mart workers have n't always been all smiles the authors wrote : " wal-mart 's attempt to apply the company 's proven us success formula in an unmodified manner to the german market turned out to be nothing short of a fiasco . " one example of that might be that wal-mart 's american managers pressured german executives to enforce american-style management practices in the workplace .
employees were forbidden , for instance , from dating colleagues in positions of influence .
workers were also told not to flirt with one another . a german court ruled last year against the company 's attempt to introduce a telephone hotline for employees to inform on their colleagues . high labor costs may have been a big hurdle for wal-mart germany , as well as workers who tried to resist management 's demands which they felt were unjust . one wal-mart employee told the newsmagazine der spiegel that management had threatened to close certain stores if staff did not agree to work to working longer hours than their contracts foresaw and did not permit video surveillance of their work . wal-mart germany has had several run-ins with the trade union ver.di , which represents retail store workers . understanding the locals besides running up against german labor law and tradition , analysts say wal-mart also misfired when it came to knowing the market they were attempting to crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american styles do n't always translate well " we made mistakes , " said wal-mart germany 's ceo david wild in a recent interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" many of our -lrb- product -rrb- buyers in germany were americans .
some real goof-ups occurred as a result . " " like , did you know that american pillowcases are a different size than german ones are ? " he asked .
wal-mart germany ended up with a huge pile of pillowcases they could n't sell to german customers . " if you want to be successful in a foreign market , you have to know what your customers want .
that 's the most important lesson , " wild said , who is from england .
" it does not good to force a business model onto another country 's market just because it works well somewhere else . " analysts said wal-mart germany 's difficulty lay largely in the numbers , with 85 stores not enough to give the brand a foothold in the german market .
merck finck and co. bankers said the chain had " limited critical mass , insufficient square meter productivity and a too aggressive pricing policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german wal-mart shoppers did n't like having their purchases bagged by others wal-mart introduced its stores in germany eight years ago when it took over the wertkauf and interspar supermarket chains .
until now , the company has employed 11,000 employees in germany .
wal-mart said its german locations had sales of more two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.55 billion -rrb- last year . wal-mart currently has around 6,500 stores world-wide and employs more than 1.8 million people .
it announced global sales of over 263 billion euros -lrb- $ 331 billion -rrb- . boon for metro düsseldorf-based metro had been looking for ways to boost its real food store chain , and buying wal-mart 's operation will give it more than 670 food stores and hypermarkets in germany .
" the shops are the ideal supplement to our current network of the real hypermarket brand , " the company said in a statement . the 85 wal-mart stores added to real ’ s 550 supermarkets and hypermarkets , could strengthen its purchasing power in the world ’ s third-largest retail market , metro said . the price metro is paying wal-mart for the stores was not announced , but metro chief hans-joachim körber said that his company is paying less for the 85 wal-mart locations than they are worth . " we have to take off our hats to körber and metro , " said wal-mart 's ceo leo scott at a retail conference in 2004 .
" they know how to make money in germany .

the eu decided thursday to step in with practical solutions for affected farmers in nine countries . in response to withering crops and farmers ' requests , the european commission announced thursday it would allow early harvesting of fallow fields for livestock consumption and pay benefits to affected farmers in nine european countries . " on many fields and pastures , fodder is no longer growing , " adalbert kienle , vice-secretary general for the german farmers ' association , told reporters .
" the result is the acute danger that farms ' very existences could be threatened . " " a dramatic situatio n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fodder prices are rising extended periods of above-average temperatures have led to withered , useless crops and caused what kienle called " a dramatic situation . " in the federal state of brandenburg , livestock have already been slaughtered due to feed scarcity .
kienle said he is concerned the harvest situation could continue to worsen , depending on weather conditions . " dried up fodder does n't help anyone , " said eu commissioner of agriculture mariann fischer boel .
" it was important for us to react quickly to this unusual situation and make life easier for the affected farmers . " last week , seven of germany 's 16 federal states issued requests to brussels concerning the opening of fallow fields in light of the current drought .

the eu decided thursday to step in with practical solutions for affected farmers in nine countries . in response to withering crops and farmers ' requests , the european commission announced thursday it would allow early harvesting of fallow fields for livestock consumption and pay benefits to affected farmers in nine european countries . " on many fields and pastures , fodder is no longer growing , " adalbert kienle , vice-secretary general for the german farmers ' association , told reporters .
" the result is the acute danger that farms ' very existences could be threatened . " " a dramatic situatio n " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fodder prices are rising extended periods of above-average temperatures have led to withered , useless crops and caused what kienle called " a dramatic situation . " in the federal state of brandenburg , livestock have already been slaughtered due to feed scarcity .
kienle said he is concerned the harvest situation could continue to worsen , depending on weather conditions . " dried up fodder does n't help anyone , " said eu commissioner of agriculture mariann fischer boel .
" it was important for us to react quickly to this unusual situation and make life easier for the affected farmers . " last week , seven of germany 's 16 federal states issued requests to brussels concerning the opening of fallow fields in light of the current drought .
the eu decided thursday to make unused fields prematurely available . ordinarily the fields would not be harvested until september , but the crops would have withered by that time , according to the european commission for agriculture . practical solutio n s a n d fi n a n cial be n efits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this summer 's heat could put babe 's future dinners in danger in addition , affected farmers will be permitted to defer tax and social security payments to compensate for their losses this summer , the eu said .

they worry that children are at risk . heinz-peter meidinger , director of the german association of college prep school teachers , said that his organization was aware of at least 30 schools offering private lessons run by scientologists who are influencing their students .
he added that the number may be even higher . meidinger said that scientologists in tutoring centers could be taking advantage of the vulnerability of children with learning difficulties .
he warned that children with education problems may feel inferior , making them more susceptible to scientology . ute erdsiek-rave , minister for education for the state of schleswig-holstein , said that she was alarmed at a rise in reports of scientologists ' influence on children receiving private lessons . meidinger said the influence begins when a tutor or institute first offers lessons in math or english , for instance , and then changes the focus .
he said the quality of the academic tutoring itself is often very good , as well as reasonably priced . alarm bells among children or parents , however , should go off when tutors then encourage students to attend other - frequently much more expensive - lessons promising to turn the attendee into a " new person , " he said . tutoring is a lucrative business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 700,000 pupils took latin in school in 2005 there are currently around 4,000 private tutoring institutes throughout germany .
the market has boomed in recent years , likely due to the unsatisfactory grade that germany 's schools received in the so-called pisa tests carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which analyzed the quality education systems in industrialized countries . the daily die welt quoted a study by the german institute for economic research , which found that one in four of the total 9.6 million pupils in germany receive private , i.e. paid , tutoring .
that comprises 2.5 million kids nationwide .
the newsmagazine der spiegel reported that the number was one in three children . marc kinert , spokesman for the german ministry for family affairs said that as the tutoring market grows , parents need to be even more vigilant about their children 's education . " parents should always be informed about their children 's activities and carefully review pamphlets about tutoring , " he said . being informed about scientology german scientology spokeswoman sabine weber told der spiegel that " for years , one lie after the other has been spread about scientology . "
she told the magazine that she thinks it is a good thing that members of the organization are helping to repair germany 's inadequate education system . " that 's all fine and good if scientologists want to help , but they should be playing with an open deck , " meininger said . he added that if they are going to offer lessons to kids , then they should clearly state who and what they are and not hide it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spelling rules are just one thing pupils have had to -lrb- re -rrb- learn " sometimes the brochures offering private lessons may casually mention the name l. ron hubbard , but they make no mention that he is the founder of scientology , " he said . critical view in germany , scientology is often viewed as a sect or commercial enterprise with mainly economic interests . members of the movement have often been under surveillance by the federal office for the protection of the constitution , whose job is to monitor anti-democratic activities .
scientologists in germany have said they suffer religious persecution and scoff at the notion that their movement is non-democratic . " nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light in the way it is in germany , " weber said in an interview . ultimately , said meidinger , the issue is not about religious freedom . " if the courts allow it , then scientologists should be permitted to practice their philosophy , " he said .
" but even a catholic or protestant educational institution will announce its religious affiliation , " he said . he admitted , though , that the quality and content of tutoring sessions is hard to assess since it is a one-on-one activity .
also , the tutoring centers do not come under the authority of school boards .

the council decided that the serum contained prohibited substances , including those derived from pigs .
at the last meeting of the national fatwa council , malaysia 's top muslim clerics decided to ban black metal music - a kind of heavy metal .
they also ruled that it was alright for muslims to eat cheese .
but they could not make up their minds about botox .
now they have come down against it , amidst fears that it contains pig products .
amongst muslim malays , eating pork or coming into contact with pigs is a greater taboo than drinking or adultery .
the ruling is expected to find its way into malaysia 's islamic laws .
however , there is little the authorities can do to stop the country 's botox set travelling abroad to get their wrinkles ironed out .

commonly referred to as " the edinburgh festival " , the annual celebration of the arts incorporates several different festivals .
six of the key figures preview their programmes for this summer , and explain how their festivals have evolved .
art festival book festival festival fringe film festival international festival jazz and blues festival edinburgh art festival - tessa jackson , chair " in 2003 the idea to create a standalone visual art festival was taken on board by the edinburgh arts community .
the aim of the festival is to put the visual arts on the same footing as the other edinburgh festivals and to celebrate the quality and diversity of work being exhibited around the city .
it officially opens at the end of july , giving local residents a chance to see the exhibitions in advance of all the international visitors arriving in august .
the festival 's profile is growing year-on-year , thanks to the support of funding bodies and the ambitious curatorial vision of edinburgh 's thriving visual arts community .
there are major blockbuster shows - mueck , van gogh and canaletto to name a few - showing alongside work by matt stokes and off-site pieces by scottish artists david batchelor and scott laverie . "
edinburgh book festival - catherine lockerbie , director " in 2005 , a total of 220,000 people came to our festival , of all ages and from all over .
it is the largest public celebration of books in the world and it genuinely is for everyone : we have sessions for babies , the biggest children 's programme of its kind , special events for teenagers and a huge array of readings , debates and discussions for adults .
the book festival was created in 1983 , specifically to add a proper showcase for words and ideas to all the other arts which are celebrated in edinburgh in august .
the aims are to bring the world 's leading thinkers and writers together with the public and each other , along with new and little-known voices .
in 1983 there were around 30 " meet the author " events , today there are over 650 .
edinburgh is now the world 's first unesco city of literature .
this year , we have three nobel prize-winners : harold pinter , seamus heaney and economist joseph stiglitz , who is a brilliant thinker on globalisation .
the different edinburgh festivals now work together more closely than ever before - each of us passionate about our own artistic area , and together offer visitors an array of cultural experiences unrivalled anywhere else in the world . "
edinburgh festival fringe - paul gudgin , director " back in 1947 , the first year of the international festival , eight companies turned up uninvited and performed in unusual spaces , and the fringe was born .
these days obviously the biggest change is in its size .
we 're celebrating the 60th fringe this year , which presents 1,867 shows , quite an increase from the original eight - but that spirit of adventure seen in the first fringe is still strong .
we 're an open-access festival so anyone can come - and still perform in non-traditional spaces .
this year we 've got shows in a swimming pool , tree , a bus and a toilet .
it 's always hard to pick the highlights .
the fringe attracts many big-name performers but also a lot of new talent .
the exciting thing about the fringe is waiting to see what the most talked-about shows will be in august .
the recent thundering hooves report confirmed that edinburgh is the pre-eminent festival city in the world , so if we want to maintain that position , we need to be working collaboratively and pooling our strengths and resources . "
edinburgh film festival - shane danielsen , artistic director " our festival appeals to everyone , from dyed-in-the-wool cinephiles to those who might see only one or two films a year .
conscious that film is a broad church , we try hard to make a programme that speaks to as many people as possible .
the festival was originally the creation of members of films of scotland and the edinburgh film guild , one of the oldest film clubs in the world , which started in the 1930s and aimed to bring non-mainstream films to audiences .
over the years , it changed slightly , to champion foreign-language and independent film-making , while simultaneously becoming the definitive festival for quality british cinema , through the michael powell award for best british feature film .
the highlights of the festival this year include a large rosebud section .
it is dedicated to new film makers , on either their first and second feature , and attests to our support of new talent .
there is also a superb , near-definitive 1970s new american cinema retrospective , which showcases the kind of film-makers and work the festival has always championed . "
edinburgh international festival - brian mcmaster , director and chief executive " the edinburgh international festival 's audience is an astonishing mix of people .
people who have attended every year for 30 years rub shoulders with newcomers discovering the festival for the first time ; locals with people who have travelled halfway across the world to be here .
one of the very best things about edinburgh is the way people talk to each other , comparing notes about what they 've seen and enjoying being part of such an international gathering .
one of the great urban myths of the festival is that the locals all flee the city , but in fact the opposite is true - 42 % of our audience is local .
the edinburgh international festival was founded in 1947 , a great post-war initiative aimed at uniting the people and artists of europe in a " celebration of the human spirit " .
it was a huge success right from the start , and its founding principles - inviting the very best artists and companies from around the world to present music , theatre , opera and dance - are just as valid today .
another great joy of edinburgh is that it 's never the same , and the combination of events , with the fringe , book , film and jazz festivals , makes it unique in the world .
i first came to the festival as a teenager in 1962 and fell in love with it .
this year will be my last as director .
it 's very hard for me to pick out highlights - i genuinely want to see it all , and that 's how i 'd like the audience to feel too . "
edinburgh jazz and blues festival - mike hart , artistic director " i created the festival in 1979 .
there were no events like it in the uk , unlike in the us .
the aim was , and still is , to stimulate interest in jazz across the board .
have your say " the whole atmosphere is electric and must be experienced at least once . "
cp , nottingham visiting edinburgh ?
send your comments and reviews initially sponsored by breweries , the festival featured bands playing free to the public in pubs and concert halls , in the traditional jazz style .
the music has since moved into contemporary areas without losing its traditional roots .
we now feature international artists of all styles , some of whom have never appeared in the uk , together with top quality british artists .
this year 's highlights include manhattan transfer , chick corea and humphrey lyttleton at 85 , with guests .
the scottish national jazz orchestra play rhapsody in blue and the spirit of new orleans , and the festival will be supporting fundraising for the new orleans disaster fund . "

the festival 's profile is growing year-on-year , thanks to the support of funding bodies and the ambitious curatorial vision of edinburgh 's thriving visual arts community .
there are major blockbuster shows - mueck , van gogh and canaletto to name a few - showing alongside work by matt stokes and off-site pieces by scottish artists david batchelor and scott laverie .
edinburgh book festival - catherine lockerbie , director in 2005 , a total of 220,000 people came to our festival , of all ages and from all over .
it is the largest public celebration of books in the world and it genuinely is for everyone : we have sessions for babies , the biggest children 's programme of its kind , special events for teenagers and a huge array of readings , debates and discussions for adults .
the book festival was created in 1983 , specifically to add a proper showcase for words and ideas to all the other arts which are celebrated in edinburgh in august .
the aims are to bring the world 's leading thinkers and writers together with the public and each other , along with new and little-known voices .
the book festival is offering an audience with crime writer pd james in 1983 there were around 30 " meet the author " events , today there are over 650 .
edinburgh is now the world 's first unesco city of literature .
this year , we have three nobel prize-winners : harold pinter , seamus heaney and economist joseph stiglitz , who is a brilliant thinker on globalisation .
the different edinburgh festivals now work together more closely than ever before - each of us passionate about our own artistic area , and together offer visitors an array of cultural experiences unrivalled anywhere else in the world .
edinburgh festival fringe - paul gudgin , director back in 1947 , the first year of the international festival , eight companies turned up uninvited and performed in unusual spaces , and the fringe was born .
the fringe festival offers stand-up comedy , theatre and music shows these days obviously the biggest change is in its size .
we 're celebrating the 60th fringe this year , which presents 1,867 shows , quite an increase from the original eight - but that spirit of adventure seen in the first fringe is still strong .
we 're an open-access festival so anyone can come - and still perform in non-traditional spaces .
this year we 've got shows in a swimming pool , tree , a bus and a toilet .
it 's always hard to pick the highlights .
the fringe attracts many big-name performers but also a lot of new talent .
the exciting thing about the fringe is waiting to see what the most talked-about shows will be in august .
the recent thundering hooves report confirmed that edinburgh is the pre-eminent festival city in the world , so if we want to maintain that position , we need to be working collaboratively and pooling our strengths and resources .
edinburgh film festival - shane danielsen , artistic director our festival appeals to everyone , from dyed-in-the-wool cinephiles to those who might see only one or two films a year .
conscious that film is a broad church , we try hard to make a programme that speaks to as many people as possible .
the festival was originally the creation of members of films of scotland and the edinburgh film guild , one of the oldest film clubs in the world , which started in the 1930s and aimed to bring non-mainstream films to audiences .
richard e grant 's wah-wah had its world premiere in edinburgh in 2005 over the years , it changed slightly , to champion foreign-language and independent film-making , while simultaneously becoming the definitive festival for quality british cinema , through the michael powell award for best british feature film .
the highlights of the festival this year include a large rosebud section .
it is dedicated to new film makers , on either their first and second feature , and attests to our support of new talent .
there is also a superb , near-definitive 1970s new american cinema retrospective , which showcases the kind of film-makers and work the festival has always championed .
edinburgh international festival - brian mcmaster , director and chief executive the edinburgh international festival 's audience is an astonishing mix of people .
people who have attended every year for 30 years rub shoulders with newcomers discovering the festival for the first time ; locals with people who have travelled halfway across the world to be here .
one of the very best things about edinburgh is the way people talk to each other , comparing notes about what they 've seen and enjoying being part of such an international gathering .
each festival attracts visitors and performers from around the world one of the great urban myths of the festival is that the locals all flee the city , but in fact the opposite is true - 42 % of our audience is local .
the edinburgh international festival was founded in 1947 , a great post-war initiative aimed at uniting the people and artists of europe in a " celebration of the human spirit " .
it was a huge success right from the start , and its founding principles - inviting the very best artists and companies from around the world to present music , theatre , opera and dance - are just as valid today .
another great joy of edinburgh is that it 's never the same , and the combination of events , with the fringe , book , film and jazz festivals , makes it unique in the world .
i first came to the festival as a teenager in 1962 and fell in love with it .
this year will be my last as director .
it 's very hard for me to pick out highlights - i genuinely want to see it all , and that 's how i 'd like the audience to feel too .
edinburgh jazz and blues festival - mike hart , artistic director i created the festival in 1979 .
there were no events like it in the uk , unlike in the us .
the aim was , and still is , to stimulate interest in jazz across the board .
have your say the whole atmosphere is electric and must be experienced at least once .

one of the very best things about edinburgh is the way people talk to each other , comparing notes about what they 've seen and enjoying being part of such an international gathering .
each festival attracts visitors and performers from around the world one of the great urban myths of the festival is that the locals all flee the city , but in fact the opposite is true - 42 % of our audience is local .
the edinburgh international festival was founded in 1947 , a great post-war initiative aimed at uniting the people and artists of europe in a " celebration of the human spirit " .
it was a huge success right from the start , and its founding principles - inviting the very best artists and companies from around the world to present music , theatre , opera and dance - are just as valid today .
another great joy of edinburgh is that it 's never the same , and the combination of events , with the fringe , book , film and jazz festivals , makes it unique in the world .
i first came to the festival as a teenager in 1962 and fell in love with it .
this year will be my last as director .
it 's very hard for me to pick out highlights - i genuinely want to see it all , and that 's how i 'd like the audience to feel too .
edinburgh jazz and blues festival - mike hart , artistic director i created the festival in 1979 .
there were no events like it in the uk , unlike in the us .
the aim was , and still is , to stimulate interest in jazz across the board .
have your say the whole atmosphere is electric and must be experienced at least once .

commonly referred to as " the edinburgh festival " , the annual celebration of the arts incorporates several different festivals .
six of the key figures preview their programmes for this summer , and explain how their festivals have evolved .
art festival one of the newest festivals , highlighting the visual arts book festival audiences with award-winning poets , authors and writers festival fringe an array of comedy , theatre and music film festival new and classic movies , championing independent cinema international festival the best in classical music , ballet , theatre and opera jazz and blues festival with musicians from around the world edinburgh art festival - tessa jackson , chair in 2003 the idea to create a standalone visual art festival was taken on board by the edinburgh arts community .
the aim of the festival is to put the visual arts on the same footing as the other edinburgh festivals and to celebrate the quality and diversity of work being exhibited around the city .
the work of becks ' futures winner matt stokes is on show in edinburgh it officially opens at the end of july , giving local residents a chance to see the exhibitions in advance of all the international visitors arriving in august .
the festival 's profile is growing year-on-year , thanks to the support of funding bodies and the ambitious curatorial vision of edinburgh 's thriving visual arts community .
there are major blockbuster shows - mueck , van gogh and canaletto to name a few - showing alongside work by matt stokes and off-site pieces by scottish artists david batchelor and scott laverie .
edinburgh book festival - catherine lockerbie , director in 2005 , a total of 220,000 people came to our festival , of all ages and from all over .
it is the largest public celebration of books in the world and it genuinely is for everyone : we have sessions for babies , the biggest children 's programme of its kind , special events for teenagers and a huge array of readings , debates and discussions for adults .
the book festival was created in 1983 , specifically to add a proper showcase for words and ideas to all the other arts which are celebrated in edinburgh in august .
the aims are to bring the world 's leading thinkers and writers together with the public and each other , along with new and little-known voices .
the book festival is offering an audience with crime writer pd james in 1983 there were around 30 " meet the author " events , today there are over 650 .
edinburgh is now the world 's first unesco city of literature .
this year , we have three nobel prize-winners : harold pinter , seamus heaney and economist joseph stiglitz , who is a brilliant thinker on globalisation .
the different edinburgh festivals now work together more closely than ever before - each of us passionate about our own artistic area , and together offer visitors an array of cultural experiences unrivalled anywhere else in the world .
edinburgh festival fringe - paul gudgin , director back in 1947 , the first year of the international festival , eight companies turned up uninvited and performed in unusual spaces , and the fringe was born .
the fringe festival offers stand-up comedy , theatre and music shows these days obviously the biggest change is in its size .
we 're celebrating the 60th fringe this year , which presents 1,867 shows , quite an increase from the original eight - but that spirit of adventure seen in the first fringe is still strong .
we 're an open-access festival so anyone can come - and still perform in non-traditional spaces .
this year we 've got shows in a swimming pool , tree , a bus and a toilet .
it 's always hard to pick the highlights .
the fringe attracts many big-name performers but also a lot of new talent .
the exciting thing about the fringe is waiting to see what the most talked-about shows will be in august .
the recent thundering hooves report confirmed that edinburgh is the pre-eminent festival city in the world , so if we want to maintain that position , we need to be working collaboratively and pooling our strengths and resources .
edinburgh film festival - shane danielsen , artistic director our festival appeals to everyone , from dyed-in-the-wool cinephiles to those who might see only one or two films a year .
conscious that film is a broad church , we try hard to make a programme that speaks to as many people as possible .
the festival was originally the creation of members of films of scotland and the edinburgh film guild , one of the oldest film clubs in the world , which started in the 1930s and aimed to bring non-mainstream films to audiences .
richard e grant 's wah-wah had its world premiere in edinburgh in 2005 over the years , it changed slightly , to champion foreign-language and independent film-making , while simultaneously becoming the definitive festival for quality british cinema , through the michael powell award for best british feature film .
the highlights of the festival this year include a large rosebud section .
it is dedicated to new film makers , on either their first and second feature , and attests to our support of new talent .
there is also a superb , near-definitive 1970s new american cinema retrospective , which showcases the kind of film-makers and work the festival has always championed .
edinburgh international festival - brian mcmaster , director and chief executive the edinburgh international festival 's audience is an astonishing mix of people .
people who have attended every year for 30 years rub shoulders with newcomers discovering the festival for the first time ; locals with people who have travelled halfway across the world to be here .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : cash machine charges bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies friday , 28 july 2006 , 08:03 gmt 09:03 uk q & a : cash machine charges charities have warned that cash machine charges hurt poorer consumers .
bbc news looks at why more people are being charged to use cash machines .
how many cash machines charge ?
nationwide , which has campaigned against the spread of fee charging atms , estimates that more than a third of cash machine charge a fee .
uk banks offer free atms in their branches and some other locations , while fee charging machines tend to be located in petrol stations , bars and newsagents .
overall , there are more than 54,000 atms in the uk , an estimated 22,000 of which charge .
in total , providers such as moneybox , cardpoint and hanco charge consumers up to £ 140m a year to use their atms .
there are plenty of free atms about , so why are charities getting hot under the collar ?
the research from nationwide indicates that the encroachment of fee charging atms is gathering pace .
during the first seven months of 2004 the number of fee charging atms grew by 29 % .
at the same time , the number of free machines grew by 0.3 % .
banks such as halifax and abbey have sold off atms located in petrol stations and other non-branch locations to the fee charging providers .
mps have said that they are concerned that people without easy access to transport have no option but to use fee charging atms , particularly as many rural uk banks and post offices have shut in the past few years .
in addition , consumer groups are worried that card holders are not being made properly aware that atms they are using charge for withdrawing cash .
what warnings are consumers given that they are going to be charged ?
a notice stuck on the outside of the atm alerts consumers to the fact that it charges a fee , typically of about £ 1.75 per withdrawal .
in addition , an on-screen message tells users that if they withdraw cash a fee will be incurred .
the providers of fee-charging atms say this amounts to a " belt and braces " approach and that users are aware that that their machines charge .
however , mps on the treasury select committee have said that the warning stickers are often hidden away and on-screen alerts can occur just prior to when the user withdraws cash , rather than at the start of the process .
how is an atm fee justified ?
what is the link network ?
the vast majority of banks in the uk are part of the link network each year link calculates the average cost per transaction for all providers .
this is called the interchange fee and is the amount each provider is paid for handling transactions for another company 's cardholders .
however operators that charge for withdrawals are not entitled to receive this link interchange fee nationwide says that if this agreement ended , banks would forge their own agreements causing confusion among consumers .
the providers point out that the fees charged are vital to keeping the atms in place .
if a fee was not charged then there would be no atm , the providers say .
even critics , such as nationwide , do not want an end to fee-charging atms .
instead , they are looking for greater controls over their location and more effective alerts over fees charged .
but last year the powerful treasury select committee drew a line in the sand when , in a report , it called for more prominent warning signs .
john mcfall mp , treasury select committee chairman , has described the spread of fee-charging atms as a " very worrying trend " .
mps are unhappy that the banks are selling their remote atm sites - non-branch based cash machines - to fee-charging providers .
could we eventually see the end of free atms ?
the uk 's network of free atms is unlikely to disappear anytime soon .
uk banks have pledged that they will not start charging their own customers to use branch based atms .
in 2000 consumer groups mounted a high profile campaign to persuade the big banks from charging customers for using atms .
back then , banks were keen on introducing " disloyalty " charges for customers who used rivals atms .
but they backed down in the face of a storm of public protest .
however , the growth in numbers of fee charging atms is not showing any signs of selling .

bbc news looks at why more people are being charged to use cash machines .
how many cash machines charge ?
nationwide , which has campaigned against the spread of fee charging atms , estimates that more than a third of cash machine charge a fee .
uk banks offer free atms in their branches and some other locations , while fee charging machines tend to be located in petrol stations , bars and newsagents .
overall , there are more than 54,000 atms in the uk , an estimated 22,000 of which charge .
in total , providers such as moneybox , cardpoint and hanco charge consumers up to £ 140m a year to use their atms .
there are plenty of free atms about , so why are charities getting hot under the collar ?
the research from nationwide indicates that the encroachment of fee charging atms is gathering pace .
during the first seven months of 2004 the number of fee charging atms grew by 29 % .
at the same time , the number of free machines grew by 0.3 % .
banks such as halifax and abbey have sold off atms located in petrol stations and other non-branch locations to the fee charging providers .
mps have said that they are concerned that people without easy access to transport have no option but to use fee charging atms , particularly as many rural uk banks and post offices have shut in the past few years .
in addition , consumer groups are worried that card holders are not being made properly aware that atms they are using charge for withdrawing cash .
what warnings are consumers given that they are going to be charged ?
a notice stuck on the outside of the atm alerts consumers to the fact that it charges a fee , typically of about £ 1.75 per withdrawal .
in addition , an on-screen message tells users that if they withdraw cash a fee will be incurred .
the providers of fee-charging atms say this amounts to a " belt and braces " approach and that users are aware that that their machines charge .
however , mps on the treasury select committee have said that the warning stickers are often hidden away and on-screen alerts can occur just prior to when the user withdraws cash , rather than at the start of the process .
how is an atm fee justified ?
what is the link network ?
the vast majority of banks in the uk are part of the link network each year link calculates the average cost per transaction for all providers .
this is called the interchange fee and is the amount each provider is paid for handling transactions for another company 's cardholders .
however operators that charge for withdrawals are not entitled to receive this link interchange fee nationwide says that if this agreement ended , banks would forge their own agreements causing confusion among consumers .
the providers point out that the fees charged are vital to keeping the atms in place .
if a fee was not charged then there would be no atm , the providers say .
even critics , such as nationwide , do not want an end to fee-charging atms .
instead , they are looking for greater controls over their location and more effective alerts over fees charged .
but last year the powerful treasury select committee drew a line in the sand when , in a report , it called for more prominent warning signs .
john mcfall mp , treasury select committee chairman , has described the spread of fee-charging atms as a " very worrying trend " .
mps are unhappy that the banks are selling their remote atm sites - non-branch based cash machines - to fee-charging providers .
could we eventually see the end of free atms ?
the uk 's network of free atms is unlikely to disappear anytime soon .
uk banks have pledged that they will not start charging their own customers to use branch based atms .
in 2000 consumer groups mounted a high profile campaign to persuade the big banks from charging customers for using atms .
back then , banks were keen on introducing " disloyalty " charges for customers who used rivals atms .
but they backed down in the face of a storm of public protest .

experts have clashed over the existence of great white sharks off the uk coast .
speculation is mounting amid a series of claimed sightings by holidaymakers and fishermen and a new documentary on bbc one on sunday .
marine biologist douglas herdson , from the national marine aquarium in plymouth , rejected claims of sightings .
but shark conservationist richard peirce says the weight of anecdotal evidence convinces him that great whites are in uk waters .
i very much doubt they are here now douglas herdson tell bbc cornwall what you think mr herdson said : " temperature and conditions here are all fine , and i 'm sure they have been here in the last 3-4,000 years , but they are now so rare it is very unlikely .
" shark populations such as blue sharks in the north atlantic have crashed over the past few years .
" all the intensive fishing in the bay of biscay , catching hundreds of thousands of sharks including one great white 40 years ago , means i very much doubt they are here now . "
in 2003 richard peirce set off from padstow in cornwall with the intention of spotting a great white , but returned without a sighting .
mr peirce , from bude , told bbc news : " there is no scientific evidence , but there is very strong anecdotal evidence and the case is much stronger than that portrayed in the programme .
" i am almost certain that great white sharks appear off the coast .
" my view is that there is strong circumstantial evidence that we get occasional vagrant visitors . "
lobster fisherman brian bate , from padstow , is convinced he saw a great white several years ago .
he said : " i saw this big thing breach out of the water .
" he looked like he was tail towards me .
i could see his back and as he came up he twisted sideways .
" i thought , ' what was that ? ' .

experts have clashed over the existence of great white sharks off the uk coast .
speculation is mounting amid a series of claimed sightings by holidaymakers and fishermen and a new documentary on bbc one on sunday .
marine biologist douglas herdson , from the national marine aquarium in plymouth , rejected claims of sightings .
but shark conservationist richard peirce says the weight of anecdotal evidence convinces him that great whites are in uk waters .
i very much doubt they are here now douglas herdson tell bbc cornwall what you think mr herdson said : " temperature and conditions here are all fine , and i 'm sure they have been here in the last 3-4,000 years , but they are now so rare it is very unlikely .
" shark populations such as blue sharks in the north atlantic have crashed over the past few years .
" all the intensive fishing in the bay of biscay , catching hundreds of thousands of sharks including one great white 40 years ago , means i very much doubt they are here now . "
in 2003 richard peirce set off from padstow in cornwall with the intention of spotting a great white , but returned without a sighting .
mr peirce , from bude , told bbc news : " there is no scientific evidence , but there is very strong anecdotal evidence and the case is much stronger than that portrayed in the programme .
" i am almost certain that great white sharks appear off the coast .
" my view is that there is strong circumstantial evidence that we get occasional vagrant visitors . "
lobster fisherman brian bate , from padstow , is convinced he saw a great white several years ago .
he said : " i saw this big thing breach out of the water .
" he looked like he was tail towards me .
i could see his back and as he came up he twisted sideways .
" i thought , ' what was that ? ' .
it was quite a size to come leaping out of the water . "

experts have clashed over the existence of great white sharks off the uk coast .
speculation is mounting amid a series of claimed sightings by holidaymakers and fishermen and a new documentary on bbc one on sunday .
marine biologist douglas herdson , from the national marine aquarium in plymouth , rejected claims of sightings .
but shark conservationist richard peirce says the weight of anecdotal evidence convinces him that great whites are in uk waters .
i very much doubt they are here now douglas herdson tell bbc cornwall what you think mr herdson said : " temperature and conditions here are all fine , and i 'm sure they have been here in the last 3-4,000 years , but they are now so rare it is very unlikely .
" shark populations such as blue sharks in the north atlantic have crashed over the past few years .
" all the intensive fishing in the bay of biscay , catching hundreds of thousands of sharks including one great white 40 years ago , means i very much doubt they are here now . "
in 2003 richard peirce set off from padstow in cornwall with the intention of spotting a great white , but returned without a sighting .
mr peirce , from bude , told bbc news : " there is no scientific evidence , but there is very strong anecdotal evidence and the case is much stronger than that portrayed in the programme .
" i am almost certain that great white sharks appear off the coast .
" my view is that there is strong circumstantial evidence that we get occasional vagrant visitors . "
lobster fisherman brian bate , from padstow , is convinced he saw a great white several years ago .
he said : " i saw this big thing breach out of the water .
" he looked like he was tail towards me .
i could see his back and as he came up he twisted sideways .
" i thought , ' what was that ? ' .
it was quite a size to come leaping out of the water . "

allegations of " cruising " on london 's hampstead heath were printed in the news of the world , but michael said he would not sue the paper or its owner .
he does plan to sue photographers for harassment , however , and denied calling off a civil ceremony with his partner .
but he admitted seeking " anonymous and no-strings sex " at what he described as " the best cruising ground in london " .
michael , 43 , told bbc news 24 : " i 'm suing the individual involved who i have never , ever seen , let alone wanted to have any kind of sexual encounter with , and i 'm currently investigating suing the secondary sources of libel . "
" i have done nothing this year against the law , i 've done nothing to encourage talk about my sex life " george michael he claimed those sources had added to " rupert murdoch 's story " by saying his long-term partner kenny goss had called off their civil partnership ceremony - but when he had received £ 1 million , he had reconsidered holding the event .
" these are things that are not really acceptable , " michael said .
however , he said he was not prepared to sue the news of the world or mr murdoch .
" i 'm not talking about money , i 'm talking about -lsb- whether -rsb- you want to be destroyed . "
' little bit strange ' he said he was taking legal action against the photographers " because they 're harassing me and i should not have to worry about who 's watching me at 2.30 in the morning " .
he said he was " sick " of coverage of his private life . "
a very large part of the male population , gay or straight , totally understands the idea of anonymous and no-strings sex " george michael " i have done nothing this year against the law , i 've done nothing to encourage talk about my sex life .
" the question is not whether i bring it to the public , but it is why do i have to defend it in public because i do n't want to talk about it at all . "
regarding his nocturnal activities in north london , he said : " i do n't know anybody who actually goes to hampstead heath at two o 'clock in the morning for anything other than the reason of playing about with another member of the human race .
" if they are there , then they are a little bit strange or they just do n't know the local area . "
he went on : " a very large part of the male population , gay or straight , totally understands the idea of anonymous and no-strings sex .
" the fact that i choose to do that on a warm night in the best cruising ground in london - which happens to be about half a mile from my home - i do n't think would be that shocking to that many gay people , " he said .
" until such time as the straight world is not attacking people for cruising , i 'd say the gay world could actually keep that to themselves , just for a little bit longer . "
michael 's problems with the law include being cautioned by police in march for possessing cannabis following his arrest in london 's west end in february .
he had been found by police asleep at the wheel of his car .
in 1998 he was arrested in a public toilet in los angeles after attempting to solicit an undercover police officer .
his conviction for lewd conduct resulted in a $ 450 -lrb- £ 270 -rrb- fine and 80 hours of community service .

it was on 29 july last year that the 18-year-old was killed with an ice axe in mcgoldrick park in huyton , merseyside .
cousins michael barton , 20 , and paul taylor , 17 , were convicted of the killing , and anthony 's family , as devout christians , have since spoken publicly about their willingness to forgive .
anthony may be gone , but he certainly is not forgotten .
rather than feel bitterness for those who took anthony away from them , gee , 49 , and anthony 's sister dominique , 21 , are setting up a charity in his honour .
the anthony walker foundation aims to promote racial harmony among young people .
gee walker still lives in the quiet , leafy town on the outskirts of liverpool .
anthony lived at home with his mother when he was killed .
huyton is predominantly white with a mix of comfortable semi-detached and victorian houses as well as local authority estates . "
i 'm not condoning what they 've done " gee walker speaking about anthony 's niece , gee said : " i 've got a little baby in the house .
she was barely one when he -lrb- anthony -rrb- left and she still looks around for her uncle .
" so i know that children , you 've got to train them , and they understand more than we give them credit for .
" so if we start training them as young as possible hopefully we will educate them about people 's differences and encourage them to be tolerant .
we are hoping to go into schools to educate children and their parents alongside them .
" we 're working hard to get the anthony walker foundation off the ground , " gee said .
" it 's been a lot of hard work but they 're all working tirelessly behind the scenes .
" my hope is that people do n't forget this wonderful young man , my son anthony .
" you know when i chose to forgive , i 'm not condoning what they 've done , do n't get me wrong , they 've done something wrong , but we chose to forgive because we 're trying to live by the word of god . "
the foundation has already hosted a lecture with the national union of teachers on promoting racial harmony and there are plans to visit schools to talk to children about tolerating people 's differences .
gee and dominique are also setting up the annual anthony walker festival , which will be held at the greenbank sports academy & sefton park , liverpool , on the weekend of 12 august .
the festival seeks to promote community relations among young people in liverpool and nationwide .
organisers hope to hold a football and basketball tournament , showcase live music and host workshops on racial harmony .
since anthony 's murder , gee has said she has been pleasantly surprised at the community spirit in huyton .
" i had no idea there was so many good people around here , " she said .
" we 're busy .
i 've got a local vicar , he deals with the emotional side , i think emotions are still running high . "
she said the first anniversary of anthony 's murder on saturday would be a difficult day .
" if someone offered us a rocket to the moon i think we 'd be the first in the queue , as that day is not something we 're looking forward to , " she said .
" we 're running but i suppose it will catch up with us .
" i know it will be difficult , but as anthony said we can do all things to christ and we 're making those words into our lives , and we 're living by them now , because it 's our lifeline and we 're hanging onto those words to give us strength for that day . "
gee says she hopes to meet her son 's killers to try to understand what made them carry out the murder .
until then , the family will find hope through their faith .
