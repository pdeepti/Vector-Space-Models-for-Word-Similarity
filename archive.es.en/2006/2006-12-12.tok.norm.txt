" we have avoided a crisis over turkey " at the summit of eu leaders starting on thursday , beamed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , as they clinched the deal in defiance of all expectations . the talks had begun at around 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 gmt -rrb- and ran through a morning session , lunch and into the early evening , when the deep divisions over turkey 's candidacy were finally overcome , for now . " our view was that this should be settled today " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern . trade ties with cyprus key to the deal was a revision proposal from finland under which the european commission would constantly monitor turkey 's progress on normalizing trade ties with cyprus . the talks were " very complicated , " an eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 the greek cypriot government holding the southern two-thirds of cyprus is internationally recognized as having sovereignty over the whole of the island but does not control the northern third , where a turkish cypriot government is recognised only by ankara . cyprus and its ally greece , among those most angry at turkey 's refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , had demanded that a date be set at which the sanctions could be toughened if ankara makes no progress . in an effort to avoid further angering turkey , the ministers also discussed whether to include a note in written conclusions on their talks that the eu would work to bring an end to the isolation of northern cyprus . turkey has refused to normalize its trade ties with cyprus until the eu makes good on a promise from 2004 that it would help improve the livelihood of people in the turkish republic of northern cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ferryboat sets sail in the bosporus in istanbul the dispute is one of many to have plagued turkey 's eu membership talks since they began just over a year ago . no member state denies the geopolitical importance of encouraging reform in a mainly muslim but secular country led by a moderate islamic government which straddles europe , the middle east and the volatile caucasus region . " the decision we will take , or not take today , is very important - a strategic question - so now is not the time to rush things , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had said before the meeting . surprised turkey 's eu talks were always going to take at best a decade and membership is not assured , but the sudden shift to action has surprised turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül " i can not help wonder whether europe is really aware of the consequences of not sustaining the accession process at a time when a modern and prosperous turkey is becoming increasingly relevant to the well-being of the european union and beyond , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gül told the international herald tribune on monday . the biggest problem facing the ministers had been that questions of eu enlargement must , in almost all cases , be resolved with unanimous agreement . britain , estonia , italy , spain and sweden - turkey 's traditional allies - had only wanted three chapters frozen ; those most closely linked to its customs relations with the eu . austria and cyprus wanted more , while greece demanded that a strict timetable be established for monitoring turkey 's progress . " today is not just about turkey which is the subject of the debate , it 's also the eu 's credibility , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said before the meeting in brussels got underway . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .

" we have avoided a crisis over turkey " at the summit of eu leaders starting on thursday , beamed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , as they clinched the deal in defiance of all expectations . the talks had begun at around 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 gmt -rrb- and ran through a morning session , lunch and into the early evening , when the deep divisions over turkey 's candidacy were finally overcome , for now . " our view was that this should be settled today " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern . trade ties with cyprus key to the deal was a revision proposal from finland under which the european commission would constantly monitor turkey 's progress on normalizing trade ties with cyprus . the talks were " very complicated , " an eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 the greek cypriot government holding the southern two-thirds of cyprus is internationally recognized as having sovereignty over the whole of the island but does not control the northern third , where a turkish cypriot government is recognised only by ankara . cyprus and its ally greece , among those most angry at turkey 's refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , had demanded that a date be set at which the sanctions could be toughened if ankara makes no progress . in an effort to avoid further angering turkey , the ministers also discussed whether to include a note in written conclusions on their talks that the eu would work to bring an end to the isolation of northern cyprus . turkey has refused to normalize its trade ties with cyprus until the eu makes good on a promise from 2004 that it would help improve the livelihood of people in the turkish republic of northern cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ferryboat sets sail in the bosporus in istanbul the dispute is one of many to have plagued turkey 's eu membership talks since they began just over a year ago . no member state denies the geopolitical importance of encouraging reform in a mainly muslim but secular country led by a moderate islamic government which straddles europe , the middle east and the volatile caucasus region . " the decision we will take , or not take today , is very important - a strategic question - so now is not the time to rush things , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had said before the meeting . surprised turkey 's eu talks were always going to take at best a decade and membership is not assured , but the sudden shift to action has surprised turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül " i can not help wonder whether europe is really aware of the consequences of not sustaining the accession process at a time when a modern and prosperous turkey is becoming increasingly relevant to the well-being of the european union and beyond , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gül told the international herald tribune on monday . the biggest problem facing the ministers had been that questions of eu enlargement must , in almost all cases , be resolved with unanimous agreement . britain , estonia , italy , spain and sweden - turkey 's traditional allies - had only wanted three chapters frozen ; those most closely linked to its customs relations with the eu . austria and cyprus wanted more , while greece demanded that a strict timetable be established for monitoring turkey 's progress . " today is not just about turkey which is the subject of the debate , it 's also the eu 's credibility , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said before the meeting in brussels got underway . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .

" if you keep polonium in a tightly shut vial , you can transport it without contamination and do n't leave any dirty trail , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" either these killers were rank amateurs , or , and i think this is also plausible , a trail has been deliberately created to cast suspicion in a certain direction . " according to pflugbeil , there were far less obtrusive ways to kill someone than polonium poisoning - especially for espionage agencies , who have experience in killing defectors . all the way to moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian pflugbeil does not believe in the russian connection " what is remarkable here is the way it was done , " pflugbeil said .
" secret agents are normally trained to kill without leaving any evidence . " but in this case , it 's not just a trail , " added pflugbeil , a physicist who has previously studied how east german secret agents abused radioactive material .
" they have practically bulldozed a superhighway all the way to moscow .
they wanted to make a spectacle of it . " he said he knew of no case in which secret services had used polonium to kill an opponent . the hamburg connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kovtun spent two nights in his ex-wife 's apartment in hamburg the probe into the radioactive poisoning of former spy alexander litvinenko on monday homed in on two russians he met at a london hotel the day he fell ill , as relatives of one of them showed were believed to show signs of contamination . british detectives questioned a former kgb bodyguard , andrei lugovoi , in moscow , while police followed a trail of polonium 210 left in germany by his associate , dmitry kovtun . kovtun , who arrived in germany on oct .
28 on board an aeroflot flight from moscow , spent two nights at his ex-wife 's apartment in hamburg where she , her two children aged three and one , and her boyfriend came into contact with the radioactive substance . no danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry kovtun is a key figure in the poisoning investigation of alexander litvinenko kovtun 's family was , at first , believed to have been contaminated , but the german federal agency for radiation protection said on tuesday that this was not the case . " currently , our investigation tells us that we can definitely rule out any danger for the affected persons , " said gerald kirchner , the german official in charge of the case . " the level of contamination in the apartment corresponds roughly to the radiation that a smoker gets exposed to when he or she smokes several packs of cigarettes or strong cigars , " he added . hamburg prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against kovtun on charges of bringing a radioactive substance into the country and said they believe the russian businessman was " more a perpetrator than a victim . " he is believed to be suffering from radioactive poisoning in a moscow clinic but there have been conflicting reports about the state of his health . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes russian cooperation in litvinenko case germany has called for russia to increase its cooperation in the probe into the murder of alexander litvinenko after police found traces in hamburg of the radioactive substance used to kill the former russian spy .

in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .

those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference .

germany had contested the directive 's legal basis and wanted the partial annulment of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive bans tobacco companies from sponsoring events such as the formula one however , the luxembourg court rejected these arguments , saying that divergent national regulations on tobacco advertising impede the free movements of goods and the exchange of goods and services within the eu . in addition to banning tobacco advertising in print , radio and internet , the eu directive also bans tobacco sponsorship of cross-border cultural and sporting events . but advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising such as ash trays is still permitted , as is tobacco sponsorship at events which are purely local . tobacco advertising on television has been banned in the eu since the early 1990s . the rejection of germany 's challenge has only symbolic meaning , as the german lower house voted overwhelmingly in november in favor of the ban to bring germany in line with eu law .
the upper house still has to pass the law . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany dumps tobacco advertising to comply with eu the german parliament has voted to ban nearly all tobacco advertising to comply with european union mandates .
more anti-smoking legislation is on the horizon .

" we have avoided a crisis over turkey " at the summit of eu leaders starting on thursday , beamed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , as they clinched the deal in defiance of all expectations . the talks had begun at around 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 gmt -rrb- and ran through a morning session , lunch and into the early evening , when the deep divisions over turkey 's candidacy were finally overcome , for now . " our view was that this should be settled today " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern . trade ties with cyprus key to the deal was a revision proposal from finland under which the european commission would constantly monitor turkey 's progress on normalizing trade ties with cyprus . the talks were " very complicated , " an eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 the greek cypriot government holding the southern two-thirds of cyprus is internationally recognized as having sovereignty over the whole of the island but does not control the northern third , where a turkish cypriot government is recognised only by ankara . cyprus and its ally greece , among those most angry at turkey 's refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , had demanded that a date be set at which the sanctions could be toughened if ankara makes no progress . in an effort to avoid further angering turkey , the ministers also discussed whether to include a note in written conclusions on their talks that the eu would work to bring an end to the isolation of northern cyprus . turkey has refused to normalize its trade ties with cyprus until the eu makes good on a promise from 2004 that it would help improve the livelihood of people in the turkish republic of northern cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ferryboat sets sail in the bosporus in istanbul the dispute is one of many to have plagued turkey 's eu membership talks since they began just over a year ago . no member state denies the geopolitical importance of encouraging reform in a mainly muslim but secular country led by a moderate islamic government which straddles europe , the middle east and the volatile caucasus region . " the decision we will take , or not take today , is very important - a strategic question - so now is not the time to rush things , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had said before the meeting . surprised turkey 's eu talks were always going to take at best a decade and membership is not assured , but the sudden shift to action has surprised turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül " i can not help wonder whether europe is really aware of the consequences of not sustaining the accession process at a time when a modern and prosperous turkey is becoming increasingly relevant to the well-being of the european union and beyond , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gül told the international herald tribune on monday . the biggest problem facing the ministers had been that questions of eu enlargement must , in almost all cases , be resolved with unanimous agreement . britain , estonia , italy , spain and sweden - turkey 's traditional allies - had only wanted three chapters frozen ; those most closely linked to its customs relations with the eu . austria and cyprus wanted more , while greece demanded that a strict timetable be established for monitoring turkey 's progress . " today is not just about turkey which is the subject of the debate , it 's also the eu 's credibility , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said before the meeting in brussels got underway . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .
-lrb- 07.12.2006 -rrb- eu split over imposing tougher entry conditions on turkey european union leaders have divergent views on turkey 's troubled bid to join the 25-nation bloc , with germany and france set to call for tougher conditions on ankara .

"
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "
without the law suits which ensue , these people could not keep defining themselves anew and would be reduced to accepting what they actually are : sad lunatics . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad must be in a pretty poor position if he is forced to rally support from that league to further his political goals .
those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .
he is not interested in revealing historical truth , but rather , in exposing israel as an unjustified product of what he considers a genocide fallacy in order to strengthen his demands of abolishing israel . how grateful the president must have been that a handful of ultra-orthodox jews were present in the conference hall in tehran .
he did not notice , however , that it was precisely these participants who exposed the dismal strategy of the conference organizers .
they did not deny the holocaust , but they did stress that they reject israel as a nation .

he will not , however , abolish israel as he proceeds in this vein , and will not solve the israeli-palestinian conflict .
and only scatterbrains among palestinians and others in the arab world will consider ahmadinejad a hero .

"
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "
without the law suits which ensue , these people could not keep defining themselves anew and would be reduced to accepting what they actually are : sad lunatics . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad must be in a pretty poor position if he is forced to rally support from that league to further his political goals .
those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .
he is not interested in revealing historical truth , but rather , in exposing israel as an unjustified product of what he considers a genocide fallacy in order to strengthen his demands of abolishing israel . how grateful the president must have been that a handful of ultra-orthodox jews were present in the conference hall in tehran .
he did not notice , however , that it was precisely these participants who exposed the dismal strategy of the conference organizers .
they did not deny the holocaust , but they did stress that they reject israel as a nation .
orthodox jews believe that the jewish state may only evolve following the coming of the messiah . contrary to his portrayals of himself : mahmoud ahmadinejad is no messiah .
his agenda is damaging to iran , he forces level-headed iranians into desperation and he intimates people abroad who speak up for the legitimate interests of iran .
he will not , however , abolish israel as he proceeds in this vein , and will not solve the israeli-palestinian conflict .
and only scatterbrains among palestinians and others in the arab world will consider ahmadinejad a hero .
most of these people have long been realistic enough to accept facts - such as israel and the holocaust - and to demand a historical compromise for the palestinian people so that palestinians and jews can finally live in peace and harmony . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- als -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference .

" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii .

and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .

" if you keep polonium in a tightly shut vial , you can transport it without contamination and do n't leave any dirty trail , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" either these killers were rank amateurs , or , and i think this is also plausible , a trail has been deliberately created to cast suspicion in a certain direction . " according to pflugbeil , there were far less obtrusive ways to kill someone than polonium poisoning - especially for espionage agencies , who have experience in killing defectors . all the way to moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian pflugbeil does not believe in the russian connection " what is remarkable here is the way it was done , " pflugbeil said .
" secret agents are normally trained to kill without leaving any evidence . " but in this case , it 's not just a trail , " added pflugbeil , a physicist who has previously studied how east german secret agents abused radioactive material .
" they have practically bulldozed a superhighway all the way to moscow .
they wanted to make a spectacle of it . " he said he knew of no case in which secret services had used polonium to kill an opponent . the hamburg connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kovtun spent two nights in his ex-wife 's apartment in hamburg the probe into the radioactive poisoning of former spy alexander litvinenko on monday homed in on two russians he met at a london hotel the day he fell ill , as relatives of one of them showed were believed to show signs of contamination . british detectives questioned a former kgb bodyguard , andrei lugovoi , in moscow , while police followed a trail of polonium 210 left in germany by his associate , dmitry kovtun . kovtun , who arrived in germany on oct .
28 on board an aeroflot flight from moscow , spent two nights at his ex-wife 's apartment in hamburg where she , her two children aged three and one , and her boyfriend came into contact with the radioactive substance . no danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry kovtun is a key figure in the poisoning investigation of alexander litvinenko kovtun 's family was , at first , believed to have been contaminated , but the german federal agency for radiation protection said on tuesday that this was not the case . " currently , our investigation tells us that we can definitely rule out any danger for the affected persons , " said gerald kirchner , the german official in charge of the case . " the level of contamination in the apartment corresponds roughly to the radiation that a smoker gets exposed to when he or she smokes several packs of cigarettes or strong cigars , " he added . hamburg prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against kovtun on charges of bringing a radioactive substance into the country and said they believe the russian businessman was " more a perpetrator than a victim . " he is believed to be suffering from radioactive poisoning in a moscow clinic but there have been conflicting reports about the state of his health . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes russian cooperation in litvinenko case germany has called for russia to increase its cooperation in the probe into the murder of alexander litvinenko after police found traces in hamburg of the radioactive substance used to kill the former russian spy .

1 . according to grömling , the postive outlook for 2007 has more to with germany 's strong exports sector rather than domestic reforms .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference . " i do n't think a dialogue is possible with people who deny the holocaust , " hilberg said . between history and politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before it opened , the teheran conference was condemned by germany , the us and israel .
bpb president thomas krüger said the berlin conference was designed to respond to the " absurd arguments " of iranian president ahmadinejad , who has questioned the existence of the holocaust and said israel should be wiped off the map . " doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .
he said he feels that given the rapid progress in holocaust research , there should be more opportunities for the public and the scientific community to debate the latest findings . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

"
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "
without the law suits which ensue , these people could not keep defining themselves anew and would be reduced to accepting what they actually are : sad lunatics . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad must be in a pretty poor position if he is forced to rally support from that league to further his political goals .
those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .
he is not interested in revealing historical truth , but rather , in exposing israel as an unjustified product of what he considers a genocide fallacy in order to strengthen his demands of abolishing israel . how grateful the president must have been that a handful of ultra-orthodox jews were present in the conference hall in tehran .
he did not notice , however , that it was precisely these participants who exposed the dismal strategy of the conference organizers .
they did not deny the holocaust , but they did stress that they reject israel as a nation .
orthodox jews believe that the jewish state may only evolve following the coming of the messiah . contrary to his portrayals of himself : mahmoud ahmadinejad is no messiah .
his agenda is damaging to iran , he forces level-headed iranians into desperation and he intimates people abroad who speak up for the legitimate interests of iran .
he will not , however , abolish israel as he proceeds in this vein , and will not solve the israeli-palestinian conflict .
and only scatterbrains among palestinians and others in the arab world will consider ahmadinejad a hero .
most of these people have long been realistic enough to accept facts - such as israel and the holocaust - and to demand a historical compromise for the palestinian people so that palestinians and jews can finally live in peace and harmony . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- als -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

" if you keep polonium in a tightly shut vial , you can transport it without contamination and do n't leave any dirty trail , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" either these killers were rank amateurs , or , and i think this is also plausible , a trail has been deliberately created to cast suspicion in a certain direction . " according to pflugbeil , there were far less obtrusive ways to kill someone than polonium poisoning - especially for espionage agencies , who have experience in killing defectors . all the way to moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian pflugbeil does not believe in the russian connection " what is remarkable here is the way it was done , " pflugbeil said .
" secret agents are normally trained to kill without leaving any evidence . " but in this case , it 's not just a trail , " added pflugbeil , a physicist who has previously studied how east german secret agents abused radioactive material .
" they have practically bulldozed a superhighway all the way to moscow .
they wanted to make a spectacle of it . " he said he knew of no case in which secret services had used polonium to kill an opponent . the hamburg connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kovtun spent two nights in his ex-wife 's apartment in hamburg the probe into the radioactive poisoning of former spy alexander litvinenko on monday homed in on two russians he met at a london hotel the day he fell ill , as relatives of one of them showed were believed to show signs of contamination . british detectives questioned a former kgb bodyguard , andrei lugovoi , in moscow , while police followed a trail of polonium 210 left in germany by his associate , dmitry kovtun . kovtun , who arrived in germany on oct .
28 on board an aeroflot flight from moscow , spent two nights at his ex-wife 's apartment in hamburg where she , her two children aged three and one , and her boyfriend came into contact with the radioactive substance . no danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry kovtun is a key figure in the poisoning investigation of alexander litvinenko kovtun 's family was , at first , believed to have been contaminated , but the german federal agency for radiation protection said on tuesday that this was not the case . " currently , our investigation tells us that we can definitely rule out any danger for the affected persons , " said gerald kirchner , the german official in charge of the case . " the level of contamination in the apartment corresponds roughly to the radiation that a smoker gets exposed to when he or she smokes several packs of cigarettes or strong cigars , " he added . hamburg prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against kovtun on charges of bringing a radioactive substance into the country and said they believe the russian businessman was " more a perpetrator than a victim . " he is believed to be suffering from radioactive poisoning in a moscow clinic but there have been conflicting reports about the state of his health . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes russian cooperation in litvinenko case germany has called for russia to increase its cooperation in the probe into the murder of alexander litvinenko after police found traces in hamburg of the radioactive substance used to kill the former russian spy .

" we have avoided a crisis over turkey " at the summit of eu leaders starting on thursday , beamed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , as they clinched the deal in defiance of all expectations . the talks had begun at around 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 gmt -rrb- and ran through a morning session , lunch and into the early evening , when the deep divisions over turkey 's candidacy were finally overcome , for now . " our view was that this should be settled today " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern . trade ties with cyprus key to the deal was a revision proposal from finland under which the european commission would constantly monitor turkey 's progress on normalizing trade ties with cyprus . the talks were " very complicated , " an eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 the greek cypriot government holding the southern two-thirds of cyprus is internationally recognized as having sovereignty over the whole of the island but does not control the northern third , where a turkish cypriot government is recognised only by ankara . cyprus and its ally greece , among those most angry at turkey 's refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , had demanded that a date be set at which the sanctions could be toughened if ankara makes no progress . in an effort to avoid further angering turkey , the ministers also discussed whether to include a note in written conclusions on their talks that the eu would work to bring an end to the isolation of northern cyprus . turkey has refused to normalize its trade ties with cyprus until the eu makes good on a promise from 2004 that it would help improve the livelihood of people in the turkish republic of northern cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ferryboat sets sail in the bosporus in istanbul the dispute is one of many to have plagued turkey 's eu membership talks since they began just over a year ago . no member state denies the geopolitical importance of encouraging reform in a mainly muslim but secular country led by a moderate islamic government which straddles europe , the middle east and the volatile caucasus region . " the decision we will take , or not take today , is very important - a strategic question - so now is not the time to rush things , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had said before the meeting . surprised turkey 's eu talks were always going to take at best a decade and membership is not assured , but the sudden shift to action has surprised turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül " i can not help wonder whether europe is really aware of the consequences of not sustaining the accession process at a time when a modern and prosperous turkey is becoming increasingly relevant to the well-being of the european union and beyond , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gül told the international herald tribune on monday . the biggest problem facing the ministers had been that questions of eu enlargement must , in almost all cases , be resolved with unanimous agreement . britain , estonia , italy , spain and sweden - turkey 's traditional allies - had only wanted three chapters frozen ; those most closely linked to its customs relations with the eu . austria and cyprus wanted more , while greece demanded that a strict timetable be established for monitoring turkey 's progress . " today is not just about turkey which is the subject of the debate , it 's also the eu 's credibility , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said before the meeting in brussels got underway . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference .

" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii .

" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .

and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .

" doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .
he said he feels that given the rapid progress in holocaust research , there should be more opportunities for the public and the scientific community to debate the latest findings . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

in its business cycle forecast released on tuesday , ifw said there were " good chances of a long lasting upswing and significant reduction in unemployment . " ifw expects a considerable expansion of aggregate production triggered by a rise in net exports .
the forecast points to increased employment as an indicator of business confidence in europe 's biggest economy . " obviously , firms expected a continuous rise in aggregate demand , otherwise they would not invest in capital goods and personnel , " the survey found . business confidence up the zew index compiled by the mannheim-based centre for european economic research climbed 9.5 points to minus 19 after a 1.1 point drop in november and a bigger 5.2 point decline in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booming german exports are feeding the rise in business confidence the investor index , which surveys more than 300 financial experts about their confidence in germany 's economy six months down the track , rose to its highest level this year , but was still well below its historical average of 33.7 . after 10 months of consecutive declines , " expectations have passed through the trough and are now on the rise , thanks to robust economic perspectives , " zew president wolfgang franz said in a statement released on tuesday . outlook rosy the zew index corresponds with the newest business confidence survey conducted by the german economy institute in cologne , which found that economic expectations for 2007 were at the highest levels since the study began in 2002 . michael grömling , the head of the macroeconomic unit at the cologne institute , said the bounce in german business confidence was across the board in areas of production , exports , investment , earnings and job creation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction firms are the most optimistic about their economic prospects in 2007 " the healthy global economy is driving the recovery in germany , " grömling said .
" as a result , german firms are quite optimistic about their global position and they are widening their capacities . " the study found that business confidence for 2007 was slightly lower in the east of germany where 40 percent of those surveyed were optimistic compared to 58 percent in the west . across the country , the building sector showed the most significant rise in confidence , with 63 percent expecting better conditions in 2007 . the improved economic optimism comes despite the three-percent increase in germany 's value-added tax from 16 to 19 percent to be introduced on jan .
1 . according to grömling , the postive outlook for 2007 has more to with germany 's strong exports sector rather than domestic reforms . " the recent tax reform has brought some benefits , but only small progress has been made on other government reforms such as the overhaul of the labor system .

" we have avoided a crisis over turkey " at the summit of eu leaders starting on thursday , beamed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , as they clinched the deal in defiance of all expectations . the talks had begun at around 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 gmt -rrb- and ran through a morning session , lunch and into the early evening , when the deep divisions over turkey 's candidacy were finally overcome , for now . " our view was that this should be settled today " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern . trade ties with cyprus key to the deal was a revision proposal from finland under which the european commission would constantly monitor turkey 's progress on normalizing trade ties with cyprus . the talks were " very complicated , " an eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 the greek cypriot government holding the southern two-thirds of cyprus is internationally recognized as having sovereignty over the whole of the island but does not control the northern third , where a turkish cypriot government is recognised only by ankara . cyprus and its ally greece , among those most angry at turkey 's refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , had demanded that a date be set at which the sanctions could be toughened if ankara makes no progress . in an effort to avoid further angering turkey , the ministers also discussed whether to include a note in written conclusions on their talks that the eu would work to bring an end to the isolation of northern cyprus . turkey has refused to normalize its trade ties with cyprus until the eu makes good on a promise from 2004 that it would help improve the livelihood of people in the turkish republic of northern cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ferryboat sets sail in the bosporus in istanbul the dispute is one of many to have plagued turkey 's eu membership talks since they began just over a year ago . no member state denies the geopolitical importance of encouraging reform in a mainly muslim but secular country led by a moderate islamic government which straddles europe , the middle east and the volatile caucasus region . " the decision we will take , or not take today , is very important - a strategic question - so now is not the time to rush things , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had said before the meeting . surprised turkey 's eu talks were always going to take at best a decade and membership is not assured , but the sudden shift to action has surprised turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül " i can not help wonder whether europe is really aware of the consequences of not sustaining the accession process at a time when a modern and prosperous turkey is becoming increasingly relevant to the well-being of the european union and beyond , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gül told the international herald tribune on monday . the biggest problem facing the ministers had been that questions of eu enlargement must , in almost all cases , be resolved with unanimous agreement . britain , estonia , italy , spain and sweden - turkey 's traditional allies - had only wanted three chapters frozen ; those most closely linked to its customs relations with the eu . austria and cyprus wanted more , while greece demanded that a strict timetable be established for monitoring turkey 's progress . " today is not just about turkey which is the subject of the debate , it 's also the eu 's credibility , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said before the meeting in brussels got underway . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .

" we have avoided a crisis over turkey " at the summit of eu leaders starting on thursday , beamed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , as they clinched the deal in defiance of all expectations . the talks had begun at around 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 gmt -rrb- and ran through a morning session , lunch and into the early evening , when the deep divisions over turkey 's candidacy were finally overcome , for now . " our view was that this should be settled today " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern . trade ties with cyprus key to the deal was a revision proposal from finland under which the european commission would constantly monitor turkey 's progress on normalizing trade ties with cyprus . the talks were " very complicated , " an eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 the greek cypriot government holding the southern two-thirds of cyprus is internationally recognized as having sovereignty over the whole of the island but does not control the northern third , where a turkish cypriot government is recognised only by ankara . cyprus and its ally greece , among those most angry at turkey 's refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , had demanded that a date be set at which the sanctions could be toughened if ankara makes no progress . in an effort to avoid further angering turkey , the ministers also discussed whether to include a note in written conclusions on their talks that the eu would work to bring an end to the isolation of northern cyprus . turkey has refused to normalize its trade ties with cyprus until the eu makes good on a promise from 2004 that it would help improve the livelihood of people in the turkish republic of northern cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ferryboat sets sail in the bosporus in istanbul the dispute is one of many to have plagued turkey 's eu membership talks since they began just over a year ago . no member state denies the geopolitical importance of encouraging reform in a mainly muslim but secular country led by a moderate islamic government which straddles europe , the middle east and the volatile caucasus region . " the decision we will take , or not take today , is very important - a strategic question - so now is not the time to rush things , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had said before the meeting . surprised turkey 's eu talks were always going to take at best a decade and membership is not assured , but the sudden shift to action has surprised turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül " i can not help wonder whether europe is really aware of the consequences of not sustaining the accession process at a time when a modern and prosperous turkey is becoming increasingly relevant to the well-being of the european union and beyond , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gül told the international herald tribune on monday . the biggest problem facing the ministers had been that questions of eu enlargement must , in almost all cases , be resolved with unanimous agreement . britain , estonia , italy , spain and sweden - turkey 's traditional allies - had only wanted three chapters frozen ; those most closely linked to its customs relations with the eu . austria and cyprus wanted more , while greece demanded that a strict timetable be established for monitoring turkey 's progress . " today is not just about turkey which is the subject of the debate , it 's also the eu 's credibility , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said before the meeting in brussels got underway . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .

germany had contested the directive 's legal basis and wanted the partial annulment of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive bans tobacco companies from sponsoring events such as the formula one however , the luxembourg court rejected these arguments , saying that divergent national regulations on tobacco advertising impede the free movements of goods and the exchange of goods and services within the eu . in addition to banning tobacco advertising in print , radio and internet , the eu directive also bans tobacco sponsorship of cross-border cultural and sporting events . but advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising such as ash trays is still permitted , as is tobacco sponsorship at events which are purely local . tobacco advertising on television has been banned in the eu since the early 1990s . the rejection of germany 's challenge has only symbolic meaning , as the german lower house voted overwhelmingly in november in favor of the ban to bring germany in line with eu law .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference . " i do n't think a dialogue is possible with people who deny the holocaust , " hilberg said . between history and politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before it opened , the teheran conference was condemned by germany , the us and israel .
bpb president thomas krüger said the berlin conference was designed to respond to the " absurd arguments " of iranian president ahmadinejad , who has questioned the existence of the holocaust and said israel should be wiped off the map . " doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference . " i do n't think a dialogue is possible with people who deny the holocaust , " hilberg said . between history and politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before it opened , the teheran conference was condemned by germany , the us and israel .
bpb president thomas krüger said the berlin conference was designed to respond to the " absurd arguments " of iranian president ahmadinejad , who has questioned the existence of the holocaust and said israel should be wiped off the map . " doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .
he said he feels that given the rapid progress in holocaust research , there should be more opportunities for the public and the scientific community to debate the latest findings . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

"
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "
without the law suits which ensue , these people could not keep defining themselves anew and would be reduced to accepting what they actually are : sad lunatics . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad must be in a pretty poor position if he is forced to rally support from that league to further his political goals .
those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .
he is not interested in revealing historical truth , but rather , in exposing israel as an unjustified product of what he considers a genocide fallacy in order to strengthen his demands of abolishing israel . how grateful the president must have been that a handful of ultra-orthodox jews were present in the conference hall in tehran .
he did not notice , however , that it was precisely these participants who exposed the dismal strategy of the conference organizers .
they did not deny the holocaust , but they did stress that they reject israel as a nation .
orthodox jews believe that the jewish state may only evolve following the coming of the messiah . contrary to his portrayals of himself : mahmoud ahmadinejad is no messiah .
his agenda is damaging to iran , he forces level-headed iranians into desperation and he intimates people abroad who speak up for the legitimate interests of iran .
he will not , however , abolish israel as he proceeds in this vein , and will not solve the israeli-palestinian conflict .
and only scatterbrains among palestinians and others in the arab world will consider ahmadinejad a hero .

"
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "
without the law suits which ensue , these people could not keep defining themselves anew and would be reduced to accepting what they actually are : sad lunatics . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad must be in a pretty poor position if he is forced to rally support from that league to further his political goals .
those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .
he is not interested in revealing historical truth , but rather , in exposing israel as an unjustified product of what he considers a genocide fallacy in order to strengthen his demands of abolishing israel . how grateful the president must have been that a handful of ultra-orthodox jews were present in the conference hall in tehran .
he did not notice , however , that it was precisely these participants who exposed the dismal strategy of the conference organizers .
they did not deny the holocaust , but they did stress that they reject israel as a nation .
orthodox jews believe that the jewish state may only evolve following the coming of the messiah . contrary to his portrayals of himself : mahmoud ahmadinejad is no messiah .
his agenda is damaging to iran , he forces level-headed iranians into desperation and he intimates people abroad who speak up for the legitimate interests of iran .
he will not , however , abolish israel as he proceeds in this vein , and will not solve the israeli-palestinian conflict .
and only scatterbrains among palestinians and others in the arab world will consider ahmadinejad a hero .
most of these people have long been realistic enough to accept facts - such as israel and the holocaust - and to demand a historical compromise for the palestinian people so that palestinians and jews can finally live in peace and harmony . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- als -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

germany had contested the directive 's legal basis and wanted the partial annulment of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive bans tobacco companies from sponsoring events such as the formula one however , the luxembourg court rejected these arguments , saying that divergent national regulations on tobacco advertising impede the free movements of goods and the exchange of goods and services within the eu . in addition to banning tobacco advertising in print , radio and internet , the eu directive also bans tobacco sponsorship of cross-border cultural and sporting events . but advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising such as ash trays is still permitted , as is tobacco sponsorship at events which are purely local . tobacco advertising on television has been banned in the eu since the early 1990s . the rejection of germany 's challenge has only symbolic meaning , as the german lower house voted overwhelmingly in november in favor of the ban to bring germany in line with eu law .
the upper house still has to pass the law . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany dumps tobacco advertising to comply with eu the german parliament has voted to ban nearly all tobacco advertising to comply with european union mandates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.12.2006 opinion : ahmadinejad is not a hero for level-headed people großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " holocaust conference " in tehran was less a meeting of minds and more of a " traveling circus " of holocaust deniers , says dw 's peter philipp . in the past few days , iranian authorities have once again launched an attack on the internet , blocking access to sites critical of the regime , those discussing movies and books and even to the free encyclopedia " wikipedia . "
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "
without the law suits which ensue , these people could not keep defining themselves anew and would be reduced to accepting what they actually are : sad lunatics . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad must be in a pretty poor position if he is forced to rally support from that league to further his political goals .
those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .
he is not interested in revealing historical truth , but rather , in exposing israel as an unjustified product of what he considers a genocide fallacy in order to strengthen his demands of abolishing israel . how grateful the president must have been that a handful of ultra-orthodox jews were present in the conference hall in tehran .
he did not notice , however , that it was precisely these participants who exposed the dismal strategy of the conference organizers .
they did not deny the holocaust , but they did stress that they reject israel as a nation .
orthodox jews believe that the jewish state may only evolve following the coming of the messiah . contrary to his portrayals of himself : mahmoud ahmadinejad is no messiah .
his agenda is damaging to iran , he forces level-headed iranians into desperation and he intimates people abroad who speak up for the legitimate interests of iran .

"
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "
without the law suits which ensue , these people could not keep defining themselves anew and would be reduced to accepting what they actually are : sad lunatics . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad must be in a pretty poor position if he is forced to rally support from that league to further his political goals .
those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .
he is not interested in revealing historical truth , but rather , in exposing israel as an unjustified product of what he considers a genocide fallacy in order to strengthen his demands of abolishing israel . how grateful the president must have been that a handful of ultra-orthodox jews were present in the conference hall in tehran .
he did not notice , however , that it was precisely these participants who exposed the dismal strategy of the conference organizers .
they did not deny the holocaust , but they did stress that they reject israel as a nation .
orthodox jews believe that the jewish state may only evolve following the coming of the messiah . contrary to his portrayals of himself : mahmoud ahmadinejad is no messiah .
his agenda is damaging to iran , he forces level-headed iranians into desperation and he intimates people abroad who speak up for the legitimate interests of iran .
he will not , however , abolish israel as he proceeds in this vein , and will not solve the israeli-palestinian conflict .
and only scatterbrains among palestinians and others in the arab world will consider ahmadinejad a hero .
most of these people have long been realistic enough to accept facts - such as israel and the holocaust - and to demand a historical compromise for the palestinian people so that palestinians and jews can finally live in peace and harmony . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- als -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

germany had contested the directive 's legal basis and wanted the partial annulment of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive bans tobacco companies from sponsoring events such as the formula one however , the luxembourg court rejected these arguments , saying that divergent national regulations on tobacco advertising impede the free movements of goods and the exchange of goods and services within the eu . in addition to banning tobacco advertising in print , radio and internet , the eu directive also bans tobacco sponsorship of cross-border cultural and sporting events . but advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising such as ash trays is still permitted , as is tobacco sponsorship at events which are purely local . tobacco advertising on television has been banned in the eu since the early 1990s . the rejection of germany 's challenge has only symbolic meaning , as the german lower house voted overwhelmingly in november in favor of the ban to bring germany in line with eu law .
the upper house still has to pass the law . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany dumps tobacco advertising to comply with eu the german parliament has voted to ban nearly all tobacco advertising to comply with european union mandates .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference . " i do n't think a dialogue is possible with people who deny the holocaust , " hilberg said . between history and politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before it opened , the teheran conference was condemned by germany , the us and israel .
bpb president thomas krüger said the berlin conference was designed to respond to the " absurd arguments " of iranian president ahmadinejad , who has questioned the existence of the holocaust and said israel should be wiped off the map . " doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .
he said he feels that given the rapid progress in holocaust research , there should be more opportunities for the public and the scientific community to debate the latest findings . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

germany had contested the directive 's legal basis and wanted the partial annulment of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive bans tobacco companies from sponsoring events such as the formula one however , the luxembourg court rejected these arguments , saying that divergent national regulations on tobacco advertising impede the free movements of goods and the exchange of goods and services within the eu . in addition to banning tobacco advertising in print , radio and internet , the eu directive also bans tobacco sponsorship of cross-border cultural and sporting events . but advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising such as ash trays is still permitted , as is tobacco sponsorship at events which are purely local . tobacco advertising on television has been banned in the eu since the early 1990s . the rejection of germany 's challenge has only symbolic meaning , as the german lower house voted overwhelmingly in november in favor of the ban to bring germany in line with eu law .
the upper house still has to pass the law . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany dumps tobacco advertising to comply with eu the german parliament has voted to ban nearly all tobacco advertising to comply with european union mandates .

" we have avoided a crisis over turkey " at the summit of eu leaders starting on thursday , beamed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , as they clinched the deal in defiance of all expectations . the talks had begun at around 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 gmt -rrb- and ran through a morning session , lunch and into the early evening , when the deep divisions over turkey 's candidacy were finally overcome , for now . " our view was that this should be settled today " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern . trade ties with cyprus key to the deal was a revision proposal from finland under which the european commission would constantly monitor turkey 's progress on normalizing trade ties with cyprus . the talks were " very complicated , " an eu official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 the greek cypriot government holding the southern two-thirds of cyprus is internationally recognized as having sovereignty over the whole of the island but does not control the northern third , where a turkish cypriot government is recognised only by ankara . cyprus and its ally greece , among those most angry at turkey 's refusal to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot craft , had demanded that a date be set at which the sanctions could be toughened if ankara makes no progress . in an effort to avoid further angering turkey , the ministers also discussed whether to include a note in written conclusions on their talks that the eu would work to bring an end to the isolation of northern cyprus . turkey has refused to normalize its trade ties with cyprus until the eu makes good on a promise from 2004 that it would help improve the livelihood of people in the turkish republic of northern cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ferryboat sets sail in the bosporus in istanbul the dispute is one of many to have plagued turkey 's eu membership talks since they began just over a year ago . no member state denies the geopolitical importance of encouraging reform in a mainly muslim but secular country led by a moderate islamic government which straddles europe , the middle east and the volatile caucasus region . " the decision we will take , or not take today , is very important - a strategic question - so now is not the time to rush things , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos had said before the meeting . surprised turkey 's eu talks were always going to take at best a decade and membership is not assured , but the sudden shift to action has surprised turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül " i can not help wonder whether europe is really aware of the consequences of not sustaining the accession process at a time when a modern and prosperous turkey is becoming increasingly relevant to the well-being of the european union and beyond , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gül told the international herald tribune on monday . the biggest problem facing the ministers had been that questions of eu enlargement must , in almost all cases , be resolved with unanimous agreement . britain , estonia , italy , spain and sweden - turkey 's traditional allies - had only wanted three chapters frozen ; those most closely linked to its customs relations with the eu . austria and cyprus wanted more , while greece demanded that a strict timetable be established for monitoring turkey 's progress . " today is not just about turkey which is the subject of the debate , it 's also the eu 's credibility , " luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said before the meeting in brussels got underway . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey " cautiously prepared " to open harbor , airport to cyprus turkey , faced with partial suspension of its european union membership talks , has signaled its willingness to open a port and an airport to greek cypriot craft , a spokesman for finland 's eu presidency said thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 12.12.2006 historians debate holocaust research in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust research has benefited from the opening of eastern european archives leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .
the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference . " i do n't think a dialogue is possible with people who deny the holocaust , " hilberg said . between history and politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before it opened , the teheran conference was condemned by germany , the us and israel .
bpb president thomas krüger said the berlin conference was designed to respond to the " absurd arguments " of iranian president ahmadinejad , who has questioned the existence of the holocaust and said israel should be wiped off the map . " doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .
he said he feels that given the rapid progress in holocaust research , there should be more opportunities for the public and the scientific community to debate the latest findings . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

" if you keep polonium in a tightly shut vial , you can transport it without contamination and do n't leave any dirty trail , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" either these killers were rank amateurs , or , and i think this is also plausible , a trail has been deliberately created to cast suspicion in a certain direction . " according to pflugbeil , there were far less obtrusive ways to kill someone than polonium poisoning - especially for espionage agencies , who have experience in killing defectors . all the way to moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian pflugbeil does not believe in the russian connection " what is remarkable here is the way it was done , " pflugbeil said .
" secret agents are normally trained to kill without leaving any evidence . " but in this case , it 's not just a trail , " added pflugbeil , a physicist who has previously studied how east german secret agents abused radioactive material .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 12.12.2006 historians debate holocaust research in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holocaust research has benefited from the opening of eastern european archives leading holocaust historians gathered in berlin to discuss the current state of holocaust studies .
the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference . " i do n't think a dialogue is possible with people who deny the holocaust , " hilberg said . between history and politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before it opened , the teheran conference was condemned by germany , the us and israel .
bpb president thomas krüger said the berlin conference was designed to respond to the " absurd arguments " of iranian president ahmadinejad , who has questioned the existence of the holocaust and said israel should be wiped off the map . " doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .
he said he feels that given the rapid progress in holocaust research , there should be more opportunities for the public and the scientific community to debate the latest findings . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference . " i do n't think a dialogue is possible with people who deny the holocaust , " hilberg said . between history and politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before it opened , the teheran conference was condemned by germany , the us and israel .
bpb president thomas krüger said the berlin conference was designed to respond to the " absurd arguments " of iranian president ahmadinejad , who has questioned the existence of the holocaust and said israel should be wiped off the map . " doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .
he said he feels that given the rapid progress in holocaust research , there should be more opportunities for the public and the scientific community to debate the latest findings . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .

"
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "

he will not , however , abolish israel as he proceeds in this vein , and will not solve the israeli-palestinian conflict .

germany had contested the directive 's legal basis and wanted the partial annulment of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive bans tobacco companies from sponsoring events such as the formula one however , the luxembourg court rejected these arguments , saying that divergent national regulations on tobacco advertising impede the free movements of goods and the exchange of goods and services within the eu . in addition to banning tobacco advertising in print , radio and internet , the eu directive also bans tobacco sponsorship of cross-border cultural and sporting events . but advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising such as ash trays is still permitted , as is tobacco sponsorship at events which are purely local . tobacco advertising on television has been banned in the eu since the early 1990s . the rejection of germany 's challenge has only symbolic meaning , as the german lower house voted overwhelmingly in november in favor of the ban to bring germany in line with eu law .

germany had contested the directive 's legal basis and wanted the partial annulment of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive bans tobacco companies from sponsoring events such as the formula one however , the luxembourg court rejected these arguments , saying that divergent national regulations on tobacco advertising impede the free movements of goods and the exchange of goods and services within the eu . in addition to banning tobacco advertising in print , radio and internet , the eu directive also bans tobacco sponsorship of cross-border cultural and sporting events . but advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising such as ash trays is still permitted , as is tobacco sponsorship at events which are purely local . tobacco advertising on television has been banned in the eu since the early 1990s . the rejection of germany 's challenge has only symbolic meaning , as the german lower house voted overwhelmingly in november in favor of the ban to bring germany in line with eu law .
the upper house still has to pass the law . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany dumps tobacco advertising to comply with eu the german parliament has voted to ban nearly all tobacco advertising to comply with european union mandates .

" if you keep polonium in a tightly shut vial , you can transport it without contamination and do n't leave any dirty trail , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
" either these killers were rank amateurs , or , and i think this is also plausible , a trail has been deliberately created to cast suspicion in a certain direction . " according to pflugbeil , there were far less obtrusive ways to kill someone than polonium poisoning - especially for espionage agencies , who have experience in killing defectors . all the way to moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian pflugbeil does not believe in the russian connection " what is remarkable here is the way it was done , " pflugbeil said .
" secret agents are normally trained to kill without leaving any evidence . " but in this case , it 's not just a trail , " added pflugbeil , a physicist who has previously studied how east german secret agents abused radioactive material .
" they have practically bulldozed a superhighway all the way to moscow .
they wanted to make a spectacle of it . " he said he knew of no case in which secret services had used polonium to kill an opponent . the hamburg connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kovtun spent two nights in his ex-wife 's apartment in hamburg the probe into the radioactive poisoning of former spy alexander litvinenko on monday homed in on two russians he met at a london hotel the day he fell ill , as relatives of one of them showed were believed to show signs of contamination . british detectives questioned a former kgb bodyguard , andrei lugovoi , in moscow , while police followed a trail of polonium 210 left in germany by his associate , dmitry kovtun . kovtun , who arrived in germany on oct .
28 on board an aeroflot flight from moscow , spent two nights at his ex-wife 's apartment in hamburg where she , her two children aged three and one , and her boyfriend came into contact with the radioactive substance . no danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dmitry kovtun is a key figure in the poisoning investigation of alexander litvinenko kovtun 's family was , at first , believed to have been contaminated , but the german federal agency for radiation protection said on tuesday that this was not the case . " currently , our investigation tells us that we can definitely rule out any danger for the affected persons , " said gerald kirchner , the german official in charge of the case . " the level of contamination in the apartment corresponds roughly to the radiation that a smoker gets exposed to when he or she smokes several packs of cigarettes or strong cigars , " he added . hamburg prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against kovtun on charges of bringing a radioactive substance into the country and said they believe the russian businessman was " more a perpetrator than a victim . " he is believed to be suffering from radioactive poisoning in a moscow clinic but there have been conflicting reports about the state of his health . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes russian cooperation in litvinenko case germany has called for russia to increase its cooperation in the probe into the murder of alexander litvinenko after police found traces in hamburg of the radioactive substance used to kill the former russian spy .

in its business cycle forecast released on tuesday , ifw said there were " good chances of a long lasting upswing and significant reduction in unemployment . " ifw expects a considerable expansion of aggregate production triggered by a rise in net exports .
the forecast points to increased employment as an indicator of business confidence in europe 's biggest economy . " obviously , firms expected a continuous rise in aggregate demand , otherwise they would not invest in capital goods and personnel , " the survey found . business confidence up the zew index compiled by the mannheim-based centre for european economic research climbed 9.5 points to minus 19 after a 1.1 point drop in november and a bigger 5.2 point decline in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booming german exports are feeding the rise in business confidence the investor index , which surveys more than 300 financial experts about their confidence in germany 's economy six months down the track , rose to its highest level this year , but was still well below its historical average of 33.7 . after 10 months of consecutive declines , " expectations have passed through the trough and are now on the rise , thanks to robust economic perspectives , " zew president wolfgang franz said in a statement released on tuesday . outlook rosy the zew index corresponds with the newest business confidence survey conducted by the german economy institute in cologne , which found that economic expectations for 2007 were at the highest levels since the study began in 2002 . michael grömling , the head of the macroeconomic unit at the cologne institute , said the bounce in german business confidence was across the board in areas of production , exports , investment , earnings and job creation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction firms are the most optimistic about their economic prospects in 2007 " the healthy global economy is driving the recovery in germany , " grömling said .
" as a result , german firms are quite optimistic about their global position and they are widening their capacities . " the study found that business confidence for 2007 was slightly lower in the east of germany where 40 percent of those surveyed were optimistic compared to 58 percent in the west . across the country , the building sector showed the most significant rise in confidence , with 63 percent expecting better conditions in 2007 . the improved economic optimism comes despite the three-percent increase in germany 's value-added tax from 16 to 19 percent to be introduced on jan .
1 . according to grömling , the postive outlook for 2007 has more to with germany 's strong exports sector rather than domestic reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.12.2006 opinion : ahmadinejad is not a hero for level-headed people großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " holocaust conference " in tehran was less a meeting of minds and more of a " traveling circus " of holocaust deniers , says dw 's peter philipp . in the past few days , iranian authorities have once again launched an attack on the internet , blocking access to sites critical of the regime , those discussing movies and books and even to the free encyclopedia " wikipedia . "
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "
without the law suits which ensue , these people could not keep defining themselves anew and would be reduced to accepting what they actually are : sad lunatics . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad must be in a pretty poor position if he is forced to rally support from that league to further his political goals .
those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .
he is not interested in revealing historical truth , but rather , in exposing israel as an unjustified product of what he considers a genocide fallacy in order to strengthen his demands of abolishing israel . how grateful the president must have been that a handful of ultra-orthodox jews were present in the conference hall in tehran .
he did not notice , however , that it was precisely these participants who exposed the dismal strategy of the conference organizers .
they did not deny the holocaust , but they did stress that they reject israel as a nation .
orthodox jews believe that the jewish state may only evolve following the coming of the messiah . contrary to his portrayals of himself : mahmoud ahmadinejad is no messiah .
his agenda is damaging to iran , he forces level-headed iranians into desperation and he intimates people abroad who speak up for the legitimate interests of iran .

in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference . " i do n't think a dialogue is possible with people who deny the holocaust , " hilberg said . between history and politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before it opened , the teheran conference was condemned by germany , the us and israel .
bpb president thomas krüger said the berlin conference was designed to respond to the " absurd arguments " of iranian president ahmadinejad , who has questioned the existence of the holocaust and said israel should be wiped off the map . " doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .
he said he feels that given the rapid progress in holocaust research , there should be more opportunities for the public and the scientific community to debate the latest findings . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

" we have avoided a crisis over turkey " at the summit of eu leaders starting on thursday , beamed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , as they clinched the deal in defiance of all expectations . the talks had begun at around 9:30 a.m.

germany had contested the directive 's legal basis and wanted the partial annulment of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive bans tobacco companies from sponsoring events such as the formula one however , the luxembourg court rejected these arguments , saying that divergent national regulations on tobacco advertising impede the free movements of goods and the exchange of goods and services within the eu . in addition to banning tobacco advertising in print , radio and internet , the eu directive also bans tobacco sponsorship of cross-border cultural and sporting events . but advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising such as ash trays is still permitted , as is tobacco sponsorship at events which are purely local . tobacco advertising on television has been banned in the eu since the early 1990s . the rejection of germany 's challenge has only symbolic meaning , as the german lower house voted overwhelmingly in november in favor of the ban to bring germany in line with eu law .
the upper house still has to pass the law . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany dumps tobacco advertising to comply with eu the german parliament has voted to ban nearly all tobacco advertising to comply with european union mandates .
more anti-smoking legislation is on the horizon .
-lrb- 10.11.2006 -rrb- germany rejects federal smoking ban on constitutional grounds the decision to ban smoking in public places and restaurants is now up to germany 's federal states , due to constitutional wrinkles that complicate an outright nationwide ban .
-lrb- 08.12.2006 -rrb- government accused of bowing to tobacco lobby after announcing it will drop plans to enforce a full ban on smoking in restaurants , germany 's ruling coalition came under fire from the greens who accused the government of bowing to pressure from the tobacco lobby .

the meeting has been widely seen as a reaction to a controversial holocaust conference in iran . leading holocaust historians from all over the world gathered in berlin on monday to discuss the latest research results made available after the opening of important european archives in the 1990s . the conference - organized by the german federal agency for civic education -lrb- bpb -rrb- - is seen by many as a response to a two-day conference on the holocaust , which started in teheran on monday . us historian raul hilberg , the author of " destruction of the european jews , " which is widely considered one of the standard texts on the holocaust , said he wanted to make " a statement " by attending the berlin conference . " i do n't think a dialogue is possible with people who deny the holocaust , " hilberg said . between history and politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even before it opened , the teheran conference was condemned by germany , the us and israel .
bpb president thomas krüger said the berlin conference was designed to respond to the " absurd arguments " of iranian president ahmadinejad , who has questioned the existence of the holocaust and said israel should be wiped off the map . " doubting the holocaust and questioning the existence of israel are fundamental attacks on the democratic values of western societies , " krüger said . peter longerich from the research center for the holocaust and 20th century history at london university , however , said that seeing the berlin as a reaction to the gathering in iran was a connection being made largely by the media . " as somebody who is actively doing research in this area , i would say that our debate and our discussion are not influenced by systematic approaches to deny the holocaust , " longerich said .
" i do n't think that this conference is intellectually a reaction to what is going on somewhere else in the world . " understanding the holocaust longerich delivered a talk about the latest trends in international holocaust research .
he said that researchers now had a much better understanding of what sort of people the perpetrators were and now believed that there was n't a single specific order which resulted in the holocaust , but rather a string of decisions leaving nazi officials much room for interpretation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers now have a better understanding of the context in whicht the holocaust took place the opening of archives in eastern europe has also contributed to the researchers ' understanding of nazi policies and crimes that were committed during wwii . " a lot of work has been done after the opening of the eastern european archives in the beginning of the 1990s , " longerich said .
" we now have much more detailed picture of the holocaust in the countries in which mass murder took place .
we know much more about the former soviet union , about german-occupied parts of poland .
and we have a huge amount of works that open insights into the context of the holocaust . " longerich also criticized the fact that scientific conferences taking place in germany were few and far between .
he said he feels that given the rapid progress in holocaust research , there should be more opportunities for the public and the scientific community to debate the latest findings . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

"
in stark , albeit macabre contrast to those actions are the official explanations given for holding a " holocaust conference " : the government in tehran wanted to offer scientists from around the world the opportunity to say things about the holocaust which they are not permitted to say in their home countries . the people who gathered in tehran for the conference were hardly " scientists , " and instead more like the normal traveling circus of holocaust deniers who are not taken seriously anywhere .
they are also those for whom one is only doing a favor when one approves laws banning the notion of the " auschwitz lie . "
without the law suits which ensue , these people could not keep defining themselves anew and would be reduced to accepting what they actually are : sad lunatics . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad must be in a pretty poor position if he is forced to rally support from that league to further his political goals .
those in iran interested in history are well aware that ahmadinejad 's doubts about the holocaust are a completely unsubstantiated provocation .
he is not interested in revealing historical truth , but rather , in exposing israel as an unjustified product of what he considers a genocide fallacy in order to strengthen his demands of abolishing israel . how grateful the president must have been that a handful of ultra-orthodox jews were present in the conference hall in tehran .
he did not notice , however , that it was precisely these participants who exposed the dismal strategy of the conference organizers .
they did not deny the holocaust , but they did stress that they reject israel as a nation .
orthodox jews believe that the jewish state may only evolve following the coming of the messiah . contrary to his portrayals of himself : mahmoud ahmadinejad is no messiah .
his agenda is damaging to iran , he forces level-headed iranians into desperation and he intimates people abroad who speak up for the legitimate interests of iran .
he will not , however , abolish israel as he proceeds in this vein , and will not solve the israeli-palestinian conflict .
and only scatterbrains among palestinians and others in the arab world will consider ahmadinejad a hero .
most of these people have long been realistic enough to accept facts - such as israel and the holocaust - and to demand a historical compromise for the palestinian people so that palestinians and jews can finally live in peace and harmony . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- als -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

the lse takeover saga has been a lengthy one us stock market firm nasdaq has stepped in with a hostile takeover bid for the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- .
the £ 2.7bn -lrb- $ 5.1bn -rrb- approach direct to lse shareholders means that the future of the london market is uncertain once again .
what 's been going on ?
the battle for the lse has been a long one , kicking off in 2004 with an approach from germany 's deutsche boerse .
since then australia 's macquarie bank , uk brokerage icap and even the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- have been linked to bids .
as a result , lse shares have surged more than 110 % over the past year to highs above the £ 13 mark .
i do n't own any lse stocks , will a takeover affect me ?
while a takeover could mean a significant windfall for lse investors , the move will not have a direct effect on non-shareholders .
but it will affect them indirectly , mainly through pensions and savings .
many funds invest part of their money in shares with the aim of increasing their investment .
some savings schemes also rely on a similar system .
why is the lse seen as such an attractive bid target ?
london is becoming a more attractive place for us companies to do business as an international hub .
the lse has been described as a " tasty morsel , " with a " fantastic reputation " .
we intend to finance the acquisition by borrowing up to $ 5.1bn nasdaq statement nasdaq unveils hostile lse offer it is also very profitable , making a £ 76.7m profit in the past six months .
economists will tell you that people go to tokyo to do business in japan , new york to do business in the us , but they come to london to do business with the rest of the world .
also , london has a more flexible approach to both foreign companies and investors than the us does .
indeed , london has started to overtake new york as the major global financial centre as leading engines of economic growth switch away from the us .
the exchange is also seen as a relatively small company compared with many of its international rivals , which have branched out into other trading platforms .
why is the nasdaq going hostile ?
the lse board of directors had rejected its two previous approaches , saying that they undervalued the firm .
the lse also refused to any further meetings with nasdaq .
lse has so far managed to keep investors on side in the past by offering cash returns to shareholders .
there are worries about us regulation being imported to the uk in theory uk regulators could attempt to block the bid over regulatory concerns , but they have indicated that foreign ownership would not be a problem .
a previous approach from deutsche boerse had sparked competition worries as europe has only three major exchanges - lse , deutsche boerse and euronext .
other experts claim a us takeover could mean a change in the way the uk market is regulated .
the hassle of us regulation and its more onerous legal systems would also make london a less attractive place to list .
however , nasdaq has tried to ease these fears saying the uk 's financial services regulator would remain the sole watchdog for the market .
the government is also proposing legislation to ensure that firms listed in london would not be bound by us regulations should the lse be bought by a us company .
what 's in it for the lse ?
apart from swelling the pockets of shareholders , it is hard to tell immediately .
ownership by the nasdaq , for example , may do little to make the lse more efficient as nasdaq 's technology is significantly slower than lse 's .
the nasdaq 's approach had also prompted fears that its ability to invest in the lse would be undermined by its future debt burden .
what will happen now ?
nasdaq has taken the bid directly to lse 's shareholders , who have until 11 january to accept or ignore the £ 12.43 per share offer .
in the meantime the lse will be trying to convince its shareholders to reject the approach .
some experts believe the lse will be hunting for a " white knight " bidder that will rival nasdaq 's offer or even make a higher offer .

a salmonella scare in june forced the company to take more than a million chocolate bars off uk shelves .
cadbury said 2006 had seen strong sales across most of its businesses , offset by problems in the uk and nigeria .
it said there had been a " significant " overstatement of finances at its 50 % -owned subsidiary , cadbury nigeria .
cadbury nigeria is now set to report operating losses of £ 5m- £ 10m in 2006 and make a one-off exceptional charge of £ 55m- £ 60m to cover the overstatement .
health scare in a trading update , cadbury schweppes said its sales performance for 2006 was set to meet previous guidance , which estimated revenue growth of 4 % .
cadbury 's uk business suffered a blow when it withdrew a million bars of chocolate from sale in june after a pipe at its plant in marlbrook , herefordshire , caused salmonella contamination .
the company had previously estimated that this would cost the firm £ 20m , but said it had raised this to £ 30m " reflecting higher manufacturing and facility rectification and remediation costs " .
however , it noted that sales in the uk were improving in the run-up to christmas , with recently-launched products such as cadbury melts and flake dark performing well .
