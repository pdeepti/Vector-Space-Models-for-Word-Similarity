program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2006 the nordic wonderland of saunas , lakes and cell phones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely landscapes are only the beginning of what finland has to offer finland takes on the european council presidency in july and announced its plans wednesday .
press officer cita högnabba had lots of good things to report about her country .
but is it really such a wonderland ? on a wednesday last year , the italian ambassador dropped by the finnish foreign ministry in helsinki .
ugo gabriele de mohr had to apologize for then italian premier silvio berlusconi 's statement that finnish food was abominable . one year later , during a coffee break at the nordic embassies in berlin .
spider-leg candies , monster cookies and blood juice are also on offer .
the finnish rock band lordi had just won the eurovision song contest . " we sent the monsters and europe voted for them , " said cita högnabba , press and culture officer for the finnish government .
högnabba was about to give a presentation about her homeland in the embassy .
she did n't want to do be a propagandist .
but she really did n't have to . a + for fi n n ish schools since a study conducted by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- recognized finland as having the world 's best schools , germans have been more interested in learning about the country of saunas and lakes .
högnabba shows politicians and journalists around the schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masked monsters of lordi took the prize at this year 's eurovision song contest " it 's crucial that everyone gets a good basic education , " said the 49-year-old .
" we did away with the dead-end schools 40 years ago . " students in finland stay in one class until the ninth grade and receive a warm lunch every day .
children with language difficulties are given special attention .
integration problems are n't as common in finland as in germany , but foreigners make up only 2 percent of the population , while in germany the proportion is four times greater . parallel paths to success economically speaking , finland stands for nokia - or maybe it 's the other way around .
the rise of the world 's largest cell phone company was nearly simultaneous with finland 's ascent from post-iron curtain nadirs .
with jorma ollila as ceo and an emphasis on mobile phones , nokia landed on the path to success in 1992 .
the value of the company 's stock has grown by more than 400 percent since then . the national success story began with eu accession in 1995 .
according to transparency international , there is practically zero corruption in finland today .
productivity , economic growth and price stability are above average compared with the 15 older european union member states .
the public sector enjoys a surplus .
and the world economic forum has listed finland as the most competitive country in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's eonomic growth paralleled nokia 's upward climb in the mid 1990s " all that is the result of extensive reforms during the 1990s , " högnabba said . with the collapse of the soviet union , finland lost its most important trading partner and fell into a deep recession .
unemployment rose from 3.5 percent to 18 percent and the gross domestic product sank by 27 percent . " finland did n't have time to lose , " högnabba said .
" the difficult situation forced the society to make difficult decisions . " social spending was cut severely .
the crisis passed .
and finland became a role model country . gree n e n ergy a n d relatio n s with russia the inquiries will start piling up in högnabba 's mailbox on july 1 .
that 's when finland will begin chairing the council of europe for six months .
energy policy is one of the top priorities . after the catastrophe in chernobyl , the energy company tvo built the first european nuclear power plant in western finland .
" olkiluoto 3 " is supposed to be the most secure atomic reactor ever made , but the risk remains . " our experience with atomic energy has been positive , " said paavo lipponen , a former premier and the current president of finland 's parliament .
energy is produced in massive quantities , but none of it is greenhouse gas .
and as far as " green power " is concerned , need will exceed supply in the future , lipponen said . importantly , nuclear energy is not dependent on petroleum or natural gas from russia .
the relationship between the eu and russia will be another major issue during the finnish presidency .
finns are still skeptical of their big neighbor to the east .
surveys have revealed that the five million nordic residents are also among the biggest skeptics of the european union , where finns tend to feel underrepresented .
however , distrust of russia runs even deeper : finland was a russian province until 1917 . fu n ctio n al a n d elega n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the finnish eu council presidency and today ? " there 's no such thing as wonderland , " högnabba said .
" but finland has properly dealt with issues at many levels . " like many industrial nations , it faces the problem of an aging society .
there are already labor shortages in some sectors .
and , despite cuts in the past few years , taxes are still among the highest in the world . " but we also get something for it , " högnabba said . prime minister matti vanhanen on wednesday presented his plans for the european council presidency in parliament in helsinki .
one important point appeared early on the official web site of the future european council president . " finnish cuisine will play a key role in the catering , " it read .
" center pieces on the tables will be simple , but functional and elegant . " " italian cuisine is certainly better known , " högnabba said .
" but we see that as a challenge . " a challenge similar to this year 's eurovision song contest and , in the future , to soccer : after all , finland has yet to qualify for a final round of the world cup . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .

" that was incredible , " said rodriguez .
" it was a really tough game , with mexico making it very difficult for us but we came through in the end , " said rodriguez , who raced ecstatically to his bench to be embraced .
" now we are confident we can go further and beat anyone . " argentine coach jose pekerman said his side had taken their chance when it belatedly came . " it 's vital to take the chance when it arrives in as well-balanced a meeting as that between two rivals who know each other so well .
and we did - deservedly so , " pekerman said . " a magnificent game " mexico captain marquez ended this world cup as he had the last going out in the second round even if personally it was a happier ending than his red card against the united states in 2002 . however the barcelona defender was not too happy with the referee massimo busacca of switzerland . " various refereeing decisions went against us - but in the end the team that scores more goals wins .
we gave our all and it 's sad , " said the 27-year-old . " it was an even game , just as i expected it to be , and it was a magnificent individual goal that decided it , " said mexico coach lavolpe , himself a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad . " having said that , mexico gave an excellent account of themselves .
once again though , we did n't achieve what we came to do , which was to reach the quarter-finals at least . " mexico have twice been quarter-finalists , but on both occasions , in 1970 and 1986 , it was on home ground . they certainly had not shown any form in the group stages , scraping through with the 3-1 win over iran , an unconvincing 0-0 draw with angola and a 2-1 loss to group winners portugal . germany will prove a tough obstacle for the argentines as they looked an outstanding unit in the first-half demolishing a previously highly-regarded swedish defensive unit . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : argentina 6:0 serbia and montenegro argentina proved why some consider them a world cup title contender , displaying their speed and precision passing in a 6-0 rout of their group c opponents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2006 the nordic wonderland of saunas , lakes and cell phones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely landscapes are only the beginning of what finland has to offer finland takes on the european council presidency in july and announced its plans wednesday .
press officer cita högnabba had lots of good things to report about her country .
but is it really such a wonderland ? on a wednesday last year , the italian ambassador dropped by the finnish foreign ministry in helsinki .
ugo gabriele de mohr had to apologize for then italian premier silvio berlusconi 's statement that finnish food was abominable . one year later , during a coffee break at the nordic embassies in berlin .
spider-leg candies , monster cookies and blood juice are also on offer .
the finnish rock band lordi had just won the eurovision song contest . " we sent the monsters and europe voted for them , " said cita högnabba , press and culture officer for the finnish government .
högnabba was about to give a presentation about her homeland in the embassy .
she did n't want to do be a propagandist .
but she really did n't have to . a + for fi n n ish schools since a study conducted by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- recognized finland as having the world 's best schools , germans have been more interested in learning about the country of saunas and lakes .
högnabba shows politicians and journalists around the schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masked monsters of lordi took the prize at this year 's eurovision song contest " it 's crucial that everyone gets a good basic education , " said the 49-year-old .
" we did away with the dead-end schools 40 years ago . " students in finland stay in one class until the ninth grade and receive a warm lunch every day .
children with language difficulties are given special attention .
integration problems are n't as common in finland as in germany , but foreigners make up only 2 percent of the population , while in germany the proportion is four times greater . parallel paths to success economically speaking , finland stands for nokia - or maybe it 's the other way around .
the rise of the world 's largest cell phone company was nearly simultaneous with finland 's ascent from post-iron curtain nadirs .
with jorma ollila as ceo and an emphasis on mobile phones , nokia landed on the path to success in 1992 .
the value of the company 's stock has grown by more than 400 percent since then . the national success story began with eu accession in 1995 .
according to transparency international , there is practically zero corruption in finland today .
productivity , economic growth and price stability are above average compared with the 15 older european union member states .
the public sector enjoys a surplus .
and the world economic forum has listed finland as the most competitive country in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's eonomic growth paralleled nokia 's upward climb in the mid 1990s " all that is the result of extensive reforms during the 1990s , " högnabba said . with the collapse of the soviet union , finland lost its most important trading partner and fell into a deep recession .
unemployment rose from 3.5 percent to 18 percent and the gross domestic product sank by 27 percent . " finland did n't have time to lose , " högnabba said .
" the difficult situation forced the society to make difficult decisions . " social spending was cut severely .
the crisis passed .
and finland became a role model country . gree n e n ergy a n d relatio n s with russia the inquiries will start piling up in högnabba 's mailbox on july 1 .
that 's when finland will begin chairing the council of europe for six months .
energy policy is one of the top priorities . after the catastrophe in chernobyl , the energy company tvo built the first european nuclear power plant in western finland .
" olkiluoto 3 " is supposed to be the most secure atomic reactor ever made , but the risk remains . " our experience with atomic energy has been positive , " said paavo lipponen , a former premier and the current president of finland 's parliament .
energy is produced in massive quantities , but none of it is greenhouse gas .
and as far as " green power " is concerned , need will exceed supply in the future , lipponen said . importantly , nuclear energy is not dependent on petroleum or natural gas from russia .
the relationship between the eu and russia will be another major issue during the finnish presidency .
finns are still skeptical of their big neighbor to the east .
surveys have revealed that the five million nordic residents are also among the biggest skeptics of the european union , where finns tend to feel underrepresented .
however , distrust of russia runs even deeper : finland was a russian province until 1917 . fu n ctio n al a n d elega n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the finnish eu council presidency and today ? " there 's no such thing as wonderland , " högnabba said .
" but finland has properly dealt with issues at many levels . " like many industrial nations , it faces the problem of an aging society .
there are already labor shortages in some sectors .
and , despite cuts in the past few years , taxes are still among the highest in the world . " but we also get something for it , " högnabba said . prime minister matti vanhanen on wednesday presented his plans for the european council presidency in parliament in helsinki .
one important point appeared early on the official web site of the future european council president . " finnish cuisine will play a key role in the catering , " it read .
" center pieces on the tables will be simple , but functional and elegant . " " italian cuisine is certainly better known , " högnabba said .
" but we see that as a challenge . " a challenge similar to this year 's eurovision song contest and , in the future , to soccer : after all , finland has yet to qualify for a final round of the world cup . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .
-lrb- april 6 , 2006 -rrb- finnish monster rockers conquer eurovision finnish heavy metal band lordi kept their promise to " bring rock to eurovision " , handing their country its first title in the annual song contest 's 51-year history with an explosive victory in athens early sunday .

press officer cita högnabba had lots of good things to report about her country .
but is it really such a wonderland ? on a wednesday last year , the italian ambassador dropped by the finnish foreign ministry in helsinki .
ugo gabriele de mohr had to apologize for then italian premier silvio berlusconi 's statement that finnish food was abominable . one year later , during a coffee break at the nordic embassies in berlin .
spider-leg candies , monster cookies and blood juice are also on offer .
the finnish rock band lordi had just won the eurovision song contest . " we sent the monsters and europe voted for them , " said cita högnabba , press and culture officer for the finnish government .
högnabba was about to give a presentation about her homeland in the embassy .
she did n't want to do be a propagandist .
but she really did n't have to . a + for fi n n ish schools since a study conducted by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- recognized finland as having the world 's best schools , germans have been more interested in learning about the country of saunas and lakes .
högnabba shows politicians and journalists around the schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masked monsters of lordi took the prize at this year 's eurovision song contest " it 's crucial that everyone gets a good basic education , " said the 49-year-old .
" we did away with the dead-end schools 40 years ago . " students in finland stay in one class until the ninth grade and receive a warm lunch every day .
children with language difficulties are given special attention .
integration problems are n't as common in finland as in germany , but foreigners make up only 2 percent of the population , while in germany the proportion is four times greater . parallel paths to success economically speaking , finland stands for nokia - or maybe it 's the other way around .
the rise of the world 's largest cell phone company was nearly simultaneous with finland 's ascent from post-iron curtain nadirs .
with jorma ollila as ceo and an emphasis on mobile phones , nokia landed on the path to success in 1992 .
the value of the company 's stock has grown by more than 400 percent since then . the national success story began with eu accession in 1995 .
according to transparency international , there is practically zero corruption in finland today .
productivity , economic growth and price stability are above average compared with the 15 older european union member states .
the public sector enjoys a surplus .

along the way , portugal beat holland 1-0 .
but the story of four players off and eight others booked will make all the headlines . portugal booked a world cup quarter-final with england on sunday with an ill-tempered 1-0 win over the netherlands in which both teams had two players sent off . russian referee valentin ivanov brandished a record 20 cards in total - 16 of them yellow - as portugal scraped through to extend coach luiz felipe scolari 's record world cup winning streak to 11 matches . ugly scenes marred the match as first costinha , then khalid boulahrouz , then deco and finally giovanni van bronckhorst saw red . portugal went 1-0 up after 23 minutes but put themselves in trouble when costinha received his second yellow just before half-time . early offenses set the tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce lee would have been proud they also lost cristiano ronaldo to a right thigh injury .
but boulahrouz received his marching orders for elbowing luis figo - who himself was fortunate to stay on the pitch after head butting mark van bommel who belatedly and theatrically collapsed to the ground - before deco was dismissed for throwing away the ball . van bronckhorst trudged off in the dying seconds of the match , killing off the netherlands ' faint hopes of taking it into extra time . the disciplinary nightmare marred a promising encounter between two of the tournament 's form teams who had amassed 32 matches unbeaten between them . it was marco van basten 's first competitive defeat as dutch coach and leaves the netherlands still waiting for their first win against portugal since 1991 . maniche was on target for his second goal of the tournament as the euro 2004 finalists cut their way through the dutch defense after 23 minutes , putting them on course for a quarter-final with england . maniche , who also scored a blinder against the dutch in the 2-1 victory in the euro 2004 semi-finals , said that the victory was a team effort .
" we are a talented squad and we deserved the victory , " he said . referee blamed for ruining spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalid boulahrouz was one of four players to see red however he blamed the referee for overreacting to what he thought was not a violent match .
" the referee did not contribute to the spectacle , " said the 28-year-old .
" i do n't think that it was such a violent match to merit so many sendings off , " added maniche . pauleta come close to making it two in the final seconds of the half but was denied by edwin van der sar 's fine reflex save . however , portugal received a double blow when a tearful ronaldo was subbed off and costinha received his marching orders for a second bookable offence . ronaldo had been struggling with a thigh problem since going down under a heavy challenge from boulahrouz . the dutch almost got off to a flying start with van bommel firing just wide in the first minute . robin van persie also sent one thudding against the advertising boards and arjen robben failed to get a meaningful shot away after a neat interchange with dirk kuyt , who replaced misfiring striker ruud van nistelrooy . maniche breaks dutch hearts as he did in 2004 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one goal sealed the game but 20 cards decided it but it was portugal who broke the deadlock when pauleta met a cross from the irrepressible deco , teeing it up for maniche who made space for himself before finishing with his right foot . suddenly the dutch attack looked toothless with robben struggling under the close attentions of miguel and kuyt also finding himself locked down . but van persie sparked them back into life with a twisting run that turned the portuguese defense inside-out before shooting wide . robben had a penalty appeal turned down when he received studs in his shoulder after a knock-on from kuyt . the dutch signaled their intent immediately after half-time when phillip cocu hit the bar and van bommel had a skidding effort scrambled wide by ricardo . kuyt also saw a good effort parried by ricardo before maniche tested edwin van der sar at the other end . but the match threatened to disintegrate after an hour when figo , angry about a foul on deco , was booked for head butting van bommel . minutes later boulahrouz elbowed figo on the left touchline , earning his second yellow and sparking a furious shoving match between the two benches . soccer took a back seat for ten crazy minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach marco van basten ca n't believe what he 's seeing more trouble followed when wesley sneijder shoved petit away from the prone john heitinga , who had been fouled by deco . deco 's dismissal with just over 10 minutes left incensed scolari , who had been on and off his bench all night . meanwhile the netherlands were growing increasingly desperate with kuyt firing straight at ricardo one-on-one before seeing an acrobatic effort blocked . but the dutch challenge was effectively grounded by van bronckhorst 's late dismissal and the elated portuguese burst into celebration on the final whistle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch quietly confident about knocking out portugal the netherlands are confident they can break a 15-year hex and avenge their euro 2004 semi-final defeat by sending portugal crashing out of the world cup on sunday .

but boulahrouz received his marching orders for elbowing luis figo - who himself was fortunate to stay on the pitch after head butting mark van bommel who belatedly and theatrically collapsed to the ground - before deco was dismissed for throwing away the ball . van bronckhorst trudged off in the dying seconds of the match , killing off the netherlands ' faint hopes of taking it into extra time . the disciplinary nightmare marred a promising encounter between two of the tournament 's form teams who had amassed 32 matches unbeaten between them . it was marco van basten 's first competitive defeat as dutch coach and leaves the netherlands still waiting for their first win against portugal since 1991 . maniche was on target for his second goal of the tournament as the euro 2004 finalists cut their way through the dutch defense after 23 minutes , putting them on course for a quarter-final with england . maniche , who also scored a blinder against the dutch in the 2-1 victory in the euro 2004 semi-finals , said that the victory was a team effort .
" we are a talented squad and we deserved the victory , " he said . referee blamed for ruining spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalid boulahrouz was one of four players to see red however he blamed the referee for overreacting to what he thought was not a violent match .
" the referee did not contribute to the spectacle , " said the 28-year-old .
" i do n't think that it was such a violent match to merit so many sendings off , " added maniche . pauleta come close to making it two in the final seconds of the half but was denied by edwin van der sar 's fine reflex save . however , portugal received a double blow when a tearful ronaldo was subbed off and costinha received his marching orders for a second bookable offence . ronaldo had been struggling with a thigh problem since going down under a heavy challenge from boulahrouz . the dutch almost got off to a flying start with van bommel firing just wide in the first minute . robin van persie also sent one thudding against the advertising boards and arjen robben failed to get a meaningful shot away after a neat interchange with dirk kuyt , who replaced misfiring striker ruud van nistelrooy . maniche breaks dutch hearts as he did in 2004 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one goal sealed the game but 20 cards decided it but it was portugal who broke the deadlock when pauleta met a cross from the irrepressible deco , teeing it up for maniche who made space for himself before finishing with his right foot . suddenly the dutch attack looked toothless with robben struggling under the close attentions of miguel and kuyt also finding himself locked down . but van persie sparked them back into life with a twisting run that turned the portuguese defense inside-out before shooting wide . robben had a penalty appeal turned down when he received studs in his shoulder after a knock-on from kuyt . the dutch signaled their intent immediately after half-time when phillip cocu hit the bar and van bommel had a skidding effort scrambled wide by ricardo . kuyt also saw a good effort parried by ricardo before maniche tested edwin van der sar at the other end . but the match threatened to disintegrate after an hour when figo , angry about a foul on deco , was booked for head butting van bommel . minutes later boulahrouz elbowed figo on the left touchline , earning his second yellow and sparking a furious shoving match between the two benches . soccer took a back seat for ten crazy minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach marco van basten ca n't believe what he 's seeing more trouble followed when wesley sneijder shoved petit away from the prone john heitinga , who had been fouled by deco . deco 's dismissal with just over 10 minutes left incensed scolari , who had been on and off his bench all night . meanwhile the netherlands were growing increasingly desperate with kuyt firing straight at ricardo one-on-one before seeing an acrobatic effort blocked . but the dutch challenge was effectively grounded by van bronckhorst 's late dismissal and the elated portuguese burst into celebration on the final whistle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch quietly confident about knocking out portugal the netherlands are confident they can break a 15-year hex and avenge their euro 2004 semi-final defeat by sending portugal crashing out of the world cup on sunday .

england 's creative midfield confined itself to long balls aimed at striker wayne rooney , while ecuador waited for a mistake by their opponents . they got it in the tenth minute .
defender john terry badly misjudged the ball , leaving ecuador striker carlos tenorio seemingly alone in front of the goal .
but defender ashley cole managed to get a leg in to deflect tenorio 's shot wide . that was it for early goal chances .
aside from a couple of david beckham free kicks , the lions were toothless , and the first half ended in a goalless draw . the second half started in equally languid fashion , with both teams looking as though they 'd rather be at the pool .
extra time and penalties seemed inevitable . then england 's captain came up trumps .
after an hour of play , david beckham curled one of his patented free-kicks past ecuadoran keeper cristian mora and into the lower left-hand corner to put the english up 1-0 .
beckham 's heroic shot is sure to silence critics at home who had called for him to be removed from the starting eleven . ecuador , while solid in defense , could n't manufacture any chances up front - especially as their top striker carlos tenorio had to be taken out with an ankle injury in the 70th minute . england ran down the clock to get a crucial win in a tepid match and keep alive their bid for their first world cup title in forty years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : england 1:0 ecuador review all the action as it happened with dw-world.de 's live ticker .

ecuador will hit hard and hope to snatch the victory . england 's players will know that they will have to sustain a 90-minute performance similar to their first half display against sweden in their final group b match if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals of the world cup at ecuador 's expense on sunday . after disappointing against paraguay and trinidad and tobago , sven goran eriksson 's team finally showed some cohesion in the first 45 minutes against the swedes with some positive attacking and crisp passing .
however , nerves and confusion set in after the restart and england were lucky to escape with the draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england will need all the support they can get england 's unnerving habit of falling apart after half-time will have to be curbed against south america 's surprise outfit who have shown that they can hit tentative teams at pace and score important goals against shaky defenses .
captain david beckham knows all about second-half collapses after suffering heartache against brazil at the 2002 world cup and portugal in euro 2004 . " there 's no excuses this time , " beckham said .
" in the past we 've gone out of competitions at stages when we should have gone further .
it 's up to us now - we 're the ones who can progress as a team . " a new england line-up ? the team that aims to avoid a similar defeat against ecuador in the first knock-out stage in stuttgart is likely to be a different one to that which snatched a draw from the teeth of victory in cologne last tuesday . right back gary neville is still out with a calf injury and central defender rio ferdinand is still a doubt .
eriksson is expected to shunt owen hargreaves , who had a good game against sweden in the holding midfield role , into the right back slot while sol campbell will deputize for ferdinand .
jamie carragher will be on the bench . michael carrick is expected to sit in front of the back four as the holding player in a 4-1-4-1 formation with joe cole and david beckham on the flanks and frank lampard and steve gerrard in the center .
wayne rooney is expected to play as a lone striker , meaning there is no starting place for peter crouch . with gerrard operating behind rooney at the tip of a midfield diamond , eriksson hopes the liverpool captain will provide the extra firepower now lacking after the injury to michael owen .
carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .
" what we have done is not all , " suarez said .
" there is more to come .
the world cup has not ended for ecuador . " " there is no reason for us to feel beaten before the match .
if we are going to lose , let it be during the match , not before . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's on a roll ecuador looked impressive when beating poland 2-0 and costa rica 3-0 in their opening matches and suarez is confident his side can recover that form .
" the team are happy about what they 've done so far , " he said " we have already earned respect .
i hope we continue to make history . " ecuador 's midfield playmaker edison mendez is an injury doubt as he battles a leg muscle strain .
" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters . " he is undergoing tests and we do n't know if he will make it or not , " suarez added , explaining mendez , scorer of five goals in qualifying , had not made the training session and was having a scan . " if mendez does make it the line-up will be the same as in the first two matches , " suarez said , having sent out a second-string side for the final group a match against germany , which ended in a 3-0 defeat on the back of wins over poland and costa rica . in those two games , the south american minnows lined up with cristian mora in goal , aston villa 's ulises de la cruz , ivan hurtado , geovanny espinoza and neicer reasco at the back , luis valencia , segundo castillo , edwin tenorio and mendez in midfield and former southampton man agustin delgado and carlos tenorio in attack .

but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty as well as save one . save a goal in a penalty shoot-out and you win stardom , miss and you may be turned back at the border on the way home .
in a split-second moment , you 're either hero or villain . but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty .
new details on the type of research roberto baggio and stuart pearce would have loved could be available for players lining up from the spot now that the 2006 cup has reached the knock-out stage . there are a number of ways sports physicists and psychologists say they can enhance the chances of players on either side of the ball . what the scientists say one of them is in training keepers in body language .
goalies who are alert to the kicker 's eyes , body posture and angle of his feet in the approach can gain as much as half a second to move in the right direction . scientists at john moores university in liverpool showed goalkeepers life-sized video footage of penalties being taken , filmed from the viewpoint of a keeper standing in the center of the goal . the film was stopped four times during the sequence - 120 milliseconds before the kick ; 40 milliseconds before ; at the point of impact ; and 40 milliseconds after - and the goalkeepers were asked at each stage to predict where the ball was going to be shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , considered to be the best in the world researchers found that the biggest clue was the position of the striker 's hips just before the strike . " if the taker 's hips are square-on to the goalkeeper in a right-footed kicker , the penalty goes to the right-hand side of the keeper , " the university 's mark williams said .
" if his hips are more ' open , ' or angled away from the goalkeeper , the kick tends to go to the left of the keeper . " research is two-sided but there are some shots that just ca n't be saved .
a study in biomechanics carried out at the university of bath in 2004 determined the maximum reach of a goalie 's dive , regardless of his size . it showed that , if the keeper stays on his line in accordance with the rules - which only the most inexperienced keepers bother with - 28 percent of the goal is an " unsaveable zone " that guarantees a score , provided the ball is kicked accurately and with reasonable force . but if you have to choose between placement and force , research shows blasting the ball to be the way to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hit your penalties as hard as possible " " hit your penalties as hard as possible , " kassam advised .
" research indicates that a penalty struck at more than 20 meters per second -lrb- 73 kilometers , 46 miles per hour -rrb- stands a greater chance of hitting the back of the net than a slower one , as a goalkeeper has less time to analyze visual clues and react . " according to fifa statistics , the kicker holds all the cards .
in the history of the tournament , 182 penalties have been awarded with 147 converted or 81 percent .
thirty-five have been missed with 22 of those blocked by the keeper . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .
could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ?
-lrb- may 29 , 2006 -rrb- do n't believe the hype : pre-cup favorites struggle through they arrived brimming with confidence , laden with stars and shouldering expectation .
the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks .
-lrb- june 24 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : stop talking balls and get on with it for a striker there is no better feeling : seeing that beautifully struck shot fly in .
with a ball designed to enhance these possibilities , goal scorers are having a field day .
the goalies , however , are far from happy .

but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty as well as save one . save a goal in a penalty shoot-out and you win stardom , miss and you may be turned back at the border on the way home .
in a split-second moment , you 're either hero or villain . but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty .
new details on the type of research roberto baggio and stuart pearce would have loved could be available for players lining up from the spot now that the 2006 cup has reached the knock-out stage . there are a number of ways sports physicists and psychologists say they can enhance the chances of players on either side of the ball . what the scientists say one of them is in training keepers in body language .
goalies who are alert to the kicker 's eyes , body posture and angle of his feet in the approach can gain as much as half a second to move in the right direction . scientists at john moores university in liverpool showed goalkeepers life-sized video footage of penalties being taken , filmed from the viewpoint of a keeper standing in the center of the goal . the film was stopped four times during the sequence - 120 milliseconds before the kick ; 40 milliseconds before ; at the point of impact ; and 40 milliseconds after - and the goalkeepers were asked at each stage to predict where the ball was going to be shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , considered to be the best in the world researchers found that the biggest clue was the position of the striker 's hips just before the strike . " if the taker 's hips are square-on to the goalkeeper in a right-footed kicker , the penalty goes to the right-hand side of the keeper , " the university 's mark williams said .
" if his hips are more ' open , ' or angled away from the goalkeeper , the kick tends to go to the left of the keeper . " research is two-sided but there are some shots that just ca n't be saved .
a study in biomechanics carried out at the university of bath in 2004 determined the maximum reach of a goalie 's dive , regardless of his size . it showed that , if the keeper stays on his line in accordance with the rules - which only the most inexperienced keepers bother with - 28 percent of the goal is an " unsaveable zone " that guarantees a score , provided the ball is kicked accurately and with reasonable force . but if you have to choose between placement and force , research shows blasting the ball to be the way to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hit your penalties as hard as possible " " hit your penalties as hard as possible , " kassam advised .
" research indicates that a penalty struck at more than 20 meters per second -lrb- 73 kilometers , 46 miles per hour -rrb- stands a greater chance of hitting the back of the net than a slower one , as a goalkeeper has less time to analyze visual clues and react . " according to fifa statistics , the kicker holds all the cards .
in the history of the tournament , 182 penalties have been awarded with 147 converted or 81 percent .
thirty-five have been missed with 22 of those blocked by the keeper . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .
could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ?
-lrb- may 29 , 2006 -rrb- do n't believe the hype : pre-cup favorites struggle through they arrived brimming with confidence , laden with stars and shouldering expectation .
the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks .
-lrb- june 24 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : stop talking balls and get on with it for a striker there is no better feeling : seeing that beautifully struck shot fly in .
with a ball designed to enhance these possibilities , goal scorers are having a field day .
the goalies , however , are far from happy .

along the way , portugal beat holland 1-0 .
but the story of four players off and eight others booked will make all the headlines . portugal booked a world cup quarter-final with england on sunday with an ill-tempered 1-0 win over the netherlands in which both teams had two players sent off . russian referee valentin ivanov brandished a record 20 cards in total - 16 of them yellow - as portugal scraped through to extend coach luiz felipe scolari 's record world cup winning streak to 11 matches . ugly scenes marred the match as first costinha , then khalid boulahrouz , then deco and finally giovanni van bronckhorst saw red . portugal went 1-0 up after 23 minutes but put themselves in trouble when costinha received his second yellow just before half-time . early offenses set the tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce lee would have been proud they also lost cristiano ronaldo to a right thigh injury .
but boulahrouz received his marching orders for elbowing luis figo - who himself was fortunate to stay on the pitch after head butting mark van bommel who belatedly and theatrically collapsed to the ground - before deco was dismissed for throwing away the ball . van bronckhorst trudged off in the dying seconds of the match , killing off the netherlands ' faint hopes of taking it into extra time . the disciplinary nightmare marred a promising encounter between two of the tournament 's form teams who had amassed 32 matches unbeaten between them . it was marco van basten 's first competitive defeat as dutch coach and leaves the netherlands still waiting for their first win against portugal since 1991 . maniche was on target for his second goal of the tournament as the euro 2004 finalists cut their way through the dutch defense after 23 minutes , putting them on course for a quarter-final with england . maniche , who also scored a blinder against the dutch in the 2-1 victory in the euro 2004 semi-finals , said that the victory was a team effort .
" we are a talented squad and we deserved the victory , " he said . referee blamed for ruining spectacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalid boulahrouz was one of four players to see red however he blamed the referee for overreacting to what he thought was not a violent match .
" the referee did not contribute to the spectacle , " said the 28-year-old .
" i do n't think that it was such a violent match to merit so many sendings off , " added maniche . pauleta come close to making it two in the final seconds of the half but was denied by edwin van der sar 's fine reflex save . however , portugal received a double blow when a tearful ronaldo was subbed off and costinha received his marching orders for a second bookable offence . ronaldo had been struggling with a thigh problem since going down under a heavy challenge from boulahrouz . the dutch almost got off to a flying start with van bommel firing just wide in the first minute . robin van persie also sent one thudding against the advertising boards and arjen robben failed to get a meaningful shot away after a neat interchange with dirk kuyt , who replaced misfiring striker ruud van nistelrooy . maniche breaks dutch hearts as he did in 2004 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one goal sealed the game but 20 cards decided it but it was portugal who broke the deadlock when pauleta met a cross from the irrepressible deco , teeing it up for maniche who made space for himself before finishing with his right foot . suddenly the dutch attack looked toothless with robben struggling under the close attentions of miguel and kuyt also finding himself locked down . but van persie sparked them back into life with a twisting run that turned the portuguese defense inside-out before shooting wide . robben had a penalty appeal turned down when he received studs in his shoulder after a knock-on from kuyt . the dutch signaled their intent immediately after half-time when phillip cocu hit the bar and van bommel had a skidding effort scrambled wide by ricardo . kuyt also saw a good effort parried by ricardo before maniche tested edwin van der sar at the other end . but the match threatened to disintegrate after an hour when figo , angry about a foul on deco , was booked for head butting van bommel . minutes later boulahrouz elbowed figo on the left touchline , earning his second yellow and sparking a furious shoving match between the two benches . soccer took a back seat for ten crazy minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach marco van basten ca n't believe what he 's seeing more trouble followed when wesley sneijder shoved petit away from the prone john heitinga , who had been fouled by deco . deco 's dismissal with just over 10 minutes left incensed scolari , who had been on and off his bench all night . meanwhile the netherlands were growing increasingly desperate with kuyt firing straight at ricardo one-on-one before seeing an acrobatic effort blocked . but the dutch challenge was effectively grounded by van bronckhorst 's late dismissal and the elated portuguese burst into celebration on the final whistle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch quietly confident about knocking out portugal the netherlands are confident they can break a 15-year hex and avenge their euro 2004 semi-final defeat by sending portugal crashing out of the world cup on sunday .

but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty as well as save one . save a goal in a penalty shoot-out and you win stardom , miss and you may be turned back at the border on the way home .
in a split-second moment , you 're either hero or villain . but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty .
new details on the type of research roberto baggio and stuart pearce would have loved could be available for players lining up from the spot now that the 2006 cup has reached the knock-out stage . there are a number of ways sports physicists and psychologists say they can enhance the chances of players on either side of the ball . what the scientists say one of them is in training keepers in body language .
goalies who are alert to the kicker 's eyes , body posture and angle of his feet in the approach can gain as much as half a second to move in the right direction . scientists at john moores university in liverpool showed goalkeepers life-sized video footage of penalties being taken , filmed from the viewpoint of a keeper standing in the center of the goal . the film was stopped four times during the sequence - 120 milliseconds before the kick ; 40 milliseconds before ; at the point of impact ; and 40 milliseconds after - and the goalkeepers were asked at each stage to predict where the ball was going to be shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , considered to be the best in the world researchers found that the biggest clue was the position of the striker 's hips just before the strike . " if the taker 's hips are square-on to the goalkeeper in a right-footed kicker , the penalty goes to the right-hand side of the keeper , " the university 's mark williams said .
" if his hips are more ' open , ' or angled away from the goalkeeper , the kick tends to go to the left of the keeper . " research is two-sided but there are some shots that just ca n't be saved .
a study in biomechanics carried out at the university of bath in 2004 determined the maximum reach of a goalie 's dive , regardless of his size . it showed that , if the keeper stays on his line in accordance with the rules - which only the most inexperienced keepers bother with - 28 percent of the goal is an " unsaveable zone " that guarantees a score , provided the ball is kicked accurately and with reasonable force . but if you have to choose between placement and force , research shows blasting the ball to be the way to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hit your penalties as hard as possible " " hit your penalties as hard as possible , " kassam advised .
" research indicates that a penalty struck at more than 20 meters per second -lrb- 73 kilometers , 46 miles per hour -rrb- stands a greater chance of hitting the back of the net than a slower one , as a goalkeeper has less time to analyze visual clues and react . " according to fifa statistics , the kicker holds all the cards .
in the history of the tournament , 182 penalties have been awarded with 147 converted or 81 percent .
thirty-five have been missed with 22 of those blocked by the keeper . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

ecuador will hit hard and hope to snatch the victory . england 's players will know that they will have to sustain a 90-minute performance similar to their first half display against sweden in their final group b match if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals of the world cup at ecuador 's expense on sunday . after disappointing against paraguay and trinidad and tobago , sven goran eriksson 's team finally showed some cohesion in the first 45 minutes against the swedes with some positive attacking and crisp passing .

eriksson is expected to shunt owen hargreaves , who had a good game against sweden in the holding midfield role , into the right back slot while sol campbell will deputize for ferdinand .
jamie carragher will be on the bench . michael carrick is expected to sit in front of the back four as the holding player in a 4-1-4-1 formation with joe cole and david beckham on the flanks and frank lampard and steve gerrard in the center .
wayne rooney is expected to play as a lone striker , meaning there is no starting place for peter crouch . with gerrard operating behind rooney at the tip of a midfield diamond , eriksson hopes the liverpool captain will provide the extra firepower now lacking after the injury to michael owen .
carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .
" what we have done is not all , " suarez said .
" there is more to come .
the world cup has not ended for ecuador . " " there is no reason for us to feel beaten before the match .

i hope we continue to make history . " ecuador 's midfield playmaker edison mendez is an injury doubt as he battles a leg muscle strain .
" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters .

ecuador will hit hard and hope to snatch the victory . england 's players will know that they will have to sustain a 90-minute performance similar to their first half display against sweden in their final group b match if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals of the world cup at ecuador 's expense on sunday . after disappointing against paraguay and trinidad and tobago , sven goran eriksson 's team finally showed some cohesion in the first 45 minutes against the swedes with some positive attacking and crisp passing .

eriksson is expected to shunt owen hargreaves , who had a good game against sweden in the holding midfield role , into the right back slot while sol campbell will deputize for ferdinand .
jamie carragher will be on the bench . michael carrick is expected to sit in front of the back four as the holding player in a 4-1-4-1 formation with joe cole and david beckham on the flanks and frank lampard and steve gerrard in the center .
wayne rooney is expected to play as a lone striker , meaning there is no starting place for peter crouch . with gerrard operating behind rooney at the tip of a midfield diamond , eriksson hopes the liverpool captain will provide the extra firepower now lacking after the injury to michael owen .
carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .

" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters .

" that was incredible , " said rodriguez .
" it was a really tough game , with mexico making it very difficult for us but we came through in the end , " said rodriguez , who raced ecstatically to his bench to be embraced .
" now we are confident we can go further and beat anyone . " argentine coach jose pekerman said his side had taken their chance when it belatedly came . " it 's vital to take the chance when it arrives in as well-balanced a meeting as that between two rivals who know each other so well .
and we did - deservedly so , " pekerman said . " a magnificent game " mexico captain marquez ended this world cup as he had the last going out in the second round even if personally it was a happier ending than his red card against the united states in 2002 . however the barcelona defender was not too happy with the referee massimo busacca of switzerland . " various refereeing decisions went against us - but in the end the team that scores more goals wins .
we gave our all and it 's sad , " said the 27-year-old . " it was an even game , just as i expected it to be , and it was a magnificent individual goal that decided it , " said mexico coach lavolpe , himself a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad . " having said that , mexico gave an excellent account of themselves .

the netherlands are confident they can break a 15-year hex and avenge their euro 2004 semi-final defeat by sending portugal crashing out of the world cup on sunday . the dutch have not beaten portugal since 1991 but marco van basten 's remodeled team believe destiny is on their side ahead of the second-round clash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch are hoping they 'll be able to lift a 15-year curse " portugal beat us two years ago , but the next game is something completely different .
this is a new , young team , and we have new ideas , " said striker ruud van nistelrooy . two years ago , goals from cristiano ronaldo and maniche broke dutch hearts on a frenetic night in lisbon .
previously , portugal wrecked the netherlands ' 2002 world cup qualifying campaign with an away win and home draw . but the netherlands have not lost a competitive match since that semi-final after van basten took over from dick advocaat . " now , up against portugal , we have to forget about the trauma of euro 2004 , " said defensive midfield general phillip cocu .
" do n't look at the past , but only think about playing a good match . " formidable task the netherlands will be under no illusions about the size of the task , with world cup-winning coach scolari masterminding a portuguese record of 17 matches unbeaten . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch will be watching out for portugal 's cristiano ronaldo but despite portugal 's quality , and scolari 's unmatched world cup pedigree , van basten remains quietly confident .
" now we 're up against portugal .
we know they 're excellent but we 're also not bad , " he said .
" preparations will not change .
if we 're lucky , we 've got four finals to go , matches where you can make no errors because you can not go back on them . " van basten can turn to giovanni van bronckhorst and arjen robben , who were rested for the final group match with argentina . the former dutch great may also bench van nistelrooy in favor of feyenoord marksman dirk kuyt after aiming criticism at the manchester united man .
" ruud has not been good .
he has n't been on form in the first matches , " van basten said .
" he has to give us a lot more . " goalkeeper edwin van der sar is expected to win his 113th cap , beating frank de boer 's dutch record . portugal on target scolari meanwhile goes into the game on a record 10-match world cup winning streak , including seven as he led his native brazil to the title in 2002 . wins against angola , iran and mexico saw portugal through group d with maximum points and minimum fuss , with the brazilian even able to rest five first-team players for the final match . lisbon scorers ronaldo and maniche were both on target in the first round as portugal reached the knock-out stages for the first time since 1966 . " it 's only the second time portugal has qualified for the second round in 40 years but we have to look at it game by game , " scolari said .
" all the teams are very balanced and very even , they 're in good condition .
there are five or six teams which i believe are the best , they might be playing very well but one day they can have an off-day and be eliminated . " portugal will welcome back ronaldo , deco , pauleta and nuno valente , who were all stood down against mexico as a precaution against them getting a second yellow card . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch victory breaks hearts in ivory coast with everything at stake in the " group of death , " the ivory coast gave the holland a run for their money throughout a pulsating match that saw seven yellow cards before ending 2-1 in the netherlands ' favor .

slight as that might be , there are still more millionaires here than anywhere else in the world apart from the us and japan . the 10th world wealth report published by consultants capgemini and us investment bank merrill lynch revealed that in 2005 , germany was home to a total of 767,000 high net worth individuals -lrb- hnwi -rrb- - private investors with a fortune of over $ 1 million -lrb- 791,000 euros -rrb- or property worth an equal amount . the report has germany tailing the us , with its 2.6 million millionaires , and japan , with 1.4 million - while world-wide , the number of hnwis climbed 6.5 percent to a total of 8.7 million . hard to make mo n ey i n germa n y it seems that it 's harder to augment a fortune in germany than elsewhere on the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , noone was buying " like the year before , there were no new fortunes made in 2005 despite positive developments on the stock market and rising productivity , " achim küssner , german ceo of merrill lynch investment managers , told ha n delsblatt . " inhibiting factors included depressed consumer confidence caused by persistent unemployment and the low rise in wage costs ; the complicated tax system and the over-regulated labor market , " he said . hans-jürgen walter , an adviser to capgemini germany , said the trend is likely to continue .
although assets are surging across the globe - such as in the us , where wealth is set to swell by 7.4 percent by 2010 , and asia , which is profiting from the rapidly climbing oil prices - the figure is expected to average a mere 3.7 percent a year in europe . küssner from merrill lynch said it 's hard to win market shares in germany and added that he predicts a growing trend among german property administrators to international co-operations . germa n y 's cha n gi n g fortu n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor konrad adenauer and economic minister ludwig erhard ushered in the economic miracle it 's a sharp contrast to the 1950s and 60s , when germany regularly topped the millionaire lists thanks to its famed economic miracle and the abundance of inherited property .
over the decades , this property was rented and the income invested .
after german reunification , the number of property owners climbed again - but by then , the us and japan had already caught up . in the meantime , financial services have had to adjust to what 's been described as the largest capital transfer in history , with more and more german money being transferred abroad , primarily to destinations such as hong kong , singapore and switzerland . according to the federal statistics office , most of the country 's financial elite that actually make more than $ 1 million per year , are based in north rhine-westphalia .
the western state is home to 3,000 high earners - more , even , than the notoriously affluent states of bavaria and baden württemberg . more localized still , the most prosperous corner of the country is the town of meerbusch near düsseldorf , where 61 of the 55,000 inhabitants earn a million and more per year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's richest dw-world.de 's look at germany 's richest people allows a peek into a world of money , power and influence accessible to a very few .

" that was incredible , " said rodriguez .
" it was a really tough game , with mexico making it very difficult for us but we came through in the end , " said rodriguez , who raced ecstatically to his bench to be embraced .
" now we are confident we can go further and beat anyone . " argentine coach jose pekerman said his side had taken their chance when it belatedly came . " it 's vital to take the chance when it arrives in as well-balanced a meeting as that between two rivals who know each other so well .
and we did - deservedly so , " pekerman said . " a magnificent game " mexico captain marquez ended this world cup as he had the last going out in the second round even if personally it was a happier ending than his red card against the united states in 2002 . however the barcelona defender was not too happy with the referee massimo busacca of switzerland . " various refereeing decisions went against us - but in the end the team that scores more goals wins .
we gave our all and it 's sad , " said the 27-year-old . " it was an even game , just as i expected it to be , and it was a magnificent individual goal that decided it , " said mexico coach lavolpe , himself a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad . " having said that , mexico gave an excellent account of themselves .
once again though , we did n't achieve what we came to do , which was to reach the quarter-finals at least . " mexico have twice been quarter-finalists , but on both occasions , in 1970 and 1986 , it was on home ground . they certainly had not shown any form in the group stages , scraping through with the 3-1 win over iran , an unconvincing 0-0 draw with angola and a 2-1 loss to group winners portugal . germany will prove a tough obstacle for the argentines as they looked an outstanding unit in the first-half demolishing a previously highly-regarded swedish defensive unit . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : argentina 6:0 serbia and montenegro argentina proved why some consider them a world cup title contender , displaying their speed and precision passing in a 6-0 rout of their group c opponents .

ecuador will hit hard and hope to snatch the victory . england 's players will know that they will have to sustain a 90-minute performance similar to their first half display against sweden in their final group b match if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals of the world cup at ecuador 's expense on sunday . after disappointing against paraguay and trinidad and tobago , sven goran eriksson 's team finally showed some cohesion in the first 45 minutes against the swedes with some positive attacking and crisp passing .
however , nerves and confusion set in after the restart and england were lucky to escape with the draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england will need all the support they can get england 's unnerving habit of falling apart after half-time will have to be curbed against south america 's surprise outfit who have shown that they can hit tentative teams at pace and score important goals against shaky defenses .
captain david beckham knows all about second-half collapses after suffering heartache against brazil at the 2002 world cup and portugal in euro 2004 . " there 's no excuses this time , " beckham said .
" in the past we 've gone out of competitions at stages when we should have gone further .
it 's up to us now - we 're the ones who can progress as a team . " a new england line-up ? the team that aims to avoid a similar defeat against ecuador in the first knock-out stage in stuttgart is likely to be a different one to that which snatched a draw from the teeth of victory in cologne last tuesday . right back gary neville is still out with a calf injury and central defender rio ferdinand is still a doubt .
eriksson is expected to shunt owen hargreaves , who had a good game against sweden in the holding midfield role , into the right back slot while sol campbell will deputize for ferdinand .
jamie carragher will be on the bench . michael carrick is expected to sit in front of the back four as the holding player in a 4-1-4-1 formation with joe cole and david beckham on the flanks and frank lampard and steve gerrard in the center .
wayne rooney is expected to play as a lone striker , meaning there is no starting place for peter crouch . with gerrard operating behind rooney at the tip of a midfield diamond , eriksson hopes the liverpool captain will provide the extra firepower now lacking after the injury to michael owen .
carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .
" what we have done is not all , " suarez said .
" there is more to come .
the world cup has not ended for ecuador . " " there is no reason for us to feel beaten before the match .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's on a roll ecuador looked impressive when beating poland 2-0 and costa rica 3-0 in their opening matches and suarez is confident his side can recover that form .
" the team are happy about what they 've done so far , " he said " we have already earned respect .
i hope we continue to make history . " ecuador 's midfield playmaker edison mendez is an injury doubt as he battles a leg muscle strain .
" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters . " he is undergoing tests and we do n't know if he will make it or not , " suarez added , explaining mendez , scorer of five goals in qualifying , had not made the training session and was having a scan . " if mendez does make it the line-up will be the same as in the first two matches , " suarez said , having sent out a second-string side for the final group a match against germany , which ended in a 3-0 defeat on the back of wins over poland and costa rica . in those two games , the south american minnows lined up with cristian mora in goal , aston villa 's ulises de la cruz , ivan hurtado , geovanny espinoza and neicer reasco at the back , luis valencia , segundo castillo , edwin tenorio and mendez in midfield and former southampton man agustin delgado and carlos tenorio in attack .

the netherlands are confident they can break a 15-year hex and avenge their euro 2004 semi-final defeat by sending portugal crashing out of the world cup on sunday . the dutch have not beaten portugal since 1991 but marco van basten 's remodeled team believe destiny is on their side ahead of the second-round clash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch are hoping they 'll be able to lift a 15-year curse " portugal beat us two years ago , but the next game is something completely different .
this is a new , young team , and we have new ideas , " said striker ruud van nistelrooy . two years ago , goals from cristiano ronaldo and maniche broke dutch hearts on a frenetic night in lisbon .
previously , portugal wrecked the netherlands ' 2002 world cup qualifying campaign with an away win and home draw . but the netherlands have not lost a competitive match since that semi-final after van basten took over from dick advocaat . " now , up against portugal , we have to forget about the trauma of euro 2004 , " said defensive midfield general phillip cocu .
" do n't look at the past , but only think about playing a good match . " formidable task the netherlands will be under no illusions about the size of the task , with world cup-winning coach scolari masterminding a portuguese record of 17 matches unbeaten . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch will be watching out for portugal 's cristiano ronaldo but despite portugal 's quality , and scolari 's unmatched world cup pedigree , van basten remains quietly confident .
" now we 're up against portugal .
we know they 're excellent but we 're also not bad , " he said .
" preparations will not change .
if we 're lucky , we 've got four finals to go , matches where you can make no errors because you can not go back on them . " van basten can turn to giovanni van bronckhorst and arjen robben , who were rested for the final group match with argentina . the former dutch great may also bench van nistelrooy in favor of feyenoord marksman dirk kuyt after aiming criticism at the manchester united man .
" ruud has not been good .
he has n't been on form in the first matches , " van basten said .
" he has to give us a lot more . " goalkeeper edwin van der sar is expected to win his 113th cap , beating frank de boer 's dutch record . portugal on target scolari meanwhile goes into the game on a record 10-match world cup winning streak , including seven as he led his native brazil to the title in 2002 . wins against angola , iran and mexico saw portugal through group d with maximum points and minimum fuss , with the brazilian even able to rest five first-team players for the final match . lisbon scorers ronaldo and maniche were both on target in the first round as portugal reached the knock-out stages for the first time since 1966 . " it 's only the second time portugal has qualified for the second round in 40 years but we have to look at it game by game , " scolari said .
" all the teams are very balanced and very even , they 're in good condition .
there are five or six teams which i believe are the best , they might be playing very well but one day they can have an off-day and be eliminated .

along the way , portugal beat holland 1-0 .
but the story of four players off and eight others booked will make all the headlines . portugal booked a world cup quarter-final with england on sunday with an ill-tempered 1-0 win over the netherlands in which both teams had two players sent off . russian referee valentin ivanov brandished a record 20 cards in total - 16 of them yellow - as portugal scraped through to extend coach luiz felipe scolari 's record world cup winning streak to 11 matches . ugly scenes marred the match as first costinha , then khalid boulahrouz , then deco and finally giovanni van bronckhorst saw red . portugal went 1-0 up after 23 minutes but put themselves in trouble when costinha received his second yellow just before half-time . early offenses set the tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce lee would have been proud they also lost cristiano ronaldo to a right thigh injury .

new details on the type of research roberto baggio and stuart pearce would have loved could be available for players lining up from the spot now that the 2006 cup has reached the knock-out stage . there are a number of ways sports physicists and psychologists say they can enhance the chances of players on either side of the ball . what the scientists say one of them is in training keepers in body language .
goalies who are alert to the kicker 's eyes , body posture and angle of his feet in the approach can gain as much as half a second to move in the right direction . scientists at john moores university in liverpool showed goalkeepers life-sized video footage of penalties being taken , filmed from the viewpoint of a keeper standing in the center of the goal . the film was stopped four times during the sequence - 120 milliseconds before the kick ; 40 milliseconds before ; at the point of impact ; and 40 milliseconds after - and the goalkeepers were asked at each stage to predict where the ball was going to be shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , considered to be the best in the world researchers found that the biggest clue was the position of the striker 's hips just before the strike . " if the taker 's hips are square-on to the goalkeeper in a right-footed kicker , the penalty goes to the right-hand side of the keeper , " the university 's mark williams said .
" if his hips are more ' open , ' or angled away from the goalkeeper , the kick tends to go to the left of the keeper . " research is two-sided but there are some shots that just ca n't be saved .
a study in biomechanics carried out at the university of bath in 2004 determined the maximum reach of a goalie 's dive , regardless of his size . it showed that , if the keeper stays on his line in accordance with the rules - which only the most inexperienced keepers bother with - 28 percent of the goal is an " unsaveable zone " that guarantees a score , provided the ball is kicked accurately and with reasonable force . but if you have to choose between placement and force , research shows blasting the ball to be the way to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hit your penalties as hard as possible " " hit your penalties as hard as possible , " kassam advised .
" research indicates that a penalty struck at more than 20 meters per second -lrb- 73 kilometers , 46 miles per hour -rrb- stands a greater chance of hitting the back of the net than a slower one , as a goalkeeper has less time to analyze visual clues and react . " according to fifa statistics , the kicker holds all the cards .
in the history of the tournament , 182 penalties have been awarded with 147 converted or 81 percent .
thirty-five have been missed with 22 of those blocked by the keeper . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

england 's creative midfield confined itself to long balls aimed at striker wayne rooney , while ecuador waited for a mistake by their opponents . they got it in the tenth minute .
defender john terry badly misjudged the ball , leaving ecuador striker carlos tenorio seemingly alone in front of the goal .
but defender ashley cole managed to get a leg in to deflect tenorio 's shot wide . that was it for early goal chances .
aside from a couple of david beckham free kicks , the lions were toothless , and the first half ended in a goalless draw . the second half started in equally languid fashion , with both teams looking as though they 'd rather be at the pool .
extra time and penalties seemed inevitable . then england 's captain came up trumps .
after an hour of play , david beckham curled one of his patented free-kicks past ecuadoran keeper cristian mora and into the lower left-hand corner to put the english up 1-0 .
beckham 's heroic shot is sure to silence critics at home who had called for him to be removed from the starting eleven . ecuador , while solid in defense , could n't manufacture any chances up front - especially as their top striker carlos tenorio had to be taken out with an ankle injury in the 70th minute . england ran down the clock to get a crucial win in a tepid match and keep alive their bid for their first world cup title in forty years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : england 1:0 ecuador review all the action as it happened with dw-world.de 's live ticker .

integration problems are n't as common in finland as in germany , but foreigners make up only 2 percent of the population , while in germany the proportion is four times greater . parallel paths to success economically speaking , finland stands for nokia - or maybe it 's the other way around .

energy policy is one of the top priorities . after the catastrophe in chernobyl , the energy company tvo built the first european nuclear power plant in western finland .
" olkiluoto 3 " is supposed to be the most secure atomic reactor ever made , but the risk remains . " our experience with atomic energy has been positive , " said paavo lipponen , a former premier and the current president of finland 's parliament .
energy is produced in massive quantities , but none of it is greenhouse gas .
and as far as " green power " is concerned , need will exceed supply in the future , lipponen said . importantly , nuclear energy is not dependent on petroleum or natural gas from russia .
the relationship between the eu and russia will be another major issue during the finnish presidency .
finns are still skeptical of their big neighbor to the east .

press officer cita högnabba had lots of good things to report about her country .

spider-leg candies , monster cookies and blood juice are also on offer .
the finnish rock band lordi had just won the eurovision song contest . " we sent the monsters and europe voted for them , " said cita högnabba , press and culture officer for the finnish government .
högnabba was about to give a presentation about her homeland in the embassy .
she did n't want to do be a propagandist .
but she really did n't have to . a + for fi n n ish schools since a study conducted by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- recognized finland as having the world 's best schools , germans have been more interested in learning about the country of saunas and lakes .

children with language difficulties are given special attention .
integration problems are n't as common in finland as in germany , but foreigners make up only 2 percent of the population , while in germany the proportion is four times greater . parallel paths to success economically speaking , finland stands for nokia - or maybe it 's the other way around .
the rise of the world 's largest cell phone company was nearly simultaneous with finland 's ascent from post-iron curtain nadirs .
with jorma ollila as ceo and an emphasis on mobile phones , nokia landed on the path to success in 1992 .
the value of the company 's stock has grown by more than 400 percent since then . the national success story began with eu accession in 1995 .
according to transparency international , there is practically zero corruption in finland today .
productivity , economic growth and price stability are above average compared with the 15 older european union member states .
the public sector enjoys a surplus .

unemployment rose from 3.5 percent to 18 percent and the gross domestic product sank by 27 percent . " finland did n't have time to lose , " högnabba said .
" the difficult situation forced the society to make difficult decisions . " social spending was cut severely .

that 's when finland will begin chairing the council of europe for six months .
energy policy is one of the top priorities . after the catastrophe in chernobyl , the energy company tvo built the first european nuclear power plant in western finland .
" olkiluoto 3 " is supposed to be the most secure atomic reactor ever made , but the risk remains . " our experience with atomic energy has been positive , " said paavo lipponen , a former premier and the current president of finland 's parliament .
energy is produced in massive quantities , but none of it is greenhouse gas .
and as far as " green power " is concerned , need will exceed supply in the future , lipponen said . importantly , nuclear energy is not dependent on petroleum or natural gas from russia .
the relationship between the eu and russia will be another major issue during the finnish presidency .
finns are still skeptical of their big neighbor to the east .
surveys have revealed that the five million nordic residents are also among the biggest skeptics of the european union , where finns tend to feel underrepresented .
however , distrust of russia runs even deeper : finland was a russian province until 1917 . fu n ctio n al a n d elega n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the finnish eu council presidency and today ?

but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty as well as save one . save a goal in a penalty shoot-out and you win stardom , miss and you may be turned back at the border on the way home .
in a split-second moment , you 're either hero or villain . but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty .
new details on the type of research roberto baggio and stuart pearce would have loved could be available for players lining up from the spot now that the 2006 cup has reached the knock-out stage . there are a number of ways sports physicists and psychologists say they can enhance the chances of players on either side of the ball . what the scientists say one of them is in training keepers in body language .
goalies who are alert to the kicker 's eyes , body posture and angle of his feet in the approach can gain as much as half a second to move in the right direction . scientists at john moores university in liverpool showed goalkeepers life-sized video footage of penalties being taken , filmed from the viewpoint of a keeper standing in the center of the goal . the film was stopped four times during the sequence - 120 milliseconds before the kick ; 40 milliseconds before ; at the point of impact ; and 40 milliseconds after - and the goalkeepers were asked at each stage to predict where the ball was going to be shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , considered to be the best in the world researchers found that the biggest clue was the position of the striker 's hips just before the strike . " if the taker 's hips are square-on to the goalkeeper in a right-footed kicker , the penalty goes to the right-hand side of the keeper , " the university 's mark williams said .
" if his hips are more ' open , ' or angled away from the goalkeeper , the kick tends to go to the left of the keeper . " research is two-sided but there are some shots that just ca n't be saved .
a study in biomechanics carried out at the university of bath in 2004 determined the maximum reach of a goalie 's dive , regardless of his size . it showed that , if the keeper stays on his line in accordance with the rules - which only the most inexperienced keepers bother with - 28 percent of the goal is an " unsaveable zone " that guarantees a score , provided the ball is kicked accurately and with reasonable force . but if you have to choose between placement and force , research shows blasting the ball to be the way to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hit your penalties as hard as possible " " hit your penalties as hard as possible , " kassam advised .
" research indicates that a penalty struck at more than 20 meters per second -lrb- 73 kilometers , 46 miles per hour -rrb- stands a greater chance of hitting the back of the net than a slower one , as a goalkeeper has less time to analyze visual clues and react . " according to fifa statistics , the kicker holds all the cards .
in the history of the tournament , 182 penalties have been awarded with 147 converted or 81 percent .
thirty-five have been missed with 22 of those blocked by the keeper . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

ecuador will hit hard and hope to snatch the victory . england 's players will know that they will have to sustain a 90-minute performance similar to their first half display against sweden in their final group b match if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals of the world cup at ecuador 's expense on sunday . after disappointing against paraguay and trinidad and tobago , sven goran eriksson 's team finally showed some cohesion in the first 45 minutes against the swedes with some positive attacking and crisp passing .
however , nerves and confusion set in after the restart and england were lucky to escape with the draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england will need all the support they can get england 's unnerving habit of falling apart after half-time will have to be curbed against south america 's surprise outfit who have shown that they can hit tentative teams at pace and score important goals against shaky defenses .
captain david beckham knows all about second-half collapses after suffering heartache against brazil at the 2002 world cup and portugal in euro 2004 . " there 's no excuses this time , " beckham said .
" in the past we 've gone out of competitions at stages when we should have gone further .
it 's up to us now - we 're the ones who can progress as a team . " a new england line-up ? the team that aims to avoid a similar defeat against ecuador in the first knock-out stage in stuttgart is likely to be a different one to that which snatched a draw from the teeth of victory in cologne last tuesday . right back gary neville is still out with a calf injury and central defender rio ferdinand is still a doubt .
eriksson is expected to shunt owen hargreaves , who had a good game against sweden in the holding midfield role , into the right back slot while sol campbell will deputize for ferdinand .
jamie carragher will be on the bench . michael carrick is expected to sit in front of the back four as the holding player in a 4-1-4-1 formation with joe cole and david beckham on the flanks and frank lampard and steve gerrard in the center .
wayne rooney is expected to play as a lone striker , meaning there is no starting place for peter crouch . with gerrard operating behind rooney at the tip of a midfield diamond , eriksson hopes the liverpool captain will provide the extra firepower now lacking after the injury to michael owen .
carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .
" what we have done is not all , " suarez said .
" there is more to come .
the world cup has not ended for ecuador . " " there is no reason for us to feel beaten before the match .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's on a roll ecuador looked impressive when beating poland 2-0 and costa rica 3-0 in their opening matches and suarez is confident his side can recover that form .
" the team are happy about what they 've done so far , " he said " we have already earned respect .
i hope we continue to make history . " ecuador 's midfield playmaker edison mendez is an injury doubt as he battles a leg muscle strain .
" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters . " he is undergoing tests and we do n't know if he will make it or not , " suarez added , explaining mendez , scorer of five goals in qualifying , had not made the training session and was having a scan . " if mendez does make it the line-up will be the same as in the first two matches , " suarez said , having sent out a second-string side for the final group a match against germany , which ended in a 3-0 defeat on the back of wins over poland and costa rica . in those two games , the south american minnows lined up with cristian mora in goal , aston villa 's ulises de la cruz , ivan hurtado , geovanny espinoza and neicer reasco at the back , luis valencia , segundo castillo , edwin tenorio and mendez in midfield and former southampton man agustin delgado and carlos tenorio in attack .

the netherlands are confident they can break a 15-year hex and avenge their euro 2004 semi-final defeat by sending portugal crashing out of the world cup on sunday . the dutch have not beaten portugal since 1991 but marco van basten 's remodeled team believe destiny is on their side ahead of the second-round clash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch are hoping they 'll be able to lift a 15-year curse " portugal beat us two years ago , but the next game is something completely different .
this is a new , young team , and we have new ideas , " said striker ruud van nistelrooy . two years ago , goals from cristiano ronaldo and maniche broke dutch hearts on a frenetic night in lisbon .
previously , portugal wrecked the netherlands ' 2002 world cup qualifying campaign with an away win and home draw . but the netherlands have not lost a competitive match since that semi-final after van basten took over from dick advocaat . " now , up against portugal , we have to forget about the trauma of euro 2004 , " said defensive midfield general phillip cocu .
" do n't look at the past , but only think about playing a good match . " formidable task the netherlands will be under no illusions about the size of the task , with world cup-winning coach scolari masterminding a portuguese record of 17 matches unbeaten . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch will be watching out for portugal 's cristiano ronaldo but despite portugal 's quality , and scolari 's unmatched world cup pedigree , van basten remains quietly confident .
" now we 're up against portugal .
we know they 're excellent but we 're also not bad , " he said .
" preparations will not change .
if we 're lucky , we 've got four finals to go , matches where you can make no errors because you can not go back on them . " van basten can turn to giovanni van bronckhorst and arjen robben , who were rested for the final group match with argentina . the former dutch great may also bench van nistelrooy in favor of feyenoord marksman dirk kuyt after aiming criticism at the manchester united man .
" ruud has not been good .
he has n't been on form in the first matches , " van basten said .
" he has to give us a lot more . " goalkeeper edwin van der sar is expected to win his 113th cap , beating frank de boer 's dutch record . portugal on target scolari meanwhile goes into the game on a record 10-match world cup winning streak , including seven as he led his native brazil to the title in 2002 . wins against angola , iran and mexico saw portugal through group d with maximum points and minimum fuss , with the brazilian even able to rest five first-team players for the final match . lisbon scorers ronaldo and maniche were both on target in the first round as portugal reached the knock-out stages for the first time since 1966 . " it 's only the second time portugal has qualified for the second round in 40 years but we have to look at it game by game , " scolari said .
" all the teams are very balanced and very even , they 're in good condition .
there are five or six teams which i believe are the best , they might be playing very well but one day they can have an off-day and be eliminated . " portugal will welcome back ronaldo , deco , pauleta and nuno valente , who were all stood down against mexico as a precaution against them getting a second yellow card . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch victory breaks hearts in ivory coast with everything at stake in the " group of death , " the ivory coast gave the holland a run for their money throughout a pulsating match that saw seven yellow cards before ending 2-1 in the netherlands ' favor .

england 's creative midfield confined itself to long balls aimed at striker wayne rooney , while ecuador waited for a mistake by their opponents . they got it in the tenth minute .
defender john terry badly misjudged the ball , leaving ecuador striker carlos tenorio seemingly alone in front of the goal .
but defender ashley cole managed to get a leg in to deflect tenorio 's shot wide . that was it for early goal chances .
aside from a couple of david beckham free kicks , the lions were toothless , and the first half ended in a goalless draw . the second half started in equally languid fashion , with both teams looking as though they 'd rather be at the pool .
extra time and penalties seemed inevitable . then england 's captain came up trumps .
after an hour of play , david beckham curled one of his patented free-kicks past ecuadoran keeper cristian mora and into the lower left-hand corner to put the english up 1-0 .
beckham 's heroic shot is sure to silence critics at home who had called for him to be removed from the starting eleven . ecuador , while solid in defense , could n't manufacture any chances up front - especially as their top striker carlos tenorio had to be taken out with an ankle injury in the 70th minute . england ran down the clock to get a crucial win in a tepid match and keep alive their bid for their first world cup title in forty years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : england 1:0 ecuador review all the action as it happened with dw-world.de 's live ticker .

press officer cita högnabba had lots of good things to report about her country .
but is it really such a wonderland ? on a wednesday last year , the italian ambassador dropped by the finnish foreign ministry in helsinki .
ugo gabriele de mohr had to apologize for then italian premier silvio berlusconi 's statement that finnish food was abominable . one year later , during a coffee break at the nordic embassies in berlin .
spider-leg candies , monster cookies and blood juice are also on offer .
the finnish rock band lordi had just won the eurovision song contest . " we sent the monsters and europe voted for them , " said cita högnabba , press and culture officer for the finnish government .
högnabba was about to give a presentation about her homeland in the embassy .
she did n't want to do be a propagandist .
but she really did n't have to . a + for fi n n ish schools since a study conducted by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- recognized finland as having the world 's best schools , germans have been more interested in learning about the country of saunas and lakes .
högnabba shows politicians and journalists around the schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masked monsters of lordi took the prize at this year 's eurovision song contest " it 's crucial that everyone gets a good basic education , " said the 49-year-old .
" we did away with the dead-end schools 40 years ago . " students in finland stay in one class until the ninth grade and receive a warm lunch every day .
children with language difficulties are given special attention .
integration problems are n't as common in finland as in germany , but foreigners make up only 2 percent of the population , while in germany the proportion is four times greater . parallel paths to success economically speaking , finland stands for nokia - or maybe it 's the other way around .
the rise of the world 's largest cell phone company was nearly simultaneous with finland 's ascent from post-iron curtain nadirs .
with jorma ollila as ceo and an emphasis on mobile phones , nokia landed on the path to success in 1992 .
the value of the company 's stock has grown by more than 400 percent since then . the national success story began with eu accession in 1995 .
according to transparency international , there is practically zero corruption in finland today .
productivity , economic growth and price stability are above average compared with the 15 older european union member states .
the public sector enjoys a surplus .
and the world economic forum has listed finland as the most competitive country in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's eonomic growth paralleled nokia 's upward climb in the mid 1990s " all that is the result of extensive reforms during the 1990s , " högnabba said . with the collapse of the soviet union , finland lost its most important trading partner and fell into a deep recession .
unemployment rose from 3.5 percent to 18 percent and the gross domestic product sank by 27 percent . " finland did n't have time to lose , " högnabba said .
" the difficult situation forced the society to make difficult decisions . " social spending was cut severely .
the crisis passed .
and finland became a role model country . gree n e n ergy a n d relatio n s with russia the inquiries will start piling up in högnabba 's mailbox on july 1 .
that 's when finland will begin chairing the council of europe for six months .
energy policy is one of the top priorities . after the catastrophe in chernobyl , the energy company tvo built the first european nuclear power plant in western finland .
" olkiluoto 3 " is supposed to be the most secure atomic reactor ever made , but the risk remains . " our experience with atomic energy has been positive , " said paavo lipponen , a former premier and the current president of finland 's parliament .
energy is produced in massive quantities , but none of it is greenhouse gas .
and as far as " green power " is concerned , need will exceed supply in the future , lipponen said . importantly , nuclear energy is not dependent on petroleum or natural gas from russia .
the relationship between the eu and russia will be another major issue during the finnish presidency .
finns are still skeptical of their big neighbor to the east .
surveys have revealed that the five million nordic residents are also among the biggest skeptics of the european union , where finns tend to feel underrepresented .
however , distrust of russia runs even deeper : finland was a russian province until 1917 . fu n ctio n al a n d elega n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the finnish eu council presidency and today ? " there 's no such thing as wonderland , " högnabba said .
" but finland has properly dealt with issues at many levels . " like many industrial nations , it faces the problem of an aging society .
there are already labor shortages in some sectors .
and , despite cuts in the past few years , taxes are still among the highest in the world . " but we also get something for it , " högnabba said . prime minister matti vanhanen on wednesday presented his plans for the european council presidency in parliament in helsinki .
one important point appeared early on the official web site of the future european council president . " finnish cuisine will play a key role in the catering , " it read .
" center pieces on the tables will be simple , but functional and elegant . " " italian cuisine is certainly better known , " högnabba said .
" but we see that as a challenge . " a challenge similar to this year 's eurovision song contest and , in the future , to soccer : after all , finland has yet to qualify for a final round of the world cup . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .
-lrb- april 6 , 2006 -rrb- finnish monster rockers conquer eurovision finnish heavy metal band lordi kept their promise to " bring rock to eurovision " , handing their country its first title in the annual song contest 's 51-year history with an explosive victory in athens early sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2006 the nordic wonderland of saunas , lakes and cell phones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely landscapes are only the beginning of what finland has to offer finland takes on the european council presidency in july and announced its plans wednesday .
press officer cita högnabba had lots of good things to report about her country .
but is it really such a wonderland ? on a wednesday last year , the italian ambassador dropped by the finnish foreign ministry in helsinki .
ugo gabriele de mohr had to apologize for then italian premier silvio berlusconi 's statement that finnish food was abominable . one year later , during a coffee break at the nordic embassies in berlin .
spider-leg candies , monster cookies and blood juice are also on offer .
the finnish rock band lordi had just won the eurovision song contest . " we sent the monsters and europe voted for them , " said cita högnabba , press and culture officer for the finnish government .
högnabba was about to give a presentation about her homeland in the embassy .
she did n't want to do be a propagandist .
but she really did n't have to . a + for fi n n ish schools since a study conducted by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- recognized finland as having the world 's best schools , germans have been more interested in learning about the country of saunas and lakes .
högnabba shows politicians and journalists around the schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masked monsters of lordi took the prize at this year 's eurovision song contest " it 's crucial that everyone gets a good basic education , " said the 49-year-old .
" we did away with the dead-end schools 40 years ago . " students in finland stay in one class until the ninth grade and receive a warm lunch every day .
children with language difficulties are given special attention .
integration problems are n't as common in finland as in germany , but foreigners make up only 2 percent of the population , while in germany the proportion is four times greater . parallel paths to success economically speaking , finland stands for nokia - or maybe it 's the other way around .
the rise of the world 's largest cell phone company was nearly simultaneous with finland 's ascent from post-iron curtain nadirs .
with jorma ollila as ceo and an emphasis on mobile phones , nokia landed on the path to success in 1992 .
the value of the company 's stock has grown by more than 400 percent since then . the national success story began with eu accession in 1995 .
according to transparency international , there is practically zero corruption in finland today .
productivity , economic growth and price stability are above average compared with the 15 older european union member states .
the public sector enjoys a surplus .
and the world economic forum has listed finland as the most competitive country in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's eonomic growth paralleled nokia 's upward climb in the mid 1990s " all that is the result of extensive reforms during the 1990s , " högnabba said . with the collapse of the soviet union , finland lost its most important trading partner and fell into a deep recession .
unemployment rose from 3.5 percent to 18 percent and the gross domestic product sank by 27 percent . " finland did n't have time to lose , " högnabba said .
" the difficult situation forced the society to make difficult decisions . " social spending was cut severely .
the crisis passed .
and finland became a role model country . gree n e n ergy a n d relatio n s with russia the inquiries will start piling up in högnabba 's mailbox on july 1 .
that 's when finland will begin chairing the council of europe for six months .
energy policy is one of the top priorities . after the catastrophe in chernobyl , the energy company tvo built the first european nuclear power plant in western finland .
" olkiluoto 3 " is supposed to be the most secure atomic reactor ever made , but the risk remains . " our experience with atomic energy has been positive , " said paavo lipponen , a former premier and the current president of finland 's parliament .
energy is produced in massive quantities , but none of it is greenhouse gas .
and as far as " green power " is concerned , need will exceed supply in the future , lipponen said . importantly , nuclear energy is not dependent on petroleum or natural gas from russia .
the relationship between the eu and russia will be another major issue during the finnish presidency .
finns are still skeptical of their big neighbor to the east .
surveys have revealed that the five million nordic residents are also among the biggest skeptics of the european union , where finns tend to feel underrepresented .
however , distrust of russia runs even deeper : finland was a russian province until 1917 . fu n ctio n al a n d elega n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the finnish eu council presidency and today ? " there 's no such thing as wonderland , " högnabba said .
" but finland has properly dealt with issues at many levels . " like many industrial nations , it faces the problem of an aging society .
there are already labor shortages in some sectors .
and , despite cuts in the past few years , taxes are still among the highest in the world . " but we also get something for it , " högnabba said . prime minister matti vanhanen on wednesday presented his plans for the european council presidency in parliament in helsinki .
one important point appeared early on the official web site of the future european council president . " finnish cuisine will play a key role in the catering , " it read .
" center pieces on the tables will be simple , but functional and elegant . " " italian cuisine is certainly better known , " högnabba said .
" but we see that as a challenge . " a challenge similar to this year 's eurovision song contest and , in the future , to soccer : after all , finland has yet to qualify for a final round of the world cup . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .

along the way , portugal beat holland 1-0 .
but the story of four players off and eight others booked will make all the headlines . portugal booked a world cup quarter-final with england on sunday with an ill-tempered 1-0 win over the netherlands in which both teams had two players sent off . russian referee valentin ivanov brandished a record 20 cards in total - 16 of them yellow - as portugal scraped through to extend coach luiz felipe scolari 's record world cup winning streak to 11 matches . ugly scenes marred the match as first costinha , then khalid boulahrouz , then deco and finally giovanni van bronckhorst saw red . portugal went 1-0 up after 23 minutes but put themselves in trouble when costinha received his second yellow just before half-time . early offenses set the tone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruce lee would have been proud they also lost cristiano ronaldo to a right thigh injury .

ecuador will hit hard and hope to snatch the victory . england 's players will know that they will have to sustain a 90-minute performance similar to their first half display against sweden in their final group b match if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals of the world cup at ecuador 's expense on sunday . after disappointing against paraguay and trinidad and tobago , sven goran eriksson 's team finally showed some cohesion in the first 45 minutes against the swedes with some positive attacking and crisp passing .
however , nerves and confusion set in after the restart and england were lucky to escape with the draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england will need all the support they can get england 's unnerving habit of falling apart after half-time will have to be curbed against south america 's surprise outfit who have shown that they can hit tentative teams at pace and score important goals against shaky defenses .
captain david beckham knows all about second-half collapses after suffering heartache against brazil at the 2002 world cup and portugal in euro 2004 . " there 's no excuses this time , " beckham said .
" in the past we 've gone out of competitions at stages when we should have gone further .
it 's up to us now - we 're the ones who can progress as a team . " a new england line-up ? the team that aims to avoid a similar defeat against ecuador in the first knock-out stage in stuttgart is likely to be a different one to that which snatched a draw from the teeth of victory in cologne last tuesday . right back gary neville is still out with a calf injury and central defender rio ferdinand is still a doubt .
eriksson is expected to shunt owen hargreaves , who had a good game against sweden in the holding midfield role , into the right back slot while sol campbell will deputize for ferdinand .
jamie carragher will be on the bench . michael carrick is expected to sit in front of the back four as the holding player in a 4-1-4-1 formation with joe cole and david beckham on the flanks and frank lampard and steve gerrard in the center .
wayne rooney is expected to play as a lone striker , meaning there is no starting place for peter crouch . with gerrard operating behind rooney at the tip of a midfield diamond , eriksson hopes the liverpool captain will provide the extra firepower now lacking after the injury to michael owen .
carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .
" what we have done is not all , " suarez said .
" there is more to come .
the world cup has not ended for ecuador . " " there is no reason for us to feel beaten before the match .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's on a roll ecuador looked impressive when beating poland 2-0 and costa rica 3-0 in their opening matches and suarez is confident his side can recover that form .
" the team are happy about what they 've done so far , " he said " we have already earned respect .
i hope we continue to make history . " ecuador 's midfield playmaker edison mendez is an injury doubt as he battles a leg muscle strain .
" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters . " he is undergoing tests and we do n't know if he will make it or not , " suarez added , explaining mendez , scorer of five goals in qualifying , had not made the training session and was having a scan . " if mendez does make it the line-up will be the same as in the first two matches , " suarez said , having sent out a second-string side for the final group a match against germany , which ended in a 3-0 defeat on the back of wins over poland and costa rica . in those two games , the south american minnows lined up with cristian mora in goal , aston villa 's ulises de la cruz , ivan hurtado , geovanny espinoza and neicer reasco at the back , luis valencia , segundo castillo , edwin tenorio and mendez in midfield and former southampton man agustin delgado and carlos tenorio in attack .

carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .
" what we have done is not all , " suarez said .
" there is more to come .
the world cup has not ended for ecuador . " " there is no reason for us to feel beaten before the match .
if we are going to lose , let it be during the match , not before . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's on a roll ecuador looked impressive when beating poland 2-0 and costa rica 3-0 in their opening matches and suarez is confident his side can recover that form .
" the team are happy about what they 've done so far , " he said " we have already earned respect .
i hope we continue to make history . " ecuador 's midfield playmaker edison mendez is an injury doubt as he battles a leg muscle strain .
" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters . " he is undergoing tests and we do n't know if he will make it or not , " suarez added , explaining mendez , scorer of five goals in qualifying , had not made the training session and was having a scan . " if mendez does make it the line-up will be the same as in the first two matches , " suarez said , having sent out a second-string side for the final group a match against germany , which ended in a 3-0 defeat on the back of wins over poland and costa rica . in those two games , the south american minnows lined up with cristian mora in goal , aston villa 's ulises de la cruz , ivan hurtado , geovanny espinoza and neicer reasco at the back , luis valencia , segundo castillo , edwin tenorio and mendez in midfield and former southampton man agustin delgado and carlos tenorio in attack .

but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty as well as save one . save a goal in a penalty shoot-out and you win stardom , miss and you may be turned back at the border on the way home .
in a split-second moment , you 're either hero or villain . but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty .
new details on the type of research roberto baggio and stuart pearce would have loved could be available for players lining up from the spot now that the 2006 cup has reached the knock-out stage . there are a number of ways sports physicists and psychologists say they can enhance the chances of players on either side of the ball . what the scientists say one of them is in training keepers in body language .
goalies who are alert to the kicker 's eyes , body posture and angle of his feet in the approach can gain as much as half a second to move in the right direction . scientists at john moores university in liverpool showed goalkeepers life-sized video footage of penalties being taken , filmed from the viewpoint of a keeper standing in the center of the goal . the film was stopped four times during the sequence - 120 milliseconds before the kick ; 40 milliseconds before ; at the point of impact ; and 40 milliseconds after - and the goalkeepers were asked at each stage to predict where the ball was going to be shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , considered to be the best in the world researchers found that the biggest clue was the position of the striker 's hips just before the strike . " if the taker 's hips are square-on to the goalkeeper in a right-footed kicker , the penalty goes to the right-hand side of the keeper , " the university 's mark williams said .
" if his hips are more ' open , ' or angled away from the goalkeeper , the kick tends to go to the left of the keeper . " research is two-sided but there are some shots that just ca n't be saved .
a study in biomechanics carried out at the university of bath in 2004 determined the maximum reach of a goalie 's dive , regardless of his size . it showed that , if the keeper stays on his line in accordance with the rules - which only the most inexperienced keepers bother with - 28 percent of the goal is an " unsaveable zone " that guarantees a score , provided the ball is kicked accurately and with reasonable force . but if you have to choose between placement and force , research shows blasting the ball to be the way to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hit your penalties as hard as possible " " hit your penalties as hard as possible , " kassam advised .
" research indicates that a penalty struck at more than 20 meters per second -lrb- 73 kilometers , 46 miles per hour -rrb- stands a greater chance of hitting the back of the net than a slower one , as a goalkeeper has less time to analyze visual clues and react . " according to fifa statistics , the kicker holds all the cards .
in the history of the tournament , 182 penalties have been awarded with 147 converted or 81 percent .
thirty-five have been missed with 22 of those blocked by the keeper . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2006 the nordic wonderland of saunas , lakes and cell phones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovely landscapes are only the beginning of what finland has to offer finland takes on the european council presidency in july and announced its plans wednesday .
press officer cita högnabba had lots of good things to report about her country .
but is it really such a wonderland ? on a wednesday last year , the italian ambassador dropped by the finnish foreign ministry in helsinki .
ugo gabriele de mohr had to apologize for then italian premier silvio berlusconi 's statement that finnish food was abominable . one year later , during a coffee break at the nordic embassies in berlin .
spider-leg candies , monster cookies and blood juice are also on offer .
the finnish rock band lordi had just won the eurovision song contest . " we sent the monsters and europe voted for them , " said cita högnabba , press and culture officer for the finnish government .
högnabba was about to give a presentation about her homeland in the embassy .
she did n't want to do be a propagandist .
but she really did n't have to . a + for fi n n ish schools since a study conducted by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- recognized finland as having the world 's best schools , germans have been more interested in learning about the country of saunas and lakes .
högnabba shows politicians and journalists around the schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masked monsters of lordi took the prize at this year 's eurovision song contest " it 's crucial that everyone gets a good basic education , " said the 49-year-old .
" we did away with the dead-end schools 40 years ago . " students in finland stay in one class until the ninth grade and receive a warm lunch every day .
children with language difficulties are given special attention .
integration problems are n't as common in finland as in germany , but foreigners make up only 2 percent of the population , while in germany the proportion is four times greater . parallel paths to success economically speaking , finland stands for nokia - or maybe it 's the other way around .
the rise of the world 's largest cell phone company was nearly simultaneous with finland 's ascent from post-iron curtain nadirs .
with jorma ollila as ceo and an emphasis on mobile phones , nokia landed on the path to success in 1992 .
the value of the company 's stock has grown by more than 400 percent since then . the national success story began with eu accession in 1995 .
according to transparency international , there is practically zero corruption in finland today .
productivity , economic growth and price stability are above average compared with the 15 older european union member states .
the public sector enjoys a surplus .
and the world economic forum has listed finland as the most competitive country in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finland 's eonomic growth paralleled nokia 's upward climb in the mid 1990s " all that is the result of extensive reforms during the 1990s , " högnabba said . with the collapse of the soviet union , finland lost its most important trading partner and fell into a deep recession .
unemployment rose from 3.5 percent to 18 percent and the gross domestic product sank by 27 percent . " finland did n't have time to lose , " högnabba said .
" the difficult situation forced the society to make difficult decisions . " social spending was cut severely .
the crisis passed .
and finland became a role model country . gree n e n ergy a n d relatio n s with russia the inquiries will start piling up in högnabba 's mailbox on july 1 .
that 's when finland will begin chairing the council of europe for six months .
energy policy is one of the top priorities . after the catastrophe in chernobyl , the energy company tvo built the first european nuclear power plant in western finland .
" olkiluoto 3 " is supposed to be the most secure atomic reactor ever made , but the risk remains . " our experience with atomic energy has been positive , " said paavo lipponen , a former premier and the current president of finland 's parliament .
energy is produced in massive quantities , but none of it is greenhouse gas .
and as far as " green power " is concerned , need will exceed supply in the future , lipponen said . importantly , nuclear energy is not dependent on petroleum or natural gas from russia .
the relationship between the eu and russia will be another major issue during the finnish presidency .
finns are still skeptical of their big neighbor to the east .
surveys have revealed that the five million nordic residents are also among the biggest skeptics of the european union , where finns tend to feel underrepresented .
however , distrust of russia runs even deeper : finland was a russian province until 1917 . fu n ctio n al a n d elega n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the finnish eu council presidency and today ? " there 's no such thing as wonderland , " högnabba said .
" but finland has properly dealt with issues at many levels . " like many industrial nations , it faces the problem of an aging society .
there are already labor shortages in some sectors .
and , despite cuts in the past few years , taxes are still among the highest in the world . " but we also get something for it , " högnabba said . prime minister matti vanhanen on wednesday presented his plans for the european council presidency in parliament in helsinki .
one important point appeared early on the official web site of the future european council president . " finnish cuisine will play a key role in the catering , " it read .
" center pieces on the tables will be simple , but functional and elegant . " " italian cuisine is certainly better known , " högnabba said .
" but we see that as a challenge . " a challenge similar to this year 's eurovision song contest and , in the future , to soccer : after all , finland has yet to qualify for a final round of the world cup . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .

slight as that might be , there are still more millionaires here than anywhere else in the world apart from the us and japan . the 10th world wealth report published by consultants capgemini and us investment bank merrill lynch revealed that in 2005 , germany was home to a total of 767,000 high net worth individuals -lrb- hnwi -rrb- - private investors with a fortune of over $ 1 million -lrb- 791,000 euros -rrb- or property worth an equal amount . the report has germany tailing the us , with its 2.6 million millionaires , and japan , with 1.4 million - while world-wide , the number of hnwis climbed 6.5 percent to a total of 8.7 million . hard to make mo n ey i n germa n y it seems that it 's harder to augment a fortune in germany than elsewhere on the planet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , noone was buying " like the year before , there were no new fortunes made in 2005 despite positive developments on the stock market and rising productivity , " achim küssner , german ceo of merrill lynch investment managers , told ha n delsblatt . " inhibiting factors included depressed consumer confidence caused by persistent unemployment and the low rise in wage costs ; the complicated tax system and the over-regulated labor market , " he said . hans-jürgen walter , an adviser to capgemini germany , said the trend is likely to continue .
although assets are surging across the globe - such as in the us , where wealth is set to swell by 7.4 percent by 2010 , and asia , which is profiting from the rapidly climbing oil prices - the figure is expected to average a mere 3.7 percent a year in europe . küssner from merrill lynch said it 's hard to win market shares in germany and added that he predicts a growing trend among german property administrators to international co-operations . germa n y 's cha n gi n g fortu n es bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor konrad adenauer and economic minister ludwig erhard ushered in the economic miracle it 's a sharp contrast to the 1950s and 60s , when germany regularly topped the millionaire lists thanks to its famed economic miracle and the abundance of inherited property .
over the decades , this property was rented and the income invested .
after german reunification , the number of property owners climbed again - but by then , the us and japan had already caught up . in the meantime , financial services have had to adjust to what 's been described as the largest capital transfer in history , with more and more german money being transferred abroad , primarily to destinations such as hong kong , singapore and switzerland . according to the federal statistics office , most of the country 's financial elite that actually make more than $ 1 million per year , are based in north rhine-westphalia .
the western state is home to 3,000 high earners - more , even , than the notoriously affluent states of bavaria and baden württemberg . more localized still , the most prosperous corner of the country is the town of meerbusch near düsseldorf , where 61 of the 55,000 inhabitants earn a million and more per year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's richest dw-world.de 's look at germany 's richest people allows a peek into a world of money , power and influence accessible to a very few .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 25.06.2006 england , ecuador game a test for nerves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador will try to thwart england 's dreams if england aim to make it to the quarter-finals , they need to demonstrate a stamina not seen so far in the tournament .
ecuador will hit hard and hope to snatch the victory . england 's players will know that they will have to sustain a 90-minute performance similar to their first half display against sweden in their final group b match if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals of the world cup at ecuador 's expense on sunday . after disappointing against paraguay and trinidad and tobago , sven goran eriksson 's team finally showed some cohesion in the first 45 minutes against the swedes with some positive attacking and crisp passing .
however , nerves and confusion set in after the restart and england were lucky to escape with the draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england will need all the support they can get england 's unnerving habit of falling apart after half-time will have to be curbed against south america 's surprise outfit who have shown that they can hit tentative teams at pace and score important goals against shaky defenses .
captain david beckham knows all about second-half collapses after suffering heartache against brazil at the 2002 world cup and portugal in euro 2004 . " there 's no excuses this time , " beckham said .
" in the past we 've gone out of competitions at stages when we should have gone further .
it 's up to us now - we 're the ones who can progress as a team . " a new england line-up ? the team that aims to avoid a similar defeat against ecuador in the first knock-out stage in stuttgart is likely to be a different one to that which snatched a draw from the teeth of victory in cologne last tuesday . right back gary neville is still out with a calf injury and central defender rio ferdinand is still a doubt .
eriksson is expected to shunt owen hargreaves , who had a good game against sweden in the holding midfield role , into the right back slot while sol campbell will deputize for ferdinand .
jamie carragher will be on the bench . michael carrick is expected to sit in front of the back four as the holding player in a 4-1-4-1 formation with joe cole and david beckham on the flanks and frank lampard and steve gerrard in the center .
wayne rooney is expected to play as a lone striker , meaning there is no starting place for peter crouch . with gerrard operating behind rooney at the tip of a midfield diamond , eriksson hopes the liverpool captain will provide the extra firepower now lacking after the injury to michael owen .
carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .
" what we have done is not all , " suarez said .
" there is more to come .
the world cup has not ended for ecuador . " " there is no reason for us to feel beaten before the match .
if we are going to lose , let it be during the match , not before . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's on a roll ecuador looked impressive when beating poland 2-0 and costa rica 3-0 in their opening matches and suarez is confident his side can recover that form .
" the team are happy about what they 've done so far , " he said " we have already earned respect .
i hope we continue to make history . " ecuador 's midfield playmaker edison mendez is an injury doubt as he battles a leg muscle strain .
" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters . " he is undergoing tests and we do n't know if he will make it or not , " suarez added , explaining mendez , scorer of five goals in qualifying , had not made the training session and was having a scan .

ecuador will hit hard and hope to snatch the victory . england 's players will know that they will have to sustain a 90-minute performance similar to their first half display against sweden in their final group b match if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals of the world cup at ecuador 's expense on sunday . after disappointing against paraguay and trinidad and tobago , sven goran eriksson 's team finally showed some cohesion in the first 45 minutes against the swedes with some positive attacking and crisp passing .
however , nerves and confusion set in after the restart and england were lucky to escape with the draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england will need all the support they can get england 's unnerving habit of falling apart after half-time will have to be curbed against south america 's surprise outfit who have shown that they can hit tentative teams at pace and score important goals against shaky defenses .
captain david beckham knows all about second-half collapses after suffering heartache against brazil at the 2002 world cup and portugal in euro 2004 . " there 's no excuses this time , " beckham said .
" in the past we 've gone out of competitions at stages when we should have gone further .
it 's up to us now - we 're the ones who can progress as a team . " a new england line-up ? the team that aims to avoid a similar defeat against ecuador in the first knock-out stage in stuttgart is likely to be a different one to that which snatched a draw from the teeth of victory in cologne last tuesday . right back gary neville is still out with a calf injury and central defender rio ferdinand is still a doubt .
eriksson is expected to shunt owen hargreaves , who had a good game against sweden in the holding midfield role , into the right back slot while sol campbell will deputize for ferdinand .
jamie carragher will be on the bench . michael carrick is expected to sit in front of the back four as the holding player in a 4-1-4-1 formation with joe cole and david beckham on the flanks and frank lampard and steve gerrard in the center .
wayne rooney is expected to play as a lone striker , meaning there is no starting place for peter crouch . with gerrard operating behind rooney at the tip of a midfield diamond , eriksson hopes the liverpool captain will provide the extra firepower now lacking after the injury to michael owen .
carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .
" what we have done is not all , " suarez said .
" there is more to come .
the world cup has not ended for ecuador . " " there is no reason for us to feel beaten before the match .
if we are going to lose , let it be during the match , not before . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's on a roll ecuador looked impressive when beating poland 2-0 and costa rica 3-0 in their opening matches and suarez is confident his side can recover that form .
" the team are happy about what they 've done so far , " he said " we have already earned respect .
i hope we continue to make history . " ecuador 's midfield playmaker edison mendez is an injury doubt as he battles a leg muscle strain .
" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters . " he is undergoing tests and we do n't know if he will make it or not , " suarez added , explaining mendez , scorer of five goals in qualifying , had not made the training session and was having a scan . " if mendez does make it the line-up will be the same as in the first two matches , " suarez said , having sent out a second-string side for the final group a match against germany , which ended in a 3-0 defeat on the back of wins over poland and costa rica . in those two games , the south american minnows lined up with cristian mora in goal , aston villa 's ulises de la cruz , ivan hurtado , geovanny espinoza and neicer reasco at the back , luis valencia , segundo castillo , edwin tenorio and mendez in midfield and former southampton man agustin delgado and carlos tenorio in attack .

however , nerves and confusion set in after the restart and england were lucky to escape with the draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england will need all the support they can get england 's unnerving habit of falling apart after half-time will have to be curbed against south america 's surprise outfit who have shown that they can hit tentative teams at pace and score important goals against shaky defenses .
captain david beckham knows all about second-half collapses after suffering heartache against brazil at the 2002 world cup and portugal in euro 2004 . " there 's no excuses this time , " beckham said .
" in the past we 've gone out of competitions at stages when we should have gone further .
it 's up to us now - we 're the ones who can progress as a team . " a new england line-up ? the team that aims to avoid a similar defeat against ecuador in the first knock-out stage in stuttgart is likely to be a different one to that which snatched a draw from the teeth of victory in cologne last tuesday . right back gary neville is still out with a calf injury and central defender rio ferdinand is still a doubt .
eriksson is expected to shunt owen hargreaves , who had a good game against sweden in the holding midfield role , into the right back slot while sol campbell will deputize for ferdinand .
jamie carragher will be on the bench . michael carrick is expected to sit in front of the back four as the holding player in a 4-1-4-1 formation with joe cole and david beckham on the flanks and frank lampard and steve gerrard in the center .
wayne rooney is expected to play as a lone striker , meaning there is no starting place for peter crouch . with gerrard operating behind rooney at the tip of a midfield diamond , eriksson hopes the liverpool captain will provide the extra firepower now lacking after the injury to michael owen .
carrick - a cool headed playmaker - will be deployed as a calming influence and distributor for a defense with a penchant for the wobbles . ecuador goes for the long-stretch meanwhile , ecuador coach luis suarez insists that his team will not be intimidated by the prospect of tackling england .
" what we have done is not all , " suarez said .
" there is more to come .
the world cup has not ended for ecuador . " " there is no reason for us to feel beaten before the match .
if we are going to lose , let it be during the match , not before . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's on a roll ecuador looked impressive when beating poland 2-0 and costa rica 3-0 in their opening matches and suarez is confident his side can recover that form .
" the team are happy about what they 've done so far , " he said " we have already earned respect .
i hope we continue to make history . " ecuador 's midfield playmaker edison mendez is an injury doubt as he battles a leg muscle strain .
" the team is fine with the exception of edison mendez .
that 's the news , " suarez told a reporters friday following training at their bad kissingen headquarters . " he is undergoing tests and we do n't know if he will make it or not , " suarez added , explaining mendez , scorer of five goals in qualifying , had not made the training session and was having a scan . " if mendez does make it the line-up will be the same as in the first two matches , " suarez said , having sent out a second-string side for the final group a match against germany , which ended in a 3-0 defeat on the back of wins over poland and costa rica . in those two games , the south american minnows lined up with cristian mora in goal , aston villa 's ulises de la cruz , ivan hurtado , geovanny espinoza and neicer reasco at the back , luis valencia , segundo castillo , edwin tenorio and mendez in midfield and former southampton man agustin delgado and carlos tenorio in attack .

" that was incredible , " said rodriguez .
" it was a really tough game , with mexico making it very difficult for us but we came through in the end , " said rodriguez , who raced ecstatically to his bench to be embraced .
" now we are confident we can go further and beat anyone . " argentine coach jose pekerman said his side had taken their chance when it belatedly came . " it 's vital to take the chance when it arrives in as well-balanced a meeting as that between two rivals who know each other so well .
and we did - deservedly so , " pekerman said . " a magnificent game " mexico captain marquez ended this world cup as he had the last going out in the second round even if personally it was a happier ending than his red card against the united states in 2002 . however the barcelona defender was not too happy with the referee massimo busacca of switzerland . " various refereeing decisions went against us - but in the end the team that scores more goals wins .
we gave our all and it 's sad , " said the 27-year-old . " it was an even game , just as i expected it to be , and it was a magnificent individual goal that decided it , " said mexico coach lavolpe , himself a member of argentina 's 1978 world cup-winning squad . " having said that , mexico gave an excellent account of themselves .
once again though , we did n't achieve what we came to do , which was to reach the quarter-finals at least . " mexico have twice been quarter-finalists , but on both occasions , in 1970 and 1986 , it was on home ground . they certainly had not shown any form in the group stages , scraping through with the 3-1 win over iran , an unconvincing 0-0 draw with angola and a 2-1 loss to group winners portugal . germany will prove a tough obstacle for the argentines as they looked an outstanding unit in the first-half demolishing a previously highly-regarded swedish defensive unit . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : argentina 6:0 serbia and montenegro argentina proved why some consider them a world cup title contender , displaying their speed and precision passing in a 6-0 rout of their group c opponents .

but is it really such a wonderland ? on a wednesday last year , the italian ambassador dropped by the finnish foreign ministry in helsinki .
ugo gabriele de mohr had to apologize for then italian premier silvio berlusconi 's statement that finnish food was abominable . one year later , during a coffee break at the nordic embassies in berlin .
spider-leg candies , monster cookies and blood juice are also on offer .
the finnish rock band lordi had just won the eurovision song contest . " we sent the monsters and europe voted for them , " said cita högnabba , press and culture officer for the finnish government .
högnabba was about to give a presentation about her homeland in the embassy .
she did n't want to do be a propagandist .
but she really did n't have to . a + for fi n n ish schools since a study conducted by the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- recognized finland as having the world 's best schools , germans have been more interested in learning about the country of saunas and lakes .

the value of the company 's stock has grown by more than 400 percent since then . the national success story began with eu accession in 1995 .

unemployment rose from 3.5 percent to 18 percent and the gross domestic product sank by 27 percent . " finland did n't have time to lose , " högnabba said .
" the difficult situation forced the society to make difficult decisions . " social spending was cut severely .

but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty as well as save one . save a goal in a penalty shoot-out and you win stardom , miss and you may be turned back at the border on the way home .
in a split-second moment , you 're either hero or villain . but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty .
new details on the type of research roberto baggio and stuart pearce would have loved could be available for players lining up from the spot now that the 2006 cup has reached the knock-out stage . there are a number of ways sports physicists and psychologists say they can enhance the chances of players on either side of the ball . what the scientists say one of them is in training keepers in body language .
goalies who are alert to the kicker 's eyes , body posture and angle of his feet in the approach can gain as much as half a second to move in the right direction . scientists at john moores university in liverpool showed goalkeepers life-sized video footage of penalties being taken , filmed from the viewpoint of a keeper standing in the center of the goal . the film was stopped four times during the sequence - 120 milliseconds before the kick ; 40 milliseconds before ; at the point of impact ; and 40 milliseconds after - and the goalkeepers were asked at each stage to predict where the ball was going to be shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , considered to be the best in the world researchers found that the biggest clue was the position of the striker 's hips just before the strike . " if the taker 's hips are square-on to the goalkeeper in a right-footed kicker , the penalty goes to the right-hand side of the keeper , " the university 's mark williams said .
" if his hips are more ' open , ' or angled away from the goalkeeper , the kick tends to go to the left of the keeper . " research is two-sided but there are some shots that just ca n't be saved .
a study in biomechanics carried out at the university of bath in 2004 determined the maximum reach of a goalie 's dive , regardless of his size . it showed that , if the keeper stays on his line in accordance with the rules - which only the most inexperienced keepers bother with - 28 percent of the goal is an " unsaveable zone " that guarantees a score , provided the ball is kicked accurately and with reasonable force . but if you have to choose between placement and force , research shows blasting the ball to be the way to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hit your penalties as hard as possible " " hit your penalties as hard as possible , " kassam advised .
" research indicates that a penalty struck at more than 20 meters per second -lrb- 73 kilometers , 46 miles per hour -rrb- stands a greater chance of hitting the back of the net than a slower one , as a goalkeeper has less time to analyze visual clues and react . " according to fifa statistics , the kicker holds all the cards .
in the history of the tournament , 182 penalties have been awarded with 147 converted or 81 percent .
thirty-five have been missed with 22 of those blocked by the keeper . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty as well as save one . save a goal in a penalty shoot-out and you win stardom , miss and you may be turned back at the border on the way home .
in a split-second moment , you 're either hero or villain . but with the aid of science , some say , it 's possible to take the perfect penalty .
new details on the type of research roberto baggio and stuart pearce would have loved could be available for players lining up from the spot now that the 2006 cup has reached the knock-out stage . there are a number of ways sports physicists and psychologists say they can enhance the chances of players on either side of the ball . what the scientists say one of them is in training keepers in body language .
goalies who are alert to the kicker 's eyes , body posture and angle of his feet in the approach can gain as much as half a second to move in the right direction . scientists at john moores university in liverpool showed goalkeepers life-sized video footage of penalties being taken , filmed from the viewpoint of a keeper standing in the center of the goal . the film was stopped four times during the sequence - 120 milliseconds before the kick ; 40 milliseconds before ; at the point of impact ; and 40 milliseconds after - and the goalkeepers were asked at each stage to predict where the ball was going to be shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , considered to be the best in the world researchers found that the biggest clue was the position of the striker 's hips just before the strike . " if the taker 's hips are square-on to the goalkeeper in a right-footed kicker , the penalty goes to the right-hand side of the keeper , " the university 's mark williams said .
" if his hips are more ' open , ' or angled away from the goalkeeper , the kick tends to go to the left of the keeper . " research is two-sided but there are some shots that just ca n't be saved .
a study in biomechanics carried out at the university of bath in 2004 determined the maximum reach of a goalie 's dive , regardless of his size . it showed that , if the keeper stays on his line in accordance with the rules - which only the most inexperienced keepers bother with - 28 percent of the goal is an " unsaveable zone " that guarantees a score , provided the ball is kicked accurately and with reasonable force . but if you have to choose between placement and force , research shows blasting the ball to be the way to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hit your penalties as hard as possible " " hit your penalties as hard as possible , " kassam advised .
" research indicates that a penalty struck at more than 20 meters per second -lrb- 73 kilometers , 46 miles per hour -rrb- stands a greater chance of hitting the back of the net than a slower one , as a goalkeeper has less time to analyze visual clues and react . " according to fifa statistics , the kicker holds all the cards .
in the history of the tournament , 182 penalties have been awarded with 147 converted or 81 percent .
thirty-five have been missed with 22 of those blocked by the keeper . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .
could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ?
-lrb- may 29 , 2006 -rrb- do n't believe the hype : pre-cup favorites struggle through they arrived brimming with confidence , laden with stars and shouldering expectation .
the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks .

in front of her were dozens of officers ; as the prime minister 's convoy pulled up , armed plainclothes agents jumped out .
this was the southmead estate .
it has a grim reputation for crime and drugs , so was tony blair 's first stop on his two-day crusade in bristol to turn round the criminal justice system .
in the community hall he was at his best : for half an hour he listened earnestly and sympathised with the plight of ordinary folk whose lives have been blighted by antisocial behaviour .
contra opinion but even as inside all talk was of the city 's awful problems , outside there was an alternative view , from one who should know .
gary hopkins is the senior councillor who deals with this every day - and the facts read rather differently .
burglary , vehicle crime and robbery are at their lowest levels since 1998 .
" overall , crime has fallen in the avon and somerset force area , " he says , " while the fear of crime is below the national average . "
prepared speech day two and another hall , another audience - this time the grandeur of bristol university , and 300 invited guests from the city 's great and good .
also very different was the prime minister 's performance .
he spoke for 30 minutes , but to a prepared script , with more detail and less emotion .
" we are the first post-war british government that has seen crime fall during its term of office , " he said , and outlined some of the things they now planned .
new laws , that are clear and tough .
ensuring the courts can properly enforce them .
a greater focus on sorting out offenders ' problems , such as drugs .
prisons overflowing ?
and there was a clear warning : " the blunt reality is that , at least in the short and medium term , the measures proposed will mean an increase in prison places . "
the prime minister left ; he had seen a lot during his two days in the city .
but there was one place he was doubtless glad he drove straight past .
bristol prison is already 142 % full - it holds scores more inmates than it should .
with more people than ever before locked up in our jails , the overcrowding can only increase .
critics say imprisonment turns minor offenders into hardened criminals .
others reckon locking more people up is the reason that crime rates are falling .
but politicians are sure of one thing : there are few votes in being soft on crime .
join the debate on the politics show west on sunday 25 june .

mr fukui has been criticised for his investment links to a fund manager who is under arrest and charged with insider dealing .
economy and banking minister kaoru yosano said he understood why many people were angry with mr fukui .
but he warned that the governor 's resignation could harm the japanese and global economies .
mr fukui saw his investments in a fund run by yoshiaki murakami double in seven years to 22m yen -lrb- $ 190,000 ; £ 100,000 -rrb- .
ethical questions mr fukui made the investment before he became the bank of japan 's governor in 2003 .
but questions have been raised about the ethics of holding onto the investment while he held such a prominent public position .
" i understand the public 's anger , " mr yosano said .
" but the impact on japan 's economy , the global economy and global financial markets should be considered . "
he added : " given that there are some unstable elements in global markets , japan should not be sending the wrong message . "
mr fukui has apologised and said he would give any profits he made from the fund to charity .
but opposition politicians have said mr fukui was careless in his judgement and called for him to quit .
insider trading mr murakami has been indicted for alleged violations of japan 's securities laws .
he has admitted he was guilty of insider trading when buying shares in nippon broadcasting system in 2005 .
he said he bought shares knowing that livedoor would buy a stake in the firm .
mr murakami is then understood to have sold shares to livedoor , the once high-flying internet business which has become immersed in scandal , through his investment firm mac asset management .
if convicted , mr murakami - who said he acted unwittingly - could face up to three years in prison and a fine of 3 million yen -lrb- $ 25,900 -rrb- .
prime minister junichiro koizumi has backed mr fukui , who wants to see out his term which ends in march 2008 .
the case comes as the bank appears close to ending its policy of zero interest rates that has lasted for five years .
indications that the bank could raise rates sooner rather than later have alarmed some analysts who fear it could dampen the nation 's economic recovery .

by claire heald bbc news , stuttgart the number one complaint at the world cup is from fans that can not get a ticket .
meanwhile , the trade on the black market soars .
so how much will a ticket to the round-two match set england supporters back ?
mark and james refused a tout 's 1,000 euros asking price the serious business end of the world cup has arrived with the start of the knockout stages .
and in the ticket tout market , serious business is being dealt on the streets of stuttgart .
time to hide the notebook and get a few straight answers from touts .
how much would a ticket to the ecuador game cost an england fan ?
well organised stuttgart station is half a mile from the square where fans watch the matches .
the touts are not hard to spot here .
the big disgrace is that the tickets made available to the sponsors , are not being used by them james fortnum like every city or stadium , they skulk around not far from the entrance .
england fans short of a ticket can find them , should they so desire .
there is short shrift for journalists : " i 'll talk to you mate when ' big ears ' here as gone , " one tells a customer as he tries to cut a deal .
they are organised - handing over a home-made business card as they quote me a price .
and that price is £ 550 for one ticket .
at the stadium , fans say it is a £ 800 opening gambit down to £ 400 for the hard barterer .
at the station , there is no quick look allowed to gauge if it is real or fake .
prices will rise tomorrow during the day , perhaps falling again very close to kick-off .
and were england playing a better-ranked team , " the asking " would start from a higher base figure .
sponsors ' allocation many of these black market tickets came from the 12 tournament sponsors or from hospitality packages - they are named on the tickets .
some are sourced from countries ' football associations .
and spares are being traded between fans themselves .
of all the supply and demand scenarios in economics , it is hard to imagine a more skewed one than an england fan and a world cup ticket .
it is little green cards like these that the crowds are after the team has the strongest travelling support here .
but like every other team , the football association receives from fifa 8 % of the saleable tickets for england 's matches .
at sunday 's fixture , that is 4,200 seats in the stadium .
it includes an extra 580 that went on sale to members of the fa supporters group englandfans on friday .
some 80 % of its 25,000 members applied for tickets to the world cup .
of the allocation , 70 % went to fans with 14 ' caps ' , or england matches attended .
the rest went out in the fa ballot .
in cologne , an estimated 80,000 fans arrived to cheer on england and a similar figure is expected in stuttgart .
little wonder then that the free market has swung into action .
" the big disgrace is that the tickets made available to the sponsors , are not being used by them and are on the black market , " says england fan james fortnum .
" the england fans set the price .
if they said i 'm not going to pay over £ 200 , what would the touts do ?

barbara wilding told bbc wales ' politics show that wales had " perhaps some way to go yet in comparison to other parts of the country . "
her comments came ahead of a campaign against discrimination in the workplace by gay rights group stonewall cymru .
discrimination at work due to sexual orientation was outlawed in 2003 . "
south wales police have made dramatic progress - and i do n't use the word ' dramatic ' lightly " sgt craig bannister but ms wilding said some workplaces were still not complying with the law .
the stonewall survey found 25 % of lesbian , gay and bisexual people in wales had experienced being sacked because of their sexuality , a figure higher than the uk average .
the chief constable 's comments came on the eve of a new project by stonewall cymru to raise awareness of discrimination against gay people in welsh workplaces .
debbie lane of the lgbt -lrb- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -rrb- cymru helpline , said people who remain in their jobs too often suffer discrimination - from being overlooked for promotion to homophobic bullying , even violence .
ms lane said : " for example , people leaving messages on people 's workstations saying , ' people like you make me sick ' .
" then we have the extreme side of things where actual violence has occurred outside the workplace . "
stonewall cymru said too many gay workers did not know their rights , and too many of the agencies they turned to for advice were not up to speed with the law either .
stonewall cymru director alison parken said : " one of the things that we have done , with the help of government funding , is to introduce a training project to enable generalist advisors in citizens advice bureau around wales to understand the manifestation of sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace or harassment and give them advice about how to advise people . "
stonewall has assessed south wales police procedures and awarded them the title of welsh " diversity champions " alongside the likes of the driver and vehicle licensing agency in swansea , cardiff university and the welsh assembly government .
sgt craig bannister , a gay man working for ms wilding 's force , said the changes in the organisation 's attention to the concerns of gay staff had been " extraordinary " .
sgt bannister said : " south wales police have made dramatic progress - and i do n't use the word ' dramatic ' lightly - in the sense that very recently we have launched a gay staff network for police officers and police support staff . "

the news of the world said it wished him " the very best of luck " for the match .
internet rumours spread after the original stories were published and they generated much discussion in chatrooms .
the legal proceedings were being viewed by many lawyers as a test of how the libel law dealt with allegations made against unnamed individuals .
issuing writs , cole 's lawyer graham shear said the articles were " false and offensive " .
" there is no truth whatever in these allegations " , he said .
" ashley cole will not tolerate this kind of cowardly journalism or let it go unchallenged .
" it is disgraceful that he should be faced with this kind of unpleasant insinuation and innuendo at a time when he is trying to focus on this summer 's world cup and his forthcoming wedding . "

kilnsea 's existing flood defences are under threat of coastal erosion .
the new £ 200,000 embankment near spurn point will be built further away from the shoreline with a channel to divert floodwaters away from homes at risk .
east riding of yorkshire council said it hoped the work would safeguard residents for another 20 to 30 years .
kilnsea was identified in september 2005 as being at greater risk of flooding within the next five years when the environment agency released its humber flood risk management strategy .
the relatively small number of houses and the high cost of construction work meant proposals for a permanent flood alleviation scheme could not be supported from national funds .
but the east riding of yorkshire council can make a contribution to the scheme for the protection of public roads in the area .
the environment agency is also contributing £ 100,000 towards the scheme with the other £ 50,000 being met through community grants secured by residents .

the environment agency is also contributing £ 100,000 towards the scheme with the other £ 50,000 being met through community grants secured by residents .
