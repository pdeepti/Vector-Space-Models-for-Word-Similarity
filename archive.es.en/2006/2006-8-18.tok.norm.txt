" the rules of the deployment are expected to be worked out in the next few days , " merkel said . merkel added that contributing to a future peace mission in lebanon was " in germany 's fundamental interests . "
to forego the opportunity , citing events in the middle east as " too complicated , " would " cost germany massively in terms of international influence , " she said . merkel needs the support of parliament and coalition ministers from her christian democrats and from the social democrats to approve military help in lebanon . merkel rules out syrian border patrol the chancellor ruled out a proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to send german police to safeguard lebanon 's border with syria .
police federation groups rejected the plan , saying they are not equipped or trained for military service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy frigates are likely to be deployed merkel also indicated she foresaw sending a german navy hospital ship to treat injured civilians .
the defense ministry said such a ship would be available immediately . the german navy already has a presence in the region , participating in operation active endeavour , which was launched in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , to monitor ships and escort non-military vessels through the straits of gibraltar . german naval force to patrol lebanese coast german un ambassador thomas matussek speaking in new york on thursday said : " today i was in a position to offer a rather substantive maritime component which is so encompassing that it could patrol and secure the whole of the lebanese coast to make sure that no weapons or other related materials get into lebanon . " the united nations , meeting in new york to try to thrash out the make-up of the expanded peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern lebanon after a month of deadly conflict between israel and hezbollah , outlined a " robust " mandate for thousands of international peacekeepers to be deployed and called on member states to pledge troops to secure the ceasefire which has tentatively held now for four days following a month of fierce fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un members are close to agreeing on a lebanon force matussek said nearly all the delegations speaking at the closed-door meeting had offered troops for the force .
" if i add it up , i think we are almost there , " he said .
ten to 15 delegations had made some sort of commitment to the force , he said .
germany , however , would not be one of those contributing combat troops to the lebanon force . germany has about 7,700 military personnel serving abroad , including in the mediterranean sea and off the horn of africa .
the army 's budget , amounting this year to 23.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.5 billion -rrb- , has remained static in real terms since 2002 . steinmeier considers syrian dialogue meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he was still open to talks with syria , two days after canceling a visit because president bashar al-assad described israel as " an enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier told deutschlandfunk radio that he held out hope syria could play a constructive role in working toward a lasting peace between israel and the hezbollah militia but said damascus must show it is willing . " i explained my decision , which was the only one i could make , to the syrian foreign minister and told him that my position remained unchanged that we have grounds and an opportunity to draw syria into a constructive role in the stabilization process " of lebanon , steinmeier said . " i am unsatisfied with the fact that what i had planned and what i consider to be right - integrating syria into the process - did not succeed .
that is why i told my colleague we are ready for dialogue but not at any cost . " steinmeier had been due to arrive in syria on tuesday evening and hold talks with assad the following day as part of a tour that also took in jordan and saudi arabia .
the trip was intended to urge regional powers to foster a lasting peace in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad assad had said in a wide-ranging speech that it was an honor for syria to support the shiite muslim hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier told deutschlandfunk that assad 's remarks had left him with no other choice than to cancel the visit .
" what we need is verbal disarmament and we need contributions to the stabilization of a still fragile truce .
what we surely do not need are calls to resistance against all those who attempt to secure this ceasefire .

" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .

for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .

mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .

one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .

he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

" the rules of the deployment are expected to be worked out in the next few days , " merkel said . merkel added that contributing to a future peace mission in lebanon was " in germany 's fundamental interests . "
to forego the opportunity , citing events in the middle east as " too complicated , " would " cost germany massively in terms of international influence , " she said . merkel needs the support of parliament and coalition ministers from her christian democrats and from the social democrats to approve military help in lebanon . merkel rules out syrian border patrol the chancellor ruled out a proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to send german police to safeguard lebanon 's border with syria .

the defense ministry said such a ship would be available immediately . the german navy already has a presence in the region , participating in operation active endeavour , which was launched in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , to monitor ships and escort non-military vessels through the straits of gibraltar . german naval force to patrol lebanese coast german un ambassador thomas matussek speaking in new york on thursday said : " today i was in a position to offer a rather substantive maritime component which is so encompassing that it could patrol and secure the whole of the lebanese coast to make sure that no weapons or other related materials get into lebanon . " the united nations , meeting in new york to try to thrash out the make-up of the expanded peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern lebanon after a month of deadly conflict between israel and hezbollah , outlined a " robust " mandate for thousands of international peacekeepers to be deployed and called on member states to pledge troops to secure the ceasefire which has tentatively held now for four days following a month of fierce fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un members are close to agreeing on a lebanon force matussek said nearly all the delegations speaking at the closed-door meeting had offered troops for the force .

ten to 15 delegations had made some sort of commitment to the force , he said .
germany , however , would not be one of those contributing combat troops to the lebanon force . germany has about 7,700 military personnel serving abroad , including in the mediterranean sea and off the horn of africa .
the army 's budget , amounting this year to 23.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.5 billion -rrb- , has remained static in real terms since 2002 . steinmeier considers syrian dialogue meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he was still open to talks with syria , two days after canceling a visit because president bashar al-assad described israel as " an enemy .

" i am unsatisfied with the fact that what i had planned and what i consider to be right - integrating syria into the process - did not succeed .
that is why i told my colleague we are ready for dialogue but not at any cost . " steinmeier had been due to arrive in syria on tuesday evening and hold talks with assad the following day as part of a tour that also took in jordan and saudi arabia .

" the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area .

" the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .
but environment groups worry about calls from other ruling coalition members to re-examine the topic . " there are continually new attempts to re-open this issue , " theunissen said .
" it needs to be made clear that there is no option other than putting an end to the use of nuclear energy . " nabu had also hoped that a common environmental policy , an issue merkel herself promoted , would not fall victim to germany 's recent federalism reform and leave the country 's 16 states to decide on their own environmental regulations , theunissen added . " it is like a starting signal for ecological dumping , " she said of the reform that could go into effect in 2010 .
" when every state can make its own laws and exceptions , it is questionable a common environmental policy is possible . " economy comes before environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plants account for a large amount of greenhouse gasses matthias seiche of friends for the earth germany -lrb- bund -rrb- criticized the government for putting business interests ahead of environmental protection and cited the example of the number of free european union emissions trading certificates gabriel 's ministry has awarded . " after taking office and saying the problem of climate change has been taken too lightly , he put the interests of the coal lobby first by giving power plant operators building new coal plants more than double as many free emission rights as he did for those building modern gas plants , " seiche said . both environmental groups also criticized the automobile industry 's ability to influence legislation . " the eu mandated a labeling system for fuel use in cars that the auto industry did not want , but the eu made it mandatory , " seiche said .
" what we ended up with was a minimal consensus that in many cases , but not all , requires co2 rates to be marked . " balancing interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public transport should get priority over new highways , theunissen said nabu 's theunissen added that the government needed to shift its focus from building " prestige objects , " such as highways and airports , to more environmentally friendly means of transportation . " cuts should not be being made to local public transportation , " she said , adding that the government had passed a law to slash mass transport funding by a total of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- over three years . the key lies in finding a balance between promoting business and protecting the environment , theunissen said . " the only way germany is going to be able to move forward is when it is clear that both issues need to be developed , " she said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister demands stricter safety standards for nuclear reactors germany 's environment minister wants higher safety standards at nuclear plants and has ruled out extending life spans for older reactors .
the move comes on the heels of reactor closures in sweden due to safety concerns .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .
" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .
they offer advice and information , increasingly on the internet , since the medium is now integral as a way of making sexual contacts .
and they demand that the pharmaceutical industry revert to advertising which shows hiv as the life-threatening disease it is . experts believe that germans are generally well-informed about aids . but every generation of young people has to be educated again . it 's an endless task . immigrants in germany at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants are less likely to go for testing in germany but one of the most worrying developments centers on the immigrant populations living in germany .
ulrich heide of the german aids foundation says a lot of the education and information they supply simply misses this section of the population . heide points to a current study by the health ministry which shows that people from immigrant backgrounds living in germany know much less about hiv and aids than germans but there are some sectors of the immigrant population which arrive with basic information on the disease . " interestingly enough , people from sub-saharan africa are better informed that people from eastern and southern europe , " heide said .
" that 's evidently because the africans bring their knowledge with them from their homelands . " spreading the word , not the virus once in germany , migrants learn almost nothing more about aids because they are frightened of visiting the counseling centers . german aids support is trying to train counselors who speak the languages of the immigrant groups , so that they can deal with the subject in a way which is sensitive to their cultural needs , and , that way , make better contact with the people who are affected . in that way , one of the most " at risk " groups will get the information they need to protect themselves and others . michael ramirez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hiv infections on the rise new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life .

" we have to accept the fact that this compromise , which was forced on us , could see some clinics close their doors , " foit told reporters . thursday 's wage increase agreement " represents an additional financial burden for the community hospitals that may not be manageable for some clinics , " stephan articus , director of the association of german cities and towns , told dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal followed eight weeks of strikes and a 30-hour marathon negotiation most community clinics are already under considerable financial pressure due to ongoing federal healthcare reforms , he added . higher wages in both doctor cases jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of the federal doctors ' chamber , was pleased with the result .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2006 opinion : germany 's new vulnerability in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot , eldad beck , welcomes germany 's involvement in the middle east conflict .
but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2006 opinion : germany 's new vulnerability in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot , eldad beck , welcomes germany 's involvement in the middle east conflict .
but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

" the rules of the deployment are expected to be worked out in the next few days , " merkel said . merkel added that contributing to a future peace mission in lebanon was " in germany 's fundamental interests . "
to forego the opportunity , citing events in the middle east as " too complicated , " would " cost germany massively in terms of international influence , " she said . merkel needs the support of parliament and coalition ministers from her christian democrats and from the social democrats to approve military help in lebanon . merkel rules out syrian border patrol the chancellor ruled out a proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to send german police to safeguard lebanon 's border with syria .
police federation groups rejected the plan , saying they are not equipped or trained for military service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy frigates are likely to be deployed merkel also indicated she foresaw sending a german navy hospital ship to treat injured civilians .
the defense ministry said such a ship would be available immediately . the german navy already has a presence in the region , participating in operation active endeavour , which was launched in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , to monitor ships and escort non-military vessels through the straits of gibraltar . german naval force to patrol lebanese coast german un ambassador thomas matussek speaking in new york on thursday said : " today i was in a position to offer a rather substantive maritime component which is so encompassing that it could patrol and secure the whole of the lebanese coast to make sure that no weapons or other related materials get into lebanon . " the united nations , meeting in new york to try to thrash out the make-up of the expanded peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern lebanon after a month of deadly conflict between israel and hezbollah , outlined a " robust " mandate for thousands of international peacekeepers to be deployed and called on member states to pledge troops to secure the ceasefire which has tentatively held now for four days following a month of fierce fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un members are close to agreeing on a lebanon force matussek said nearly all the delegations speaking at the closed-door meeting had offered troops for the force .
" if i add it up , i think we are almost there , " he said .
ten to 15 delegations had made some sort of commitment to the force , he said .
germany , however , would not be one of those contributing combat troops to the lebanon force . germany has about 7,700 military personnel serving abroad , including in the mediterranean sea and off the horn of africa .
the army 's budget , amounting this year to 23.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.5 billion -rrb- , has remained static in real terms since 2002 . steinmeier considers syrian dialogue meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he was still open to talks with syria , two days after canceling a visit because president bashar al-assad described israel as " an enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier told deutschlandfunk radio that he held out hope syria could play a constructive role in working toward a lasting peace between israel and the hezbollah militia but said damascus must show it is willing . " i explained my decision , which was the only one i could make , to the syrian foreign minister and told him that my position remained unchanged that we have grounds and an opportunity to draw syria into a constructive role in the stabilization process " of lebanon , steinmeier said . " i am unsatisfied with the fact that what i had planned and what i consider to be right - integrating syria into the process - did not succeed .
that is why i told my colleague we are ready for dialogue but not at any cost . " steinmeier had been due to arrive in syria on tuesday evening and hold talks with assad the following day as part of a tour that also took in jordan and saudi arabia .
the trip was intended to urge regional powers to foster a lasting peace in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad assad had said in a wide-ranging speech that it was an honor for syria to support the shiite muslim hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier told deutschlandfunk that assad 's remarks had left him with no other choice than to cancel the visit .
" what we need is verbal disarmament and we need contributions to the stabilization of a still fragile truce .
what we surely do not need are calls to resistance against all those who attempt to secure this ceasefire .

" the rules of the deployment are expected to be worked out in the next few days , " merkel said . merkel added that contributing to a future peace mission in lebanon was " in germany 's fundamental interests . "
to forego the opportunity , citing events in the middle east as " too complicated , " would " cost germany massively in terms of international influence , " she said . merkel needs the support of parliament and coalition ministers from her christian democrats and from the social democrats to approve military help in lebanon . merkel rules out syrian border patrol the chancellor ruled out a proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to send german police to safeguard lebanon 's border with syria .
police federation groups rejected the plan , saying they are not equipped or trained for military service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy frigates are likely to be deployed merkel also indicated she foresaw sending a german navy hospital ship to treat injured civilians .
the defense ministry said such a ship would be available immediately . the german navy already has a presence in the region , participating in operation active endeavour , which was launched in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , to monitor ships and escort non-military vessels through the straits of gibraltar . german naval force to patrol lebanese coast german un ambassador thomas matussek speaking in new york on thursday said : " today i was in a position to offer a rather substantive maritime component which is so encompassing that it could patrol and secure the whole of the lebanese coast to make sure that no weapons or other related materials get into lebanon . " the united nations , meeting in new york to try to thrash out the make-up of the expanded peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern lebanon after a month of deadly conflict between israel and hezbollah , outlined a " robust " mandate for thousands of international peacekeepers to be deployed and called on member states to pledge troops to secure the ceasefire which has tentatively held now for four days following a month of fierce fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un members are close to agreeing on a lebanon force matussek said nearly all the delegations speaking at the closed-door meeting had offered troops for the force .
" if i add it up , i think we are almost there , " he said .
ten to 15 delegations had made some sort of commitment to the force , he said .
germany , however , would not be one of those contributing combat troops to the lebanon force . germany has about 7,700 military personnel serving abroad , including in the mediterranean sea and off the horn of africa .
the army 's budget , amounting this year to 23.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.5 billion -rrb- , has remained static in real terms since 2002 . steinmeier considers syrian dialogue meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he was still open to talks with syria , two days after canceling a visit because president bashar al-assad described israel as " an enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier told deutschlandfunk radio that he held out hope syria could play a constructive role in working toward a lasting peace between israel and the hezbollah militia but said damascus must show it is willing . " i explained my decision , which was the only one i could make , to the syrian foreign minister and told him that my position remained unchanged that we have grounds and an opportunity to draw syria into a constructive role in the stabilization process " of lebanon , steinmeier said . " i am unsatisfied with the fact that what i had planned and what i consider to be right - integrating syria into the process - did not succeed .
that is why i told my colleague we are ready for dialogue but not at any cost . " steinmeier had been due to arrive in syria on tuesday evening and hold talks with assad the following day as part of a tour that also took in jordan and saudi arabia .
the trip was intended to urge regional powers to foster a lasting peace in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad assad had said in a wide-ranging speech that it was an honor for syria to support the shiite muslim hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier told deutschlandfunk that assad 's remarks had left him with no other choice than to cancel the visit .
" what we need is verbal disarmament and we need contributions to the stabilization of a still fragile truce .
what we surely do not need are calls to resistance against all those who attempt to secure this ceasefire .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .

so far it has received solid pledges of 3,500 soldiers , up to 2,000 of whom be coming from bangladesh , according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1,500 french troops would stay in the region , but under french control , chirac said french president jacques chirac announced late on thursday that france was ready to contribute a total of 400 additional troops to help shore up a fragile truce now in its fifth day - far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . " we had hoped - we make no secret of it - that there would be a stronger french contribution , " said mark malloch brown , un deputy secretary general .
" others have come forward and we are pretty convinced we 've got the elements here of a strong force . " clarifying the rules of engagement germany ruled out contributing ground troops but proposed sending a " maritime protection component " with its navy taking part in the future deployment , saying any moves hinged on the establishment of clear rules of engagement .
denmark also pledged to patrol the mediterranean ocean . with its troops tied down in iraq , london promised that while it would take part in the peacekeeping force , its contribution would come in the form of air and sea support and not ground troops , according to emyr jones parry , great britain 's un 's ambassador . the focus has now moved to italy , spain and belgium , which can move forces to lebanon quickly to meet the un 's own 15-day deadline for an immediate deployment of 3,500 soldiers with the rest of the force in place by nov .
4 . many " interesting offers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peacekeepers will bolster 15,000 lebanese troops being sent to the israeli border italy has said it could quickly send as many as 3,000 soldiers - up from its current contribution of about 50 - but italian prime minister romano prodi 's office said it , like the other nations , was pushing for explicit ground rules . " the draft rules of engagement call for the use of force to prevent the -lrb- un forces in lebanon -rrb- area of deployment and operations from being used to hostile activities , " brown said . indonesia , malaysia and nepal , among others , offered ground troops , participants at the meeting told reuters . barracks and hospitals were offered by cyprus , which also said it could serve as a regional transit hub , and the united states said it would provide planning and logistics capabilities . " we 've had a lot of interesting offers , some fairly firm , some conditional on seeing the rules of engagement and the concept of operations , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2006 apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts fear that the message of aids awareness is falling on deaf ears as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home . the news is depressing .
the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .
" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .
they offer advice and information , increasingly on the internet , since the medium is now integral as a way of making sexual contacts .
and they demand that the pharmaceutical industry revert to advertising which shows hiv as the life-threatening disease it is . experts believe that germans are generally well-informed about aids . but every generation of young people has to be educated again . it 's an endless task . immigrants in germany at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants are less likely to go for testing in germany but one of the most worrying developments centers on the immigrant populations living in germany .
ulrich heide of the german aids foundation says a lot of the education and information they supply simply misses this section of the population . heide points to a current study by the health ministry which shows that people from immigrant backgrounds living in germany know much less about hiv and aids than germans but there are some sectors of the immigrant population which arrive with basic information on the disease . " interestingly enough , people from sub-saharan africa are better informed that people from eastern and southern europe , " heide said .
" that 's evidently because the africans bring their knowledge with them from their homelands . " spreading the word , not the virus once in germany , migrants learn almost nothing more about aids because they are frightened of visiting the counseling centers . german aids support is trying to train counselors who speak the languages of the immigrant groups , so that they can deal with the subject in a way which is sensitive to their cultural needs , and , that way , make better contact with the people who are affected . in that way , one of the most " at risk " groups will get the information they need to protect themselves and others . michael ramirez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hiv infections on the rise new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .

" the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .
but environment groups worry about calls from other ruling coalition members to re-examine the topic . " there are continually new attempts to re-open this issue , " theunissen said .
" it needs to be made clear that there is no option other than putting an end to the use of nuclear energy . " nabu had also hoped that a common environmental policy , an issue merkel herself promoted , would not fall victim to germany 's recent federalism reform and leave the country 's 16 states to decide on their own environmental regulations , theunissen added . " it is like a starting signal for ecological dumping , " she said of the reform that could go into effect in 2010 .
" when every state can make its own laws and exceptions , it is questionable a common environmental policy is possible . " economy comes before environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plants account for a large amount of greenhouse gasses matthias seiche of friends for the earth germany -lrb- bund -rrb- criticized the government for putting business interests ahead of environmental protection and cited the example of the number of free european union emissions trading certificates gabriel 's ministry has awarded . " after taking office and saying the problem of climate change has been taken too lightly , he put the interests of the coal lobby first by giving power plant operators building new coal plants more than double as many free emission rights as he did for those building modern gas plants , " seiche said . both environmental groups also criticized the automobile industry 's ability to influence legislation . " the eu mandated a labeling system for fuel use in cars that the auto industry did not want , but the eu made it mandatory , " seiche said .
" what we ended up with was a minimal consensus that in many cases , but not all , requires co2 rates to be marked . " balancing interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public transport should get priority over new highways , theunissen said nabu 's theunissen added that the government needed to shift its focus from building " prestige objects , " such as highways and airports , to more environmentally friendly means of transportation . " cuts should not be being made to local public transportation , " she said , adding that the government had passed a law to slash mass transport funding by a total of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- over three years . the key lies in finding a balance between promoting business and protecting the environment , theunissen said .

as the union celebrates its victory , some fear the deal is too costly . after eight weeks of sporadic strikes , german health officials agreed thursday to a wage increase for some 70,000 doctors at community hospitals in around 700 districts . the doctors ' union , the marburger bund , said the deal includes a wage increase of four percent for specialists and three percent for interns .
in addition , they will be paid more for on-call duty and shift hours are to be limited , according to german news agency dpa . deal may put some clinics in the red frank montgomery , head of the marburger bund , welcomed the agreement , but chief negotiator for the community hospitals otto foit said it could cripple some clinics . " we have to accept the fact that this compromise , which was forced on us , could see some clinics close their doors , " foit told reporters . thursday 's wage increase agreement " represents an additional financial burden for the community hospitals that may not be manageable for some clinics , " stephan articus , director of the association of german cities and towns , told dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal followed eight weeks of strikes and a 30-hour marathon negotiation most community clinics are already under considerable financial pressure due to ongoing federal healthcare reforms , he added . higher wages in both doctor cases jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of the federal doctors ' chamber , was pleased with the result . " the continuous decline in wages from the past few years has been stopped , " he told the dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten . thursday 's deal comes two months after some 22,000 doctors at germany 's university hospitals secured a wage increase after regularly walking off the job over a three-month period . the strikes in the twin salary disputes were the worst the german health care sector has ever seen . afp / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de university clinics demand compensation for strikes a strike by doctors in germany 's public hospitals over wages and working hours that began in march has resulted in losses of millions of euros .

so far it has received solid pledges of 3,500 soldiers , up to 2,000 of whom be coming from bangladesh , according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1,500 french troops would stay in the region , but under french control , chirac said french president jacques chirac announced late on thursday that france was ready to contribute a total of 400 additional troops to help shore up a fragile truce now in its fifth day - far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . " we had hoped - we make no secret of it - that there would be a stronger french contribution , " said mark malloch brown , un deputy secretary general .
" others have come forward and we are pretty convinced we 've got the elements here of a strong force . " clarifying the rules of engagement germany ruled out contributing ground troops but proposed sending a " maritime protection component " with its navy taking part in the future deployment , saying any moves hinged on the establishment of clear rules of engagement .
denmark also pledged to patrol the mediterranean ocean . with its troops tied down in iraq , london promised that while it would take part in the peacekeeping force , its contribution would come in the form of air and sea support and not ground troops , according to emyr jones parry , great britain 's un 's ambassador . the focus has now moved to italy , spain and belgium , which can move forces to lebanon quickly to meet the un 's own 15-day deadline for an immediate deployment of 3,500 soldiers with the rest of the force in place by nov .
4 . many " interesting offers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peacekeepers will bolster 15,000 lebanese troops being sent to the israeli border italy has said it could quickly send as many as 3,000 soldiers - up from its current contribution of about 50 - but italian prime minister romano prodi 's office said it , like the other nations , was pushing for explicit ground rules . " the draft rules of engagement call for the use of force to prevent the -lrb- un forces in lebanon -rrb- area of deployment and operations from being used to hostile activities , " brown said . indonesia , malaysia and nepal , among others , offered ground troops , participants at the meeting told reuters . barracks and hospitals were offered by cyprus , which also said it could serve as a regional transit hub , and the united states said it would provide planning and logistics capabilities . " we 've had a lot of interesting offers , some fairly firm , some conditional on seeing the rules of engagement and the concept of operations , " he added .

" the rules of the deployment are expected to be worked out in the next few days , " merkel said . merkel added that contributing to a future peace mission in lebanon was " in germany 's fundamental interests . "
to forego the opportunity , citing events in the middle east as " too complicated , " would " cost germany massively in terms of international influence , " she said . merkel needs the support of parliament and coalition ministers from her christian democrats and from the social democrats to approve military help in lebanon . merkel rules out syrian border patrol the chancellor ruled out a proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to send german police to safeguard lebanon 's border with syria .
police federation groups rejected the plan , saying they are not equipped or trained for military service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy frigates are likely to be deployed merkel also indicated she foresaw sending a german navy hospital ship to treat injured civilians .
the defense ministry said such a ship would be available immediately . the german navy already has a presence in the region , participating in operation active endeavour , which was launched in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , to monitor ships and escort non-military vessels through the straits of gibraltar . german naval force to patrol lebanese coast german un ambassador thomas matussek speaking in new york on thursday said : " today i was in a position to offer a rather substantive maritime component which is so encompassing that it could patrol and secure the whole of the lebanese coast to make sure that no weapons or other related materials get into lebanon . " the united nations , meeting in new york to try to thrash out the make-up of the expanded peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern lebanon after a month of deadly conflict between israel and hezbollah , outlined a " robust " mandate for thousands of international peacekeepers to be deployed and called on member states to pledge troops to secure the ceasefire which has tentatively held now for four days following a month of fierce fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un members are close to agreeing on a lebanon force matussek said nearly all the delegations speaking at the closed-door meeting had offered troops for the force .
" if i add it up , i think we are almost there , " he said .
ten to 15 delegations had made some sort of commitment to the force , he said .
germany , however , would not be one of those contributing combat troops to the lebanon force . germany has about 7,700 military personnel serving abroad , including in the mediterranean sea and off the horn of africa .
the army 's budget , amounting this year to 23.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.5 billion -rrb- , has remained static in real terms since 2002 . steinmeier considers syrian dialogue meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he was still open to talks with syria , two days after canceling a visit because president bashar al-assad described israel as " an enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier told deutschlandfunk radio that he held out hope syria could play a constructive role in working toward a lasting peace between israel and the hezbollah militia but said damascus must show it is willing . " i explained my decision , which was the only one i could make , to the syrian foreign minister and told him that my position remained unchanged that we have grounds and an opportunity to draw syria into a constructive role in the stabilization process " of lebanon , steinmeier said . " i am unsatisfied with the fact that what i had planned and what i consider to be right - integrating syria into the process - did not succeed .
that is why i told my colleague we are ready for dialogue but not at any cost . " steinmeier had been due to arrive in syria on tuesday evening and hold talks with assad the following day as part of a tour that also took in jordan and saudi arabia .

" what we need is verbal disarmament and we need contributions to the stabilization of a still fragile truce .

so far it has received solid pledges of 3,500 soldiers , up to 2,000 of whom be coming from bangladesh , according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1,500 french troops would stay in the region , but under french control , chirac said french president jacques chirac announced late on thursday that france was ready to contribute a total of 400 additional troops to help shore up a fragile truce now in its fifth day - far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . " we had hoped - we make no secret of it - that there would be a stronger french contribution , " said mark malloch brown , un deputy secretary general .
" others have come forward and we are pretty convinced we 've got the elements here of a strong force . " clarifying the rules of engagement germany ruled out contributing ground troops but proposed sending a " maritime protection component " with its navy taking part in the future deployment , saying any moves hinged on the establishment of clear rules of engagement .
denmark also pledged to patrol the mediterranean ocean . with its troops tied down in iraq , london promised that while it would take part in the peacekeeping force , its contribution would come in the form of air and sea support and not ground troops , according to emyr jones parry , great britain 's un 's ambassador . the focus has now moved to italy , spain and belgium , which can move forces to lebanon quickly to meet the un 's own 15-day deadline for an immediate deployment of 3,500 soldiers with the rest of the force in place by nov .
4 . many " interesting offers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peacekeepers will bolster 15,000 lebanese troops being sent to the israeli border italy has said it could quickly send as many as 3,000 soldiers - up from its current contribution of about 50 - but italian prime minister romano prodi 's office said it , like the other nations , was pushing for explicit ground rules . " the draft rules of engagement call for the use of force to prevent the -lrb- un forces in lebanon -rrb- area of deployment and operations from being used to hostile activities , " brown said . indonesia , malaysia and nepal , among others , offered ground troops , participants at the meeting told reuters . barracks and hospitals were offered by cyprus , which also said it could serve as a regional transit hub , and the united states said it would provide planning and logistics capabilities . " we 've had a lot of interesting offers , some fairly firm , some conditional on seeing the rules of engagement and the concept of operations , " he added .

" the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .
but environment groups worry about calls from other ruling coalition members to re-examine the topic . " there are continually new attempts to re-open this issue , " theunissen said .
" it needs to be made clear that there is no option other than putting an end to the use of nuclear energy . " nabu had also hoped that a common environmental policy , an issue merkel herself promoted , would not fall victim to germany 's recent federalism reform and leave the country 's 16 states to decide on their own environmental regulations , theunissen added .

so far it has received solid pledges of 3,500 soldiers , up to 2,000 of whom be coming from bangladesh , according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1,500 french troops would stay in the region , but under french control , chirac said french president jacques chirac announced late on thursday that france was ready to contribute a total of 400 additional troops to help shore up a fragile truce now in its fifth day - far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . " we had hoped - we make no secret of it - that there would be a stronger french contribution , " said mark malloch brown , un deputy secretary general .
" others have come forward and we are pretty convinced we 've got the elements here of a strong force . " clarifying the rules of engagement germany ruled out contributing ground troops but proposed sending a " maritime protection component " with its navy taking part in the future deployment , saying any moves hinged on the establishment of clear rules of engagement .
denmark also pledged to patrol the mediterranean ocean . with its troops tied down in iraq , london promised that while it would take part in the peacekeeping force , its contribution would come in the form of air and sea support and not ground troops , according to emyr jones parry , great britain 's un 's ambassador . the focus has now moved to italy , spain and belgium , which can move forces to lebanon quickly to meet the un 's own 15-day deadline for an immediate deployment of 3,500 soldiers with the rest of the force in place by nov .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life .

" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .
they offer advice and information , increasingly on the internet , since the medium is now integral as a way of making sexual contacts .
and they demand that the pharmaceutical industry revert to advertising which shows hiv as the life-threatening disease it is . experts believe that germans are generally well-informed about aids . but every generation of young people has to be educated again . it 's an endless task . immigrants in germany at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants are less likely to go for testing in germany but one of the most worrying developments centers on the immigrant populations living in germany .
ulrich heide of the german aids foundation says a lot of the education and information they supply simply misses this section of the population . heide points to a current study by the health ministry which shows that people from immigrant backgrounds living in germany know much less about hiv and aids than germans but there are some sectors of the immigrant population which arrive with basic information on the disease . " interestingly enough , people from sub-saharan africa are better informed that people from eastern and southern europe , " heide said .
" that 's evidently because the africans bring their knowledge with them from their homelands . " spreading the word , not the virus once in germany , migrants learn almost nothing more about aids because they are frightened of visiting the counseling centers . german aids support is trying to train counselors who speak the languages of the immigrant groups , so that they can deal with the subject in a way which is sensitive to their cultural needs , and , that way , make better contact with the people who are affected . in that way , one of the most " at risk " groups will get the information they need to protect themselves and others . michael ramirez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hiv infections on the rise new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase .

" the rules of the deployment are expected to be worked out in the next few days , " merkel said . merkel added that contributing to a future peace mission in lebanon was " in germany 's fundamental interests . "
to forego the opportunity , citing events in the middle east as " too complicated , " would " cost germany massively in terms of international influence , " she said . merkel needs the support of parliament and coalition ministers from her christian democrats and from the social democrats to approve military help in lebanon . merkel rules out syrian border patrol the chancellor ruled out a proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to send german police to safeguard lebanon 's border with syria .
police federation groups rejected the plan , saying they are not equipped or trained for military service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy frigates are likely to be deployed merkel also indicated she foresaw sending a german navy hospital ship to treat injured civilians .
the defense ministry said such a ship would be available immediately . the german navy already has a presence in the region , participating in operation active endeavour , which was launched in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , to monitor ships and escort non-military vessels through the straits of gibraltar . german naval force to patrol lebanese coast german un ambassador thomas matussek speaking in new york on thursday said : " today i was in a position to offer a rather substantive maritime component which is so encompassing that it could patrol and secure the whole of the lebanese coast to make sure that no weapons or other related materials get into lebanon . " the united nations , meeting in new york to try to thrash out the make-up of the expanded peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern lebanon after a month of deadly conflict between israel and hezbollah , outlined a " robust " mandate for thousands of international peacekeepers to be deployed and called on member states to pledge troops to secure the ceasefire which has tentatively held now for four days following a month of fierce fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un members are close to agreeing on a lebanon force matussek said nearly all the delegations speaking at the closed-door meeting had offered troops for the force .
" if i add it up , i think we are almost there , " he said .
ten to 15 delegations had made some sort of commitment to the force , he said .
germany , however , would not be one of those contributing combat troops to the lebanon force . germany has about 7,700 military personnel serving abroad , including in the mediterranean sea and off the horn of africa .
the army 's budget , amounting this year to 23.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.5 billion -rrb- , has remained static in real terms since 2002 . steinmeier considers syrian dialogue meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he was still open to talks with syria , two days after canceling a visit because president bashar al-assad described israel as " an enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier told deutschlandfunk radio that he held out hope syria could play a constructive role in working toward a lasting peace between israel and the hezbollah militia but said damascus must show it is willing . " i explained my decision , which was the only one i could make , to the syrian foreign minister and told him that my position remained unchanged that we have grounds and an opportunity to draw syria into a constructive role in the stabilization process " of lebanon , steinmeier said . " i am unsatisfied with the fact that what i had planned and what i consider to be right - integrating syria into the process - did not succeed .
that is why i told my colleague we are ready for dialogue but not at any cost . " steinmeier had been due to arrive in syria on tuesday evening and hold talks with assad the following day as part of a tour that also took in jordan and saudi arabia .
the trip was intended to urge regional powers to foster a lasting peace in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad assad had said in a wide-ranging speech that it was an honor for syria to support the shiite muslim hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier told deutschlandfunk that assad 's remarks had left him with no other choice than to cancel the visit .
" what we need is verbal disarmament and we need contributions to the stabilization of a still fragile truce .
what we surely do not need are calls to resistance against all those who attempt to secure this ceasefire .

so far it has received solid pledges of 3,500 soldiers , up to 2,000 of whom be coming from bangladesh , according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1,500 french troops would stay in the region , but under french control , chirac said french president jacques chirac announced late on thursday that france was ready to contribute a total of 400 additional troops to help shore up a fragile truce now in its fifth day - far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . " we had hoped - we make no secret of it - that there would be a stronger french contribution , " said mark malloch brown , un deputy secretary general .
" others have come forward and we are pretty convinced we 've got the elements here of a strong force . " clarifying the rules of engagement germany ruled out contributing ground troops but proposed sending a " maritime protection component " with its navy taking part in the future deployment , saying any moves hinged on the establishment of clear rules of engagement .
denmark also pledged to patrol the mediterranean ocean . with its troops tied down in iraq , london promised that while it would take part in the peacekeeping force , its contribution would come in the form of air and sea support and not ground troops , according to emyr jones parry , great britain 's un 's ambassador . the focus has now moved to italy , spain and belgium , which can move forces to lebanon quickly to meet the un 's own 15-day deadline for an immediate deployment of 3,500 soldiers with the rest of the force in place by nov .
4 . many " interesting offers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peacekeepers will bolster 15,000 lebanese troops being sent to the israeli border italy has said it could quickly send as many as 3,000 soldiers - up from its current contribution of about 50 - but italian prime minister romano prodi 's office said it , like the other nations , was pushing for explicit ground rules . " the draft rules of engagement call for the use of force to prevent the -lrb- un forces in lebanon -rrb- area of deployment and operations from being used to hostile activities , " brown said . indonesia , malaysia and nepal , among others , offered ground troops , participants at the meeting told reuters . barracks and hospitals were offered by cyprus , which also said it could serve as a regional transit hub , and the united states said it would provide planning and logistics capabilities . " we 've had a lot of interesting offers , some fairly firm , some conditional on seeing the rules of engagement and the concept of operations , " he added .

" the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .
but environment groups worry about calls from other ruling coalition members to re-examine the topic . " there are continually new attempts to re-open this issue , " theunissen said .
" it needs to be made clear that there is no option other than putting an end to the use of nuclear energy . " nabu had also hoped that a common environmental policy , an issue merkel herself promoted , would not fall victim to germany 's recent federalism reform and leave the country 's 16 states to decide on their own environmental regulations , theunissen added . " it is like a starting signal for ecological dumping , " she said of the reform that could go into effect in 2010 .
" when every state can make its own laws and exceptions , it is questionable a common environmental policy is possible . " economy comes before environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plants account for a large amount of greenhouse gasses matthias seiche of friends for the earth germany -lrb- bund -rrb- criticized the government for putting business interests ahead of environmental protection and cited the example of the number of free european union emissions trading certificates gabriel 's ministry has awarded . " after taking office and saying the problem of climate change has been taken too lightly , he put the interests of the coal lobby first by giving power plant operators building new coal plants more than double as many free emission rights as he did for those building modern gas plants , " seiche said . both environmental groups also criticized the automobile industry 's ability to influence legislation . " the eu mandated a labeling system for fuel use in cars that the auto industry did not want , but the eu made it mandatory , " seiche said .
" what we ended up with was a minimal consensus that in many cases , but not all , requires co2 rates to be marked . " balancing interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public transport should get priority over new highways , theunissen said nabu 's theunissen added that the government needed to shift its focus from building " prestige objects , " such as highways and airports , to more environmentally friendly means of transportation . " cuts should not be being made to local public transportation , " she said , adding that the government had passed a law to slash mass transport funding by a total of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- over three years . the key lies in finding a balance between promoting business and protecting the environment , theunissen said . " the only way germany is going to be able to move forward is when it is clear that both issues need to be developed , " she said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister demands stricter safety standards for nuclear reactors germany 's environment minister wants higher safety standards at nuclear plants and has ruled out extending life spans for older reactors .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .
" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .
" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .
they offer advice and information , increasingly on the internet , since the medium is now integral as a way of making sexual contacts .
and they demand that the pharmaceutical industry revert to advertising which shows hiv as the life-threatening disease it is . experts believe that germans are generally well-informed about aids . but every generation of young people has to be educated again . it 's an endless task . immigrants in germany at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants are less likely to go for testing in germany but one of the most worrying developments centers on the immigrant populations living in germany .
ulrich heide of the german aids foundation says a lot of the education and information they supply simply misses this section of the population . heide points to a current study by the health ministry which shows that people from immigrant backgrounds living in germany know much less about hiv and aids than germans but there are some sectors of the immigrant population which arrive with basic information on the disease . " interestingly enough , people from sub-saharan africa are better informed that people from eastern and southern europe , " heide said .
" that 's evidently because the africans bring their knowledge with them from their homelands . " spreading the word , not the virus once in germany , migrants learn almost nothing more about aids because they are frightened of visiting the counseling centers . german aids support is trying to train counselors who speak the languages of the immigrant groups , so that they can deal with the subject in a way which is sensitive to their cultural needs , and , that way , make better contact with the people who are affected . in that way , one of the most " at risk " groups will get the information they need to protect themselves and others . michael ramirez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hiv infections on the rise new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2006 sluggish implementation plagues german environmental policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany looked in the environmentally friendly direction , then changed course germany 's grand coalition put the right ideas on paper but has been slow in getting results and too willing to compromise on key issues , according to the country 's environmental groups . just under one year ago , when germany 's two largest political parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , were forced into a grand coalition , they put their names on an agreement that sent a positive signal to environmental groups . " the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .
but environment groups worry about calls from other ruling coalition members to re-examine the topic . " there are continually new attempts to re-open this issue , " theunissen said .
" it needs to be made clear that there is no option other than putting an end to the use of nuclear energy . " nabu had also hoped that a common environmental policy , an issue merkel herself promoted , would not fall victim to germany 's recent federalism reform and leave the country 's 16 states to decide on their own environmental regulations , theunissen added . " it is like a starting signal for ecological dumping , " she said of the reform that could go into effect in 2010 .
" when every state can make its own laws and exceptions , it is questionable a common environmental policy is possible . " economy comes before environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plants account for a large amount of greenhouse gasses matthias seiche of friends for the earth germany -lrb- bund -rrb- criticized the government for putting business interests ahead of environmental protection and cited the example of the number of free european union emissions trading certificates gabriel 's ministry has awarded . " after taking office and saying the problem of climate change has been taken too lightly , he put the interests of the coal lobby first by giving power plant operators building new coal plants more than double as many free emission rights as he did for those building modern gas plants , " seiche said . both environmental groups also criticized the automobile industry 's ability to influence legislation . " the eu mandated a labeling system for fuel use in cars that the auto industry did not want , but the eu made it mandatory , " seiche said .
" what we ended up with was a minimal consensus that in many cases , but not all , requires co2 rates to be marked . " balancing interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public transport should get priority over new highways , theunissen said nabu 's theunissen added that the government needed to shift its focus from building " prestige objects , " such as highways and airports , to more environmentally friendly means of transportation . " cuts should not be being made to local public transportation , " she said , adding that the government had passed a law to slash mass transport funding by a total of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- over three years . the key lies in finding a balance between promoting business and protecting the environment , theunissen said . " the only way germany is going to be able to move forward is when it is clear that both issues need to be developed , " she said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister demands stricter safety standards for nuclear reactors germany 's environment minister wants higher safety standards at nuclear plants and has ruled out extending life spans for older reactors .

" the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .
but environment groups worry about calls from other ruling coalition members to re-examine the topic . " there are continually new attempts to re-open this issue , " theunissen said .
" it needs to be made clear that there is no option other than putting an end to the use of nuclear energy . " nabu had also hoped that a common environmental policy , an issue merkel herself promoted , would not fall victim to germany 's recent federalism reform and leave the country 's 16 states to decide on their own environmental regulations , theunissen added .

" the rules of the deployment are expected to be worked out in the next few days , " merkel said . merkel added that contributing to a future peace mission in lebanon was " in germany 's fundamental interests .

" the rules of the deployment are expected to be worked out in the next few days , " merkel said . merkel added that contributing to a future peace mission in lebanon was " in germany 's fundamental interests . "
to forego the opportunity , citing events in the middle east as " too complicated , " would " cost germany massively in terms of international influence , " she said . merkel needs the support of parliament and coalition ministers from her christian democrats and from the social democrats to approve military help in lebanon . merkel rules out syrian border patrol the chancellor ruled out a proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to send german police to safeguard lebanon 's border with syria .
police federation groups rejected the plan , saying they are not equipped or trained for military service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy frigates are likely to be deployed merkel also indicated she foresaw sending a german navy hospital ship to treat injured civilians .
the defense ministry said such a ship would be available immediately . the german navy already has a presence in the region , participating in operation active endeavour , which was launched in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , to monitor ships and escort non-military vessels through the straits of gibraltar . german naval force to patrol lebanese coast german un ambassador thomas matussek speaking in new york on thursday said : " today i was in a position to offer a rather substantive maritime component which is so encompassing that it could patrol and secure the whole of the lebanese coast to make sure that no weapons or other related materials get into lebanon . " the united nations , meeting in new york to try to thrash out the make-up of the expanded peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern lebanon after a month of deadly conflict between israel and hezbollah , outlined a " robust " mandate for thousands of international peacekeepers to be deployed and called on member states to pledge troops to secure the ceasefire which has tentatively held now for four days following a month of fierce fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un members are close to agreeing on a lebanon force matussek said nearly all the delegations speaking at the closed-door meeting had offered troops for the force .
" if i add it up , i think we are almost there , " he said .
ten to 15 delegations had made some sort of commitment to the force , he said .
germany , however , would not be one of those contributing combat troops to the lebanon force . germany has about 7,700 military personnel serving abroad , including in the mediterranean sea and off the horn of africa .
the army 's budget , amounting this year to 23.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.5 billion -rrb- , has remained static in real terms since 2002 . steinmeier considers syrian dialogue meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he was still open to talks with syria , two days after canceling a visit because president bashar al-assad described israel as " an enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier told deutschlandfunk radio that he held out hope syria could play a constructive role in working toward a lasting peace between israel and the hezbollah militia but said damascus must show it is willing . " i explained my decision , which was the only one i could make , to the syrian foreign minister and told him that my position remained unchanged that we have grounds and an opportunity to draw syria into a constructive role in the stabilization process " of lebanon , steinmeier said . " i am unsatisfied with the fact that what i had planned and what i consider to be right - integrating syria into the process - did not succeed .
that is why i told my colleague we are ready for dialogue but not at any cost . " steinmeier had been due to arrive in syria on tuesday evening and hold talks with assad the following day as part of a tour that also took in jordan and saudi arabia .
the trip was intended to urge regional powers to foster a lasting peace in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad assad had said in a wide-ranging speech that it was an honor for syria to support the shiite muslim hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier told deutschlandfunk that assad 's remarks had left him with no other choice than to cancel the visit .
" what we need is verbal disarmament and we need contributions to the stabilization of a still fragile truce .
what we surely do not need are calls to resistance against all those who attempt to secure this ceasefire .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .
" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .

in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .

they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2006 opinion : germany 's new vulnerability in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot , eldad beck , welcomes germany 's involvement in the middle east conflict .
but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

" the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .
but environment groups worry about calls from other ruling coalition members to re-examine the topic . " there are continually new attempts to re-open this issue , " theunissen said .
" it needs to be made clear that there is no option other than putting an end to the use of nuclear energy . " nabu had also hoped that a common environmental policy , an issue merkel herself promoted , would not fall victim to germany 's recent federalism reform and leave the country 's 16 states to decide on their own environmental regulations , theunissen added . " it is like a starting signal for ecological dumping , " she said of the reform that could go into effect in 2010 .
" when every state can make its own laws and exceptions , it is questionable a common environmental policy is possible . " economy comes before environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plants account for a large amount of greenhouse gasses matthias seiche of friends for the earth germany -lrb- bund -rrb- criticized the government for putting business interests ahead of environmental protection and cited the example of the number of free european union emissions trading certificates gabriel 's ministry has awarded . " after taking office and saying the problem of climate change has been taken too lightly , he put the interests of the coal lobby first by giving power plant operators building new coal plants more than double as many free emission rights as he did for those building modern gas plants , " seiche said . both environmental groups also criticized the automobile industry 's ability to influence legislation . " the eu mandated a labeling system for fuel use in cars that the auto industry did not want , but the eu made it mandatory , " seiche said .
" what we ended up with was a minimal consensus that in many cases , but not all , requires co2 rates to be marked . " balancing interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public transport should get priority over new highways , theunissen said nabu 's theunissen added that the government needed to shift its focus from building " prestige objects , " such as highways and airports , to more environmentally friendly means of transportation . " cuts should not be being made to local public transportation , " she said , adding that the government had passed a law to slash mass transport funding by a total of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- over three years . the key lies in finding a balance between promoting business and protecting the environment , theunissen said . " the only way germany is going to be able to move forward is when it is clear that both issues need to be developed , " she said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister demands stricter safety standards for nuclear reactors germany 's environment minister wants higher safety standards at nuclear plants and has ruled out extending life spans for older reactors .

" the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .
but environment groups worry about calls from other ruling coalition members to re-examine the topic . " there are continually new attempts to re-open this issue , " theunissen said .
" it needs to be made clear that there is no option other than putting an end to the use of nuclear energy . " nabu had also hoped that a common environmental policy , an issue merkel herself promoted , would not fall victim to germany 's recent federalism reform and leave the country 's 16 states to decide on their own environmental regulations , theunissen added . " it is like a starting signal for ecological dumping , " she said of the reform that could go into effect in 2010 .
" when every state can make its own laws and exceptions , it is questionable a common environmental policy is possible . " economy comes before environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plants account for a large amount of greenhouse gasses matthias seiche of friends for the earth germany -lrb- bund -rrb- criticized the government for putting business interests ahead of environmental protection and cited the example of the number of free european union emissions trading certificates gabriel 's ministry has awarded . " after taking office and saying the problem of climate change has been taken too lightly , he put the interests of the coal lobby first by giving power plant operators building new coal plants more than double as many free emission rights as he did for those building modern gas plants , " seiche said . both environmental groups also criticized the automobile industry 's ability to influence legislation . " the eu mandated a labeling system for fuel use in cars that the auto industry did not want , but the eu made it mandatory , " seiche said .
" what we ended up with was a minimal consensus that in many cases , but not all , requires co2 rates to be marked .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

so far it has received solid pledges of 3,500 soldiers , up to 2,000 of whom be coming from bangladesh , according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1,500 french troops would stay in the region , but under french control , chirac said french president jacques chirac announced late on thursday that france was ready to contribute a total of 400 additional troops to help shore up a fragile truce now in its fifth day - far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . " we had hoped - we make no secret of it - that there would be a stronger french contribution , " said mark malloch brown , un deputy secretary general .
" others have come forward and we are pretty convinced we 've got the elements here of a strong force . " clarifying the rules of engagement germany ruled out contributing ground troops but proposed sending a " maritime protection component " with its navy taking part in the future deployment , saying any moves hinged on the establishment of clear rules of engagement .
denmark also pledged to patrol the mediterranean ocean . with its troops tied down in iraq , london promised that while it would take part in the peacekeeping force , its contribution would come in the form of air and sea support and not ground troops , according to emyr jones parry , great britain 's un 's ambassador . the focus has now moved to italy , spain and belgium , which can move forces to lebanon quickly to meet the un 's own 15-day deadline for an immediate deployment of 3,500 soldiers with the rest of the force in place by nov .
4 . many " interesting offers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peacekeepers will bolster 15,000 lebanese troops being sent to the israeli border italy has said it could quickly send as many as 3,000 soldiers - up from its current contribution of about 50 - but italian prime minister romano prodi 's office said it , like the other nations , was pushing for explicit ground rules . " the draft rules of engagement call for the use of force to prevent the -lrb- un forces in lebanon -rrb- area of deployment and operations from being used to hostile activities , " brown said . indonesia , malaysia and nepal , among others , offered ground troops , participants at the meeting told reuters . barracks and hospitals were offered by cyprus , which also said it could serve as a regional transit hub , and the united states said it would provide planning and logistics capabilities . " we 've had a lot of interesting offers , some fairly firm , some conditional on seeing the rules of engagement and the concept of operations , " he added .
" the show 's on the road , but there 's a lot of work to be done in the coming days . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany not likely to send ground troops to middle east german defense minister franz-josef jung said on thursday that the country 's contribution to an international peacekeeping contingent would likely be naval forces and not land-based soldiers .

" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2006 opinion : germany 's new vulnerability in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot , eldad beck , welcomes germany 's involvement in the middle east conflict .
but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

but , he warns , the price for that could be high . during the fighting between the israeli army and the hezbollah militia in lebanon , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier embarked on a diplomatic initiative which surprised many in the middle east .
in an interview in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , steinmeier talked about the necessity of syrian involvement in an eventual solution to the latest crisis in lebanon . " syria is too important a region player to be left out of the loop in the long run , " said steinmeier .
" while i can understand that seeing things in black and white in foreign policy may be attractive , i 've learned that the entire color spectrum is more representative of the state of affairs .
we should continue to express out criticism of syria 's internal affairs , but we should also see if syria really wants to bind itself to iran for the long term .
i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .
" the next generation will find a way to force israel to capitulate . "
he praised hezbollah and declared : " to those who accuse syria of supporting hezbollah , we respond by saying that that is a great honor and a medal on the chest of every arab . " business sometimes paramount many politicians around the globe often become prisoners of their own positions and ideas .
the german foreign minister has shown himself to be an exception .
he reacted to the " resistance speech " by the syrian president by immediately canceling his planned trip to damascus .
steinmeier has not given up his idea of bringing syria into the international peace process , but he wo n't do it at any price . if germany begins taking on a bigger role in the middle east in the hopes of contributing to a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the reaction of the foreign minister is very significant .
for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality . "
but germany 's playing a more important role in the region makes it more vulnerable .
at some point it 's going to be necessary to show one 's colors .
mr. steinmeier is right if he thinks that one has to look at the region 's entire complicated spectrum .
the situation , especially in lebanon , is very complex .
so complex , in fact , that it is only those ready to die with a clean conscience or murder tens of thousands of innocents - as in the case of syria and its proxies - who have succeeded in establishing a rule of terror in lebanon . hezbollah now refuses to lay down its arms .
iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .
at the same time , iran finds itself at odds with the international community over its nuclear program .
what would happen if tehran decides to put hezbollah in action against un troops , as has happened in the past ?
according to various sources , iran is cooperating with al qaeda , which has conducted a global war against the west for years now .
with iran 's help , lebanon could become a new front in that war .
the situation in southern lebanon is such that the dynamic could change at any time and international troops there could become a party in the conflict .
is germany ready for such an eventuality ?
israel is fighting for its very existence in this highly explosive context .
is germany really ready to bear the consequences of its verbal commitment to israel 's right to exist . to do something good for world peace is a highly admirable and even intelligent position .
but rationality is often something very different from political reality , especially in the east .
the romans used to say : to achieve peace , man should always be ready for war .
one can not rule out the possibility that the defense of certain values in the middle east will come with a high price .
however , one can always hope that , one day , reason will prevail in the region - the earlier , the better .
if the germans want to go down the path of greater involvement there , despite all the risks that will come with it , one should wish them the very best of luck . eldad beck is germany correspondent for the israeli newspaper yedioth ahronot -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's mideast stance ignores german-arab ties germany 's generally pro-israel stance in the current middle east conflict jeopardizes its relations to the arab world , according to dw-world.de 's ibrahim mohamad .

i will engage with syria to show them there is a way to be a constructive partner in the peace process , rather than a hindrance to rapprochement . " western logic vs. mideast politics minister steinmeier was correct in thinking that israel 's offensive in lebanon and the weakening of hezbollah , the islamic militia supported by damascus and tehran , could be the start of a political process that might bring syria around .
however , western logic has little to do with political thinking in the middle east . the last war in lebanon was seen by many in the region not as a superfluous stage of a long , destructive conflict that , at the end of the day , served no purpose .
rather , many considered it an important step toward israel 's eventual destruction .
the syrian president , bashar al-assad , expressed a similar opinion in a speech that he gave on august 15 in damascus in front of a gathering of syrian journalists . " the peace process has been a failure and is dead , " said al-assad .

for years , germany took great efforts not to offend the sensibilities of the parties involved in the conflict .
the opinion that germany has always been on the side of the israelis is incorrect .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , when israel 's very existence was threatened , the government of west germany , under willy brandt , did not allow weapon deliveries from the us to israel to be transported through germany on the ground or in the air .
for decades , the east german government generously supported arabic terrorism against israel . germany 's position toward middle eastern affairs has not always been an objective one , and not always in israel 's favor .
germany has many business interests in the region , and many arabic and muslim countries offer more lucrative business opportunities than israel does .
that fact has sometimes influenced german policy in the middle east more than any historically motivated feeling of responsibility toward israel . rule of terror in lebanon as long as germany did n't strive for a larger role in the region , the parties in the middle east conflict were able to live with german " neutrality .

iran , for its part , sees a " zionistic protection force " in the un troops that are to be stationed in southern lebanon .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .
" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .
they offer advice and information , increasingly on the internet , since the medium is now integral as a way of making sexual contacts .
and they demand that the pharmaceutical industry revert to advertising which shows hiv as the life-threatening disease it is . experts believe that germans are generally well-informed about aids . but every generation of young people has to be educated again . it 's an endless task . immigrants in germany at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants are less likely to go for testing in germany but one of the most worrying developments centers on the immigrant populations living in germany .
ulrich heide of the german aids foundation says a lot of the education and information they supply simply misses this section of the population . heide points to a current study by the health ministry which shows that people from immigrant backgrounds living in germany know much less about hiv and aids than germans but there are some sectors of the immigrant population which arrive with basic information on the disease . " interestingly enough , people from sub-saharan africa are better informed that people from eastern and southern europe , " heide said .
" that 's evidently because the africans bring their knowledge with them from their homelands . " spreading the word , not the virus once in germany , migrants learn almost nothing more about aids because they are frightened of visiting the counseling centers . german aids support is trying to train counselors who speak the languages of the immigrant groups , so that they can deal with the subject in a way which is sensitive to their cultural needs , and , that way , make better contact with the people who are affected . in that way , one of the most " at risk " groups will get the information they need to protect themselves and others . michael ramirez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hiv infections on the rise new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .
" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .
they offer advice and information , increasingly on the internet , since the medium is now integral as a way of making sexual contacts .
and they demand that the pharmaceutical industry revert to advertising which shows hiv as the life-threatening disease it is . experts believe that germans are generally well-informed about aids . but every generation of young people has to be educated again . it 's an endless task . immigrants in germany at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants are less likely to go for testing in germany but one of the most worrying developments centers on the immigrant populations living in germany .
ulrich heide of the german aids foundation says a lot of the education and information they supply simply misses this section of the population . heide points to a current study by the health ministry which shows that people from immigrant backgrounds living in germany know much less about hiv and aids than germans but there are some sectors of the immigrant population which arrive with basic information on the disease . " interestingly enough , people from sub-saharan africa are better informed that people from eastern and southern europe , " heide said .
" that 's evidently because the africans bring their knowledge with them from their homelands . " spreading the word , not the virus once in germany , migrants learn almost nothing more about aids because they are frightened of visiting the counseling centers . german aids support is trying to train counselors who speak the languages of the immigrant groups , so that they can deal with the subject in a way which is sensitive to their cultural needs , and , that way , make better contact with the people who are affected . in that way , one of the most " at risk " groups will get the information they need to protect themselves and others . michael ramirez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hiv infections on the rise new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase .

25 , 2005 -rrb- rising aids cases spur new campaign german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .

risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids .

" the rules of the deployment are expected to be worked out in the next few days , " merkel said . merkel added that contributing to a future peace mission in lebanon was " in germany 's fundamental interests . "
to forego the opportunity , citing events in the middle east as " too complicated , " would " cost germany massively in terms of international influence , " she said . merkel needs the support of parliament and coalition ministers from her christian democrats and from the social democrats to approve military help in lebanon . merkel rules out syrian border patrol the chancellor ruled out a proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to send german police to safeguard lebanon 's border with syria .
police federation groups rejected the plan , saying they are not equipped or trained for military service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy frigates are likely to be deployed merkel also indicated she foresaw sending a german navy hospital ship to treat injured civilians .
the defense ministry said such a ship would be available immediately . the german navy already has a presence in the region , participating in operation active endeavour , which was launched in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , to monitor ships and escort non-military vessels through the straits of gibraltar . german naval force to patrol lebanese coast german un ambassador thomas matussek speaking in new york on thursday said : " today i was in a position to offer a rather substantive maritime component which is so encompassing that it could patrol and secure the whole of the lebanese coast to make sure that no weapons or other related materials get into lebanon . " the united nations , meeting in new york to try to thrash out the make-up of the expanded peacekeeping force to be deployed in southern lebanon after a month of deadly conflict between israel and hezbollah , outlined a " robust " mandate for thousands of international peacekeepers to be deployed and called on member states to pledge troops to secure the ceasefire which has tentatively held now for four days following a month of fierce fighting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un members are close to agreeing on a lebanon force matussek said nearly all the delegations speaking at the closed-door meeting had offered troops for the force .
" if i add it up , i think we are almost there , " he said .
ten to 15 delegations had made some sort of commitment to the force , he said .
germany , however , would not be one of those contributing combat troops to the lebanon force . germany has about 7,700 military personnel serving abroad , including in the mediterranean sea and off the horn of africa .
the army 's budget , amounting this year to 23.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 30.5 billion -rrb- , has remained static in real terms since 2002 . steinmeier considers syrian dialogue meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday he was still open to talks with syria , two days after canceling a visit because president bashar al-assad described israel as " an enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier told deutschlandfunk radio that he held out hope syria could play a constructive role in working toward a lasting peace between israel and the hezbollah militia but said damascus must show it is willing . " i explained my decision , which was the only one i could make , to the syrian foreign minister and told him that my position remained unchanged that we have grounds and an opportunity to draw syria into a constructive role in the stabilization process " of lebanon , steinmeier said . " i am unsatisfied with the fact that what i had planned and what i consider to be right - integrating syria into the process - did not succeed .
that is why i told my colleague we are ready for dialogue but not at any cost . " steinmeier had been due to arrive in syria on tuesday evening and hold talks with assad the following day as part of a tour that also took in jordan and saudi arabia .
the trip was intended to urge regional powers to foster a lasting peace in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad assad had said in a wide-ranging speech that it was an honor for syria to support the shiite muslim hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . steinmeier told deutschlandfunk that assad 's remarks had left him with no other choice than to cancel the visit .
" what we need is verbal disarmament and we need contributions to the stabilization of a still fragile truce .

so far it has received solid pledges of 3,500 soldiers , up to 2,000 of whom be coming from bangladesh , according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1,500 french troops would stay in the region , but under french control , chirac said french president jacques chirac announced late on thursday that france was ready to contribute a total of 400 additional troops to help shore up a fragile truce now in its fifth day - far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . " we had hoped - we make no secret of it - that there would be a stronger french contribution , " said mark malloch brown , un deputy secretary general .
" others have come forward and we are pretty convinced we 've got the elements here of a strong force . " clarifying the rules of engagement germany ruled out contributing ground troops but proposed sending a " maritime protection component " with its navy taking part in the future deployment , saying any moves hinged on the establishment of clear rules of engagement .
denmark also pledged to patrol the mediterranean ocean . with its troops tied down in iraq , london promised that while it would take part in the peacekeeping force , its contribution would come in the form of air and sea support and not ground troops , according to emyr jones parry , great britain 's un 's ambassador . the focus has now moved to italy , spain and belgium , which can move forces to lebanon quickly to meet the un 's own 15-day deadline for an immediate deployment of 3,500 soldiers with the rest of the force in place by nov .
4 . many " interesting offers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peacekeepers will bolster 15,000 lebanese troops being sent to the israeli border italy has said it could quickly send as many as 3,000 soldiers - up from its current contribution of about 50 - but italian prime minister romano prodi 's office said it , like the other nations , was pushing for explicit ground rules . " the draft rules of engagement call for the use of force to prevent the -lrb- un forces in lebanon -rrb- area of deployment and operations from being used to hostile activities , " brown said . indonesia , malaysia and nepal , among others , offered ground troops , participants at the meeting told reuters . barracks and hospitals were offered by cyprus , which also said it could serve as a regional transit hub , and the united states said it would provide planning and logistics capabilities . " we 've had a lot of interesting offers , some fairly firm , some conditional on seeing the rules of engagement and the concept of operations , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2006 apathy and false security lead to rise in german hiv cases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts fear that the message of aids awareness is falling on deaf ears as experts attend the international aids conference in toronto this week , german organizations are working hard to stop the worrying increase in hiv cases at home . the news is depressing .
the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .
" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .
they offer advice and information , increasingly on the internet , since the medium is now integral as a way of making sexual contacts .
and they demand that the pharmaceutical industry revert to advertising which shows hiv as the life-threatening disease it is . experts believe that germans are generally well-informed about aids . but every generation of young people has to be educated again . it 's an endless task . immigrants in germany at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants are less likely to go for testing in germany but one of the most worrying developments centers on the immigrant populations living in germany .
ulrich heide of the german aids foundation says a lot of the education and information they supply simply misses this section of the population . heide points to a current study by the health ministry which shows that people from immigrant backgrounds living in germany know much less about hiv and aids than germans but there are some sectors of the immigrant population which arrive with basic information on the disease . " interestingly enough , people from sub-saharan africa are better informed that people from eastern and southern europe , " heide said .
" that 's evidently because the africans bring their knowledge with them from their homelands . " spreading the word , not the virus once in germany , migrants learn almost nothing more about aids because they are frightened of visiting the counseling centers . german aids support is trying to train counselors who speak the languages of the immigrant groups , so that they can deal with the subject in a way which is sensitive to their cultural needs , and , that way , make better contact with the people who are affected . in that way , one of the most " at risk " groups will get the information they need to protect themselves and others . michael ramirez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hiv infections on the rise new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase .

the number of new hiv infections around the world has been rising for five years .
in the first half of 2005 , there were 20 percent more cases than in the first half of 2004 . in germany , there are now 45,000 people infected with hiv .
every year the number goes up by 2,000 .
in the last few years , the increase has gained in pace , as people start to believe they are less at risk . according to sven christian finke of the german aids support organization , another reason is that people notice that there are advertising campaigns by pharmaceutical companies in which hiv is seen almost as something which gives meaning to life . " that way the consequences of an infection are understated . that has an effect on the public and some of their target groups have changed their sense of the risk , " finke said . it 's true that aids can be much better treated than it was in the early days of the disease . that 's one of the positives . but on the negative side , says elisabeth pott , director of the federal centre for health information , people have stopped worrying . real nature of hiv must not be forgotten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non explicit anti-aids advertising is failing " one must n't forget : the fact that the disease is now treatable , or at it is now treated better , is certainly not the same as being able to cure it , " pott said .
" what it actually means is living a life accompanied by the side effects of medicine , a life with limitations and with increasingly frequent periods of illness . " aids can not be cured , and unprotected sex with unknown partners is dangerous . that 's what the experts keep repeating .
they train counselors for advice centers and send them out to places where gay people or drug users gather .
they offer advice and information , increasingly on the internet , since the medium is now integral as a way of making sexual contacts .
and they demand that the pharmaceutical industry revert to advertising which shows hiv as the life-threatening disease it is . experts believe that germans are generally well-informed about aids . but every generation of young people has to be educated again . it 's an endless task . immigrants in germany at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants are less likely to go for testing in germany but one of the most worrying developments centers on the immigrant populations living in germany .
ulrich heide of the german aids foundation says a lot of the education and information they supply simply misses this section of the population . heide points to a current study by the health ministry which shows that people from immigrant backgrounds living in germany know much less about hiv and aids than germans but there are some sectors of the immigrant population which arrive with basic information on the disease . " interestingly enough , people from sub-saharan africa are better informed that people from eastern and southern europe , " heide said .
" that 's evidently because the africans bring their knowledge with them from their homelands . " spreading the word , not the virus once in germany , migrants learn almost nothing more about aids because they are frightened of visiting the counseling centers . german aids support is trying to train counselors who speak the languages of the immigrant groups , so that they can deal with the subject in a way which is sensitive to their cultural needs , and , that way , make better contact with the people who are affected . in that way , one of the most " at risk " groups will get the information they need to protect themselves and others . michael ramirez -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hiv infections on the rise new cases of hiv rose in germany this year with health officials saying that drug cocktails to fight the disease are contributing to the increase .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2006 sluggish implementation plagues german environmental policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany looked in the environmentally friendly direction , then changed course germany 's grand coalition put the right ideas on paper but has been slow in getting results and too willing to compromise on key issues , according to the country 's environmental groups . just under one year ago , when germany 's two largest political parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , were forced into a grand coalition , they put their names on an agreement that sent a positive signal to environmental groups . " the coalition set a series of good goals but has stagnated when it comes to putting them in place , " said johanna theunissen of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu -rrb- .
" protecting the climate needs to be the primary goal in every political area . " the parties agreed to putting an end to nuclear energy use , reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a single book of environmental law that would apply to all of germany 's 16 states , but each of these topics has been set back , theunissen said . nabu , as well as other german environmental groups , are concerned that members of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu are apparently anxious to prolong nuclear energy use and that a reform of germany 's federal system has called a common environmental policy into question . germany 's 16 sets of environmental regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every community makes its own rules when it comes to dealing with trash environment minister sigmar gabriel has insisted the government will continue the policy of phasing out nuclear power plants put in place by the previous spd-green party administration .
but environment groups worry about calls from other ruling coalition members to re-examine the topic . " there are continually new attempts to re-open this issue , " theunissen said .
" it needs to be made clear that there is no option other than putting an end to the use of nuclear energy . " nabu had also hoped that a common environmental policy , an issue merkel herself promoted , would not fall victim to germany 's recent federalism reform and leave the country 's 16 states to decide on their own environmental regulations , theunissen added . " it is like a starting signal for ecological dumping , " she said of the reform that could go into effect in 2010 .

" after taking office and saying the problem of climate change has been taken too lightly , he put the interests of the coal lobby first by giving power plant operators building new coal plants more than double as many free emission rights as he did for those building modern gas plants , " seiche said . both environmental groups also criticized the automobile industry 's ability to influence legislation . " the eu mandated a labeling system for fuel use in cars that the auto industry did not want , but the eu made it mandatory , " seiche said .

talks are under way about removing emergency care from hospitals in london , surrey , sussex , greater manchester , lancashire and cornwall .
the sites will either close or be left to handle basic care , with " super " regional centres seeing the most ill .
nhs bosses say the measures are aimed at reducing deficits and treating more patients in the community . "
in some areas , there are too many hospitals providing the same or similar services " department of health spokesman shape of healthcare to come q & a : hospitals under threat but there are concerns people will have to travel miles for life-saving treatment .
george beer , of the british cardiac patients association , who is campaigning against changes to hospital services in sussex , said : " if services are closed , severely ill patients will have to travel miles for care .
it is putting lives at risk . "
further evidence of the move to centralised services at certain hospitals will emerge on friday with the unveiling of six new pfi schemes .
the projects , worth a combined £ 1.5bn , include expanding a & e facilities in hospitals in salford and leicester and building a cancer centre in north staffordshire .
the schemes do not cover any of the trusts identified in the bbc news investigation .
community care some of the options being drawn up by those trusts which are looking to cut services involve transferring all acute care - accident and emergency departments , heart care units and critical care beds - to nearby hospitals to create regional " super " centres .
the other hospitals in the area will then be left to carry out more basic care , such as non-emergency surgery , diagnostics and rehabilitation care , such as physiotherapy .
but in some cases , whole hospital closures are being considered .
over 30 hospitals could be affected by the reviews - including those losing services and others left to bear the brunt of that work .
it is thought about 10 of these could face cuts or closures .
the areas under review are : london - talks under way over harrow 's northwick park and the nearby central middlesex hospitals project board set up to review services across the four north central trusts - barnet and chase farm , royal free , whittington and north middlesex surrey and sussex - widespread discussions have been followed by the creation of focus groups to discuss future of the 15 hospitals run by nine nhs trusts .
formal consultation to start in the autumn greater manchester - committee set up to decide the future of four hospitals run by the pennine acute hospitals nhs trust .
decision due end of september lancashire - changes to the university hospitals of morecambe bay trust 's three centres - spread across cumbria and lancashire , planned , with the westmorland threatened with losing its acute facilities cornwall - two proposals have been discussed by royal cornwall hospitals nhs trust , one of which involves withdrawing services from two of its three hospitals nhs bosses involved in the reviews have said the measures are part of a push to provide more care in the community , either with hospital doctors setting up local clinics , gps providing extra specialist services or medics treating patients in their own homes .
however , they also acknowledge deficits and new european working time restrictions are forcing them to reconsider how services are provided .
' locality hospitals ' all the hospitals in surrey and sussex , which is overspending by £ 100m a year , are under review , while talks are in the early stages over five north london trusts and the royal cornwall hospitals trust . "
in some of these cases we have to ask whether this is being driven by financial reasons " dr jonathan fielden , british medical association go-ahead for pfi hospitals a consultation has already been launched in morecambe bay to decide over the future of three local hospitals - the westmorland could lose acute services as part of the review .
but a decision is closest on the four hospitals run by the pennine acute hospitals trust , which is facing a £ 21m deficit this year , with a committee of local health bosses expected to make an announcement by the end of september .
three options were consulted on , ranging from keeping three acute hospitals to just one , with the remainder becoming " locality hospitals " providing planned surgery and intermediate care .
there are 175 acute hospital trusts in england -and it is possible that more areas will see hospitals downgraded or closed .
deficits government ministers are said to be privately bracing themselves for major hospitals to be affected in the coming months as part of the continued pressure on the health service from deficits - the nhs finished last year over £ 500m in debt .
but , in an official statement , a department of health spokesman said it was up to local health bosses to decide on the appropriate level of services .
" in some areas , there are too many hospitals providing the same or similar services which is n't value for money and means less resources for other forms of health care . "
nigel edwards , director of policy at the nhs confederation , which represents health trusts , said : " one of the reasons trusts are running up deficits is that these decisions were not made earlier .
it makes sense to do more care in the community for clinical and financial reasons . "
but he said he was concerned acute care could end up centralised in too few hospitals .
dr jonathan fielden , deputy chairman of the british medical association 's consultants committee , added : " in some of these cases we have to ask whether this is being driven by financial reasons .
" if this is the case , it is likely not to be in the best interests of patients . "

talks are under way about removing emergency care from hospitals in london , surrey , sussex , greater manchester , lancashire and cornwall .
the sites will either close or be left to handle basic care , with " super " regional centres seeing the most ill .
nhs bosses say the measures are aimed at reducing deficits and treating more patients in the community .
in some areas , there are too many hospitals providing the same or similar services department of health spokesman shape of healthcare to come q & a : hospitals under threat but there are concerns people will have to travel miles for life-saving treatment .
george beer , of the british cardiac patients association , who is campaigning against changes to hospital services in sussex , said : " if services are closed , severely ill patients will have to travel miles for care .
it is putting lives at risk . "
further evidence of the move to centralised services at certain hospitals will emerge on friday with the unveiling of six new pfi schemes .
the projects , worth a combined £ 1.5bn , include expanding a & e facilities in hospitals in salford and leicester and building a cancer centre in north staffordshire .
the schemes do not cover any of the trusts identified in the bbc news investigation .
community care some of the options being drawn up by those trusts which are looking to cut services involve transferring all acute care - accident and emergency departments , heart care units and critical care beds - to nearby hospitals to create regional " super " centres .
the other hospitals in the area will then be left to carry out more basic care , such as non-emergency surgery , diagnostics and rehabilitation care , such as physiotherapy .
but in some cases , whole hospital closures are being considered .
over 30 hospitals could be affected by the reviews - including those losing services and others left to bear the brunt of that work .
it is thought about 10 of these could face cuts or closures .
the areas under review are : london - talks under way over harrow 's northwick park and the nearby central middlesex hospitals project board set up to review services across the four north central trusts - barnet and chase farm , royal free , whittington and north middlesex surrey and sussex - widespread discussions have been followed by the creation of focus groups to discuss future of the 15 hospitals run by nine nhs trusts .
formal consultation to start in the autumn greater manchester - committee set up to decide the future of four hospitals run by the pennine acute hospitals nhs trust .
decision due end of september lancashire - changes to the university hospitals of morecambe bay trust 's three centres - spread across cumbria and lancashire , planned , with the westmorland threatened with losing its acute facilities cornwall - two proposals have been discussed by royal cornwall hospitals nhs trust , one of which involves withdrawing services from two of its three hospitals nhs bosses involved in the reviews have said the measures are part of a push to provide more care in the community , either with hospital doctors setting up local clinics , gps providing extra specialist services or medics treating patients in their own homes .
however , they also acknowledge deficits and new european working time restrictions are forcing them to reconsider how services are provided .
' locality hospitals ' all the hospitals in surrey and sussex , which is overspending by £ 100m a year , are under review , while talks are in the early stages over five north london trusts and the royal cornwall hospitals trust .
in some of these cases we have to ask whether this is being driven by financial reasons dr jonathan fielden , british medical association go-ahead for pfi hospitals a consultation has already been launched in morecambe bay to decide over the future of three local hospitals - the westmorland could lose acute services as part of the review .
but a decision is closest on the four hospitals run by the pennine acute hospitals trust , which is facing a £ 21m deficit this year , with a committee of local health bosses expected to make an announcement by the end of september .
three options were consulted on , ranging from keeping three acute hospitals to just one , with the remainder becoming " locality hospitals " providing planned surgery and intermediate care .
there are 175 acute hospital trusts in england -and it is possible that more areas will see hospitals downgraded or closed .
deficits government ministers are said to be privately bracing themselves for major hospitals to be affected in the coming months as part of the continued pressure on the health service from deficits - the nhs finished last year over £ 500m in debt .
but , in an official statement , a department of health spokesman said it was up to local health bosses to decide on the appropriate level of services .
" in some areas , there are too many hospitals providing the same or similar services which is n't value for money and means less resources for other forms of health care . "
nigel edwards , director of policy at the nhs confederation , which represents health trusts , said : " one of the reasons trusts are running up deficits is that these decisions were not made earlier .
it makes sense to do more care in the community for clinical and financial reasons . "
but he said he was concerned acute care could end up centralised in too few hospitals .
dr jonathan fielden , deputy chairman of the british medical association 's consultants committee , added : " in some of these cases we have to ask whether this is being driven by financial reasons .
" if this is the case , it is likely not to be in the best interests of patients . "

professor wu yangfeng said that in the 15 years between 1985 and 2000 , the number of overweight and obese children increased 28-fold .
he made his comments in a special china edition of the british medical journal .
the edition also looks at the impact of china 's one child policy , the increase in chronic disease caused by smoking and lessons learned from sars .
growing problem china used to be seen as a country with a lean population , but not any more .
today a fifth of the world 's overweight and obese people live in china - and the numbers are rising dramatically .
professor wu yangfeng said this posed a considerable health problem , calling on the chinese authorities to act now to prevent further increase .
there seems to be a range of underlying causes - from changes in diet to reduced levels of exercise and a rapid increase in the use of cars .
one article in the special edition of the british medical journal looks at the impact of passive smoking on the health of chinese women .
that is seen as a particular problem because far more chinese men smoke than chinese women .
another looks at the long term impact of china 's one child policy .
despite some of the atrocities associated with it , says one editor , the bottom line is that there was pain for one generation but there is some gain for the next .
and on the sars crisis , the president of the chinese medical association says china has learnt important lessons - to be honest with the public about what was happening , for example , and to involve health professionals in developing policy .

professor wu yangfeng said that in the 15 years between 1985 and 2000 , the number of overweight and obese children increased 28-fold .
he made his comments in a special china edition of the british medical journal .
the edition also looks at the impact of china 's one child policy , the increase in chronic disease caused by smoking and lessons learned from sars .
growing problem china used to be seen as a country with a lean population , but not any more .
today a fifth of the world 's overweight and obese people live in china - and the numbers are rising dramatically .
professor wu yangfeng said this posed a considerable health problem , calling on the chinese authorities to act now to prevent further increase .
there seems to be a range of underlying causes - from changes in diet to reduced levels of exercise and a rapid increase in the use of cars .
one article in the special edition of the british medical journal looks at the impact of passive smoking on the health of chinese women .
that is seen as a particular problem because far more chinese men smoke than chinese women .
another looks at the long term impact of china 's one child policy .
despite some of the atrocities associated with it , says one editor , the bottom line is that there was pain for one generation but there is some gain for the next .
and on the sars crisis , the president of the chinese medical association says china has learnt important lessons - to be honest with the public about what was happening , for example , and to involve health professionals in developing policy .

what is the future for nhs care ?
sussex is just one of the areas under review pensioner george beer was among hundreds of people who took to the streets earlier this month .
he was part of a protest against potential closures of services at the local worthing and southlands hospital .
the hospital is one of 15 in surrey and sussex which is being reviewed by local health bosses .
no decisions have been taken , but the process is likely to lead to a reduction in the number of acute hospitals .
worthing , with its close proximity to brighton 's major hospitals , is thought to be one of the most vulnerable .
' fear ' mr beer , 77 , from nearby sompting and a representative of the british cardiac patients association , suffered a heart attack 12 years ago .
" my fear , if cuts are made , is that for someone who has a heart attack they will face a long trip to brighton .
" the journey can take three quarters of an hour .
that is too long for someone who needs help quickly .
" we have to do all we can to keep the hospital running with its excellent cardiac department . "
this view is echoed in other parts of the country .
bbc news has identified several areas where hospitals face an uncertain future , with almost all plans facing some form of local opposition .
people are increasingly being treated for long-term conditions and with good management these can be handled by gps , nurses and other health professionals working outside hospitals caroline hopper , primary care trust official major hospitals under threat q & a : hospitals under threat chris ham , professor of health policy at birmingham university and a former department of health adviser , said : " this is the battle the government and nhs faces .
" the public is extremely attached to local hospitals and is not about to let go .
" but in many cases , i think change is inevitable .
we do too much care in hospitals .
" there are good clinical reasons to increase care in the community . "
caroline hopper , a primary care trust official involved in the surrey and sussex review process , agreed .
" what we are trying to is to change how care is provided .
" people are increasingly being treated for long-term conditions and with good management these can be handled by gps , nurses and other health professionals working outside hospitals . "
statistics support the argument .
currently about 30 % of people in the uk have a long-term condition , such as heart disease , diabetes and asthma , and this is likely to increase as the population ages .
community people with long-term conditions account for around 60 % of acute hospital bed days , but doctors believe with better care many of these people would never need to be admitted to hospital .
the government set out a vision in january to provide more and better care in the community .
ministers said gps should set up specialist clinics to help treat and manage patients ' long-term conditions .
hospital consultants were also encouraged to set up clinics in the community , while multi-purpose local health centres could carry out minor surgery and care more associated with smaller hospitals .
the problem is that they want to push ahead with changes before they have good enough community facilities in place to cope bob lacey , tory councillor a department of health spokesman said : " patients say it 's a better service and it also means better value for money as the same procedure in primary care can be a third of the cost of one in secondary care . "
for more complex care , such as emergency surgery and specialist cardiac care , the government believes a smaller number of large , regional hospitals will provide better services than those on offer in traditional district general hospitals .
the most recent announcement about pfi funding illustrates the point .
some £ 1.5bn is being spent on strengthening a & e and cancer services at a number of large , specialist hospitals .
meanwhile , more cash is being handed over to community services and away from hospital budgets in coming years .
however , concerns remain .
bob lacey , a tory councillor on east sussex county council and chairman of a committee set up to scrutinise the changes being made in surrey and sussex , does not believe the infrastructure is yet in place to support a major reorganisation of services .
" the problem is that they want to push ahead with changes before they have good enough community facilities in place to cope . "

the hospital is one of 15 in surrey and sussex which is being reviewed by local health bosses .
no decisions have been taken , but the process is likely to lead to a reduction in the number of acute hospitals .
worthing , with its close proximity to brighton 's major hospitals , is thought to be one of the most vulnerable .
' fear ' mr beer , 77 , from nearby sompting and a representative of the british cardiac patients association , suffered a heart attack 12 years ago .
" my fear , if cuts are made , is that for someone who has a heart attack they will face a long trip to brighton .
" the journey can take three quarters of an hour .
that is too long for someone who needs help quickly .
" we have to do all we can to keep the hospital running with its excellent cardiac department . "
this view is echoed in other parts of the country .
bbc news has identified several areas where hospitals face an uncertain future , with almost all plans facing some form of local opposition .
people are increasingly being treated for long-term conditions and with good management these can be handled by gps , nurses and other health professionals working outside hospitals caroline hopper , primary care trust official major hospitals under threat q & a : hospitals under threat chris ham , professor of health policy at birmingham university and a former department of health adviser , said : " this is the battle the government and nhs faces .
" the public is extremely attached to local hospitals and is not about to let go .
" but in many cases , i think change is inevitable .
we do too much care in hospitals .
" there are good clinical reasons to increase care in the community . "
caroline hopper , a primary care trust official involved in the surrey and sussex review process , agreed .
" what we are trying to is to change how care is provided .
" people are increasingly being treated for long-term conditions and with good management these can be handled by gps , nurses and other health professionals working outside hospitals . "
statistics support the argument .
currently about 30 % of people in the uk have a long-term condition , such as heart disease , diabetes and asthma , and this is likely to increase as the population ages .
community people with long-term conditions account for around 60 % of acute hospital bed days , but doctors believe with better care many of these people would never need to be admitted to hospital .
the government set out a vision in january to provide more and better care in the community .
ministers said gps should set up specialist clinics to help treat and manage patients ' long-term conditions .
hospital consultants were also encouraged to set up clinics in the community , while multi-purpose local health centres could carry out minor surgery and care more associated with smaller hospitals .
the problem is that they want to push ahead with changes before they have good enough community facilities in place to cope bob lacey , tory councillor a department of health spokesman said : " patients say it 's a better service and it also means better value for money as the same procedure in primary care can be a third of the cost of one in secondary care . "
for more complex care , such as emergency surgery and specialist cardiac care , the government believes a smaller number of large , regional hospitals will provide better services than those on offer in traditional district general hospitals .
the most recent announcement about pfi funding illustrates the point .
some £ 1.5bn is being spent on strengthening a & e and cancer services at a number of large , specialist hospitals .
meanwhile , more cash is being handed over to community services and away from hospital budgets in coming years .
however , concerns remain .
bob lacey , a tory councillor on east sussex county council and chairman of a committee set up to scrutinise the changes being made in surrey and sussex , does not believe the infrastructure is yet in place to support a major reorganisation of services .
" the problem is that they want to push ahead with changes before they have good enough community facilities in place to cope . "

the new microchips could be used in personal computers , mobile phones and in domestic white goods .
the swansea university team will work with the uk 's two largest semiconductor companies - zetex and x-fab .
the university said " smart chip " technology could save £ 211bn -lrb- $ 400bn -rrb- annually in electric costs world-wide .
the research team at swansea university 's electronics systems design centre were awarded the funding by the department of trade and industry . "
the commercial potential is massive " petar igic , swansea university the grant followed a three-year industrial research project , funded by the welsh assembly government .
petar igic , director of the swansea centre , said energy management in areas such as pc power supplies , domestic white goods , mobile telecommunications and the automotive and aerospace industries could deliver reductions in energy wastage .
" the technology has the capacity to make a significant impact on sustainability issues in the field of engineering , " said dr igic .
" the commercial potential is massive .
" for example , the production of a single chip motor drive with efficient speed control used in white goods such as washing machines , would on its own save 20 % of current energy usage per house . "
' knowledge-based economy ' welsh enterprise minister andrew davies said research such as the microchip project was increasingly important to the welsh economy .
he said : " the assembly government is actively assisting collaboration between industry and academia to further increase the research and development capacity of wales .
" it is a key element in the development of a sustainable knowledge-based economy .
" swansea university 's success is gaining this additional funding is a tremendous achievement and will further raise the profile of the expertise within welsh academic institutions . "

this year 's show has featured an extended cast of 22 larger-than-life personalities , manipulated by a more complicated series of comings and goings than ever before .
the days of contestants being picked off one by one each friday night seem to have disappeared for good in a show that has sometimes proved hard to keep up with .
proceedings got off to a rocky start when shahbaz and the aristocratically-connected george voluntarily left the compound .
dawn - ejected for allegedly making contact with the outside world - was another early loser .
smudged make-up eventual finalist aisleyne and sam were drafted in to fill the breach - but the dizzying changes in personnel had only just begun .
have your say " with clever editing bb quickly brainwashed the viewers into making pete a winner " sue , nottingham send us your comments the producers ' master plan was putting a secret extension on the house and filling it with some brand new contestants and aisleyne , who was duped into thinking that her big brother moment was up .
the londoner was then subjected to the rigours of throwing out newcomers from the " house next-door " , which prompted tears and smudged make-up , but no lasting damage .
the new housemates joined the main action , making the programme seem ridiculously crowded .
this year the show 's makers sailed close to the wind , even angering some of their viewers on one occasion .
they denied claims of fixing a public lottery which saw tea-drinking susie finally slip into the big brother compound after three failed auditions .
but the move which seemed to fly in the face of the programme 's very ethos was bringing back evictees for a second dose of fame .
viewers complained in their thousands , riled that ousted housemates were back in the public voting frame - and leaving an inquiry hanging over channel 4 's head .
natural historian desmond morris branded this series the cruellest yet , while others have commentated that housemates grow more extreme every year .
sam , a man who dresses as and refers to himself as a woman , was swiftly evicted .
and there was more than one pair of enhanced breasts , with 35-year-old lea taking the honour for the most mind-boggling .
pete , the runaway favourite to win the show from an early stage , initially astonished with his involuntary tourette 's outbursts - but soon this was less head-turning than lea 's assets .
convoluted after the disturbing brawl of the fifth series , the best this year 's outing could muster was a glass of water hurled by grace into susie 's face as she was evicted to a chorus of boos .
to keep the romantics glued , a love story blossomed between pete and nikki , thanks to her controversial second chance on the show .
subtitled welsh language exchanges between glyn and imogen added a touch of delight to the proceedings .
but this series has stood out for the makers ' increasingly convoluted efforts to keep the format punchy and viewers hooked to the saturation coverage on channel 4 and its sister channels .
at times it looked as though the producers were hurriedly coming up with ideas to grab the tabloid headlines with a large group of contestants which never seemed to diminish .
this series has excelled in being complicated and a little rushed when the winner seemed obvious from the earliest days .
maybe next year 's outing should go back to basics , and allow its characters rather than the convoluted plot to take centre-stage .

this year 's show has featured an extended cast of 22 larger-than-life personalities , manipulated by a more complicated series of comings and goings than ever before .
the days of contestants being picked off one by one each friday night seem to have disappeared for good in a show that has sometimes proved hard to keep up with .
proceedings got off to a rocky start when shahbaz and the aristocratically-connected george voluntarily left the compound .
dawn - ejected for allegedly making contact with the outside world - was another early loser .

the londoner was then subjected to the rigours of throwing out newcomers from the " house next-door " , which prompted tears and smudged make-up , but no lasting damage .
the new housemates joined the main action , making the programme seem ridiculously crowded .

the oscar-winning director was given three years ' probation , california officials said .
he did not appear at the hearing but entered the plea through his lawyer , the district attorney 's office said .
during his arrest , gibson made what he has said were " harmful " anti-semitic comments .
he subsequently apologised .
gibson said he had suffered a relapse in his battle with alcoholism .
he was arrested on 28 july after being seen driving at 87mph -lrb- 139km / h -rrb- on a 45mph -lrb- 72km / h -rrb- stretch of malibu 's pacific coast highway , the local sheriff 's department said .
court deal gibson pleaded no contest to driving with excess alcohol in his blood .
but in a deal with the court , two other charges - driving under the influence and having an open bottle of tequila in his car - were both dropped .
" this was an appropriate outcome which addresses all the public safety concerns of drinking and driving , " prosecutor gina satriano said .
a no contest plea is not an admission of guilt , but for sentencing purposes it is equivalent to a guilty plea .
authorities said his blood-alcohol level was found to be 0.12 % .
the legal limit in california is 0.08 % .
gibson was ordered to attend alcoholics anonymous meetings five times a week for four-and-a-half months , and then three per week for a further seven-and-a-half months .
the actor also has to complete a three-month alcohol education and counselling programme for first-time offenders .
public information film gibson had also volunteered to appear in a public information film on the hazards of drink-driving , but that was not made a condition of his sentence .
los angeles county sheriff lee baca has so far denied the media access to audio and video tapes of gibson 's arrest on the grounds that they are part of an " investigatory file " and exempt from public records laws .
the issue arose because a sheriff 's spokesman said gibson 's arrest occurred " without incident " , and made no mention of the anti-semitic remarks .
asked whether the tapes would be released , mr baca said : " i 'm looking at that right now - i 've got to go back and look at everything that was there . "
gibson , 50 , is due back in court for a progress report in january .
he won a best director oscar for his 1995 film braveheart , in which he also starred .
his 2004 biblical epic , the passion of the christ , was recently named the most controversial movie to date by us magazine entertainment weekly .

the oscar-winning director was given three years ' probation , california officials said .
he did not appear at the hearing but entered the plea through his lawyer , the district attorney 's office said .
during his arrest , gibson made what he has said were " harmful " anti-semitic comments .
he subsequently apologised .
gibson said he had suffered a relapse in his battle with alcoholism .
he was arrested on 28 july after being seen driving at 87mph -lrb- 139km / h -rrb- on a 45mph -lrb- 72km / h -rrb- stretch of malibu 's pacific coast highway , the local sheriff 's department said .
court deal gibson pleaded no contest to driving with excess alcohol in his blood .
but in a deal with the court , two other charges - driving under the influence and having an open bottle of tequila in his car - were both dropped .
gibson was stopped on the pacific coast highway in malibu " this was an appropriate outcome which addresses all the public safety concerns of drinking and driving , " prosecutor gina satriano said .
a no contest plea is not an admission of guilt , but for sentencing purposes it is equivalent to a guilty plea .
authorities said his blood-alcohol level was found to be 0.12 % .
the legal limit in california is 0.08 % .
gibson was ordered to attend alcoholics anonymous meetings five times a week for four-and-a-half months , and then three per week for a further seven-and-a-half months .
the actor also has to complete a three-month alcohol education and counselling programme for first-time offenders .
public information film gibson had also volunteered to appear in a public information film on the hazards of drink-driving , but that was not made a condition of his sentence .
los angeles county sheriff lee baca has so far denied the media access to audio and video tapes of gibson 's arrest on the grounds that they are part of an " investigatory file " and exempt from public records laws .
the issue arose because a sheriff 's spokesman said gibson 's arrest occurred " without incident " , and made no mention of the anti-semitic remarks .
asked whether the tapes would be released , mr baca said : " i 'm looking at that right now - i 've got to go back and look at everything that was there . "
gibson , 50 , is due back in court for a progress report in january .
he won a best director oscar for his 1995 film braveheart , in which he also starred .
his 2004 biblical epic , the passion of the christ , was recently named the most controversial movie to date by us magazine entertainment weekly .
